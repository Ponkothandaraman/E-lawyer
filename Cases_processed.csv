These two appeals are directed against the impugned judgment and order dated           09.05.2014 passed by the High Court1 dismissing the criminal appeal filed by the           appellants challenging the order of conviction against them whereby the appellants           were convicted under Section 302 IPC r/w Section 34 IPC. One of the accused–           appellant, Inderjeet Singh, was also held guilty and convicted under Section 27 of the           Arms Act and were sentenced to undergo imprisonment for life and a fine of           Rs.5000/- each, in default of payment to undergo Simple Imprisonment for 3 months.           Accused–appellant, Inderjeet Singh, was also sentenced to Rigorous Imprisonment Signature Not Verified            for one year under Section 27 of the Arms Act and this sentence was to run Digitally signed by NEETU KHAJURIA Date: 2020.10.12 16:45:01 IST Reason:            concurrently with the sentence already awarded to him under Section 302 IPC.          1High Court of Delhi                                                             1 2.    In brief the prosecution case is that on 03.08.1990, on receipt of DD No. 18-A,  SI Joginder Singh along with SI Gian Singh, Constable Jai Singh and Constable  Narender Pal reached Sukhdev Market on the street which goes to Qumayun  Restaurant, where near House No. H-801 a crowd was gathered and they came to  know that injured had been removed to AIIMS in a PCR vehicle. Leaving Constable  Narender Pal at the spot, SI Joginder Singh along with other police officials reached  AIIMS, where he came to know that injured Devinder Singh @ Ladi was declared as  ‘brought dead’. Two brothers of the deceased, namely, Parminder Singh and Amar  Singh, were found present in the hospital. Parminder Singh gave his statement to SI  Joginder Singh to the effect that he has six brothers and his three brothers, namely,  Harinder Singh, Ravinder Singh and Rajinder Singh reside with his mother Smt.  Prakash Wati at House No.826/5, Arjun Nagar. His eldest brother Amar Singh resides  at House No.15/88, Geeta Colony along with his family and he along with his family  resides at 53/F, D-12 Area, Sector 4, Bangla Sahib Marg, New Delhi. His sister Saroj  resides at 98-A Baba Kharak Singh Marg along with her family. About three years  ago, one person namely Khazan Singh had been murdered and his brother Devinder  Singh @ Ladi had been arrested for his murder and a case for murder was pending  against him. He was released on interim bail from the Court and used to reside with  his sister Saroj. On 3.8.1990 Devinder Singh @ Ladi came to the house of his mother  and his other brother Amar Singh also reached there and they had their meals together.  At about 10:00 PM, Parminder Singh along with his brothers, Devinder Singh@ Ladi  and Amar Singh left the house for going to their respective houses. They were  moving on foot towards taxi stand situate in Sukhdev Market. He and Amar Singh  were about ten paces ahead of Devinder Singh @ Ladi . At about 10:10 PM, when                                             2 they reached near the corner of Sukhdev Market, they heard Devinder Singh @ Ladi  raising an alarm ‘Bachao-Bachao’ and on turning back, they saw that Amar Singh, S/o  Likhi Chand and Shiv Charan, S/o Pooran Chand were giving hockey blows and one  Inder Singh, S/o Khazan Singh was giving knife blows to Devinder Singh @ Ladi.  His brother Devinder Singh@ Ladi fell on the ground and Inderjeet Singh gave him  many knife blows. When they tried to rescue their brother, all the above three accused  persons brandished their knife and hockeys and warned that whosoever will come to  save Devinder Singh, they will also kill him. Thereafter all of them ran towards  Bhisham Pitamah Marg, his brother Devinder Singh became unconscious. Many  persons including Sujan Singh, S/o Ram Singh assembled there. After sometime, PCR  van came and removed Devinder Singh to AIIMS, where he was declared dead by the  Doctor.    3.    On this statement, a case was got registered and investigation was conducted  by Inspector Richpal Singh. During investigation, Inspector got the spot  photographed, prepared site plan, seized one broken piece of hockey, one pair of dirty  white shoes, one steel strip, sample blood, blood stained earth, sample earth from the  spot. Inspector also seized the blood stained clothes of Amar Singh and Parminder  Singh, got conducted the post mortem on the dead body of the deceased, recorded the  statement of witnesses and collected the post mortem report. Inspector arrested the  accused persons and recorded the disclosure statement of accused Inderjeet Singh @  Inder, who got recovered the knife, which was used to commit the murder. Inspector  also recorded the disclosure statements of accused Amar Singh and Shiv Charan, who  got recovered the hockeys, used in commission of offence. The recovered items were                                             3 sealed separately in pulandas and were sent to CFSL.            After completion of  investigation, challan under Section 302/506/34 IPC was filed in the Court of  concerned Metropolitan Magistrate, who committed this case to the Court of Sessions.  All the accused persons pleaded not guilty to the charge framed against them and  claimed trial. Accused Inderjeet Singh was separately charged for an offence under  Section 25 and 27 of Arms Act.    4.    In order to substantiate its case, prosecution had examined 27 witnesses in all.  All the incriminating evidence was put to the accused persons while recording their  statements under Section 313 Cr.P.C., wherein they totally denied the case of the  prosecution.   5.    The Trial Court came to the conclusion that the prosecution had brought home  the guilt of the accused persons and accordingly convicted them for murder  punishable under Section 302 IPC r/w Section 34 IPC and sentenced them to Life  Imprisonment. Aggrieved by the same, the accused appellants filed an appeal before  the High Court. However, during the pendency of the appeal before the High Court,  appellant Shiv Charan, expired on 12th April, 2008 and accordingly the proceedings  against him were abated.    6.    The case set up by the appellants before the High Court was that there was  unexplained delay not only in the lodging of the First Information Report but also in  despatching a copy of the same to the jurisdictional magistrate. In the absence of any  cogent and acceptable explanation for the delay, the prosecution case was rendered                                              4 doubtful. It was further contended that although prosecution case is alleged to be  based on eye witness on account of the incident, however, Amar Singh PW-11, and  PW-5, did not support the prosecution case and thus it was not safe to rely upon the  solitary evidence of the sole remaining eye witness Parminder Singh PW-1. It was  further pleaded that the conduct of Parminder Singh PW-1 is highly unnatural which  makes his presence on the spot at the time of the incident doubtful. It was pointed out  that no effort was made to take his injured brother to the clinic of Doctor Bhardwaj,  which was just nearby. Amar Singh PW-11, who was declared hostile stated in his  evidence that there was darkness at the time of the incident and nobody recognised the  accused persons who have been falsely implicated. It was also contended that another  eye witness Sujan Singh PW-5 has also not supported the prosecution case at all. The  defence also drew the attention of the Court to MLC of the deceased Ex. PW-17/A to  show that first the name of the injured was written as unknown and thereafter the  name of Devinder Singh has been written by overwriting and in the column  maintained for recording the name and relation of who brought the injured, name of  Head Constable, Dharam Singh PCR is mentioned and again later on ‘brothers’ has  been added. It was also submitted that the solitary eye witness is a close relation of a  deceased and thus it is not safe to rely upon his sole testimony which is not  corroborated.    7.     It was further submitted that father of the appellant Inderjeet Singh was  murdered and deceased Devinder Singh was facing trial for the murder and was out on  bail and since the victim was accused of murdering the father of the appellant, the                                                5 brothers of the deceased victim had clear motive to falsely implicate the appellants in  this case.    8.     Arrest of the accused persons and subsequent recovery at their instance was  also challenged on the ground that there is no independent witness to the recovery and  police officials are giving different versions. The defence also pointed out that the  knife which was recovered had a blunt tip, as such, the injuries as mentioned in the  post mortem report were not possible to be caused by the said knife. Even, this knife  was not shown to the doctor to seek his opinion whether injuries were possible by the  said blunt knife or not. Recovery of hockey at the instance of the appellant was not  even believed by the Trial Court.    9.     However, the High Court finding that the impugned judgment does not suffer  from any infirmity or perversity which calls for interference, dismissed the appeal.    10.     We have heard learned counsel for the appellants, learned counsel for the  State-Respondent and learned counsel for the respondent.    11.    Shri Dushyant Dave, Learned Senior Counsel for the appellants submitted that  the entire incident appears to be inherently improbable. It is also pointed out that  conduct of PW-1 alleged eye witness either at the time of the incident or immediately  thereafter is not natural and does not inspire confidence which makes his presence on  the spot extremely doubtful. The other two eye witnesses have turned hostile and  nothing could be elicited from their cross-examination by the prosecution. It was                                              6 further submitted that the conviction and sentence of the appellants based upon the  sole testimony of one eye witness, whose conduct was unnatural and inconsistent with  the ordinary course of human nature making his presence at the site of incident  extremely doubtful, is highly unsafe without corroboration from other piece of  evidence.    12.    Ms. Aishwarya Bhati, Learned Senior Counsel appearing for the State  vehemently contended that two Courts have recorded concurrent finding of guilt of the  accused appellants based on the testimony of an eye witness which they found to be  reliable and there exists no legal impediment for conviction on the basis of the same.  She further submitted that evidence of a hostile witness is not to be discarded as a  whole and relevant parts thereof which are admissible in law can be relied upon by the  prosecution. She further submitted that the conviction cannot be assailed merely  because of some lacuna in investigation and any failure or omission of the  investigating officer cannot render the prosecution case doubtful or unworthy of  belief, in a case where the prosecution case is fully established by direct testimony of  eye witness duly corroborated by medical evidence.    13.    We have considered the rival submissions and carefully perused the record.    14.    The prosecution apart from other formal witnesses produced three eye  witnesses in support of its version, namely, Parminder Singh PW-1, Amar Singh PW-  11, the two brothers of the deceased and Sujan Singh PW-5. PW-11 and PW-5 turned  hostile. PW-11 was cross-examined by the prosecution. He simply denied having seen                                              7 the accused persons giving blows to his brother. He also denied having stated to the  police that he saw accused appellant Inderjeet Singh inflicting knife blows. He also  denied having stated to the police that he ran to rescue his brother. He also stated that  he was not able to see the faces of the culprits because of the darkness and thus cannot  say, if, the accused persons are the same person, who killed his brother. This alleged  eye witness specifically denied having told the police that the three accused had  murdered his brother and he had identified them as culprits.    15.    Similarly, the other eye witness PW-5 produced by the prosecution denied  having seen two boys armed with hockey sticks and one boy holding knife attacking  another boy. He also denied having identified the three accused. He stated that while  he was passing outside the house of Doctor Bhardwaj there were 4-5 persons standing  there and it was from them he came to know that person outside the house of Doctor  Bhardwaj was dead. This eye witness also denied having seen the incident. He was  cross-examined by the prosecution but nothing could be elicited therefrom.    16.   Thus the finding of guilt of the two accused appellants recorded by the two  Courts below is based on sole testimony of eye witness PW-1. As a general rule the  Court can and may act on the testimony of single eye witness provided he is wholly  reliable. There is no legal impediment in convicting a person on the sole testimony of  a single witness. That is the logic of Section 134 of the Evidence Act, 1872. But if  there are doubts about the testimony Courts will insist on corroboration. It is not the  number, the quantity but quality that is material. The time honoured principle is that  evidence has to be weighed and not counted. On this principle stands the edifice of                                              8 Section 134 of the Evidence Act. The test is whether the evidence has a ring of truth,  is cogent, credible and trustworthy or otherwise (see Sunil Kumar V/s State  Government of NCT of Delhi)2.  17.      This case primarily hinges on the testimony of sole eye witness, Parminder  Singh PW-1, brother of the deceased. As already discussed above conviction can be  based on the testimony of a single eye witness so long he is found to be wholly  reliable.     In the light of the settled legal principles we proceed to examine the  testimony of Parminder Singh PW-1 and also his conduct at the time of the incident.   18.      According to his own testimony on the fateful night at about 10:00 PM, the  three brothers (Parminder Singh PW-1, Amar Singh PW-11 and deceased Devinder  Singh @ Ladi) left the Mother’s house for their respective houses. Parminder Singh  and Amar Singh were walking a few paces ahead of Devinder Singh @ Ladi when  they heard him shouting ‘Bachao-Bachao’ when they turned around they found three  persons attacking their brother Devinder Singh @ Ladi. Accused Inderjeet Singh was  armed with a knife while accused Amar Singh and Shiv Charan were armed with  hockey sticks. He further stated that he recognised all the three accused from before  and when they try to intervene all the three persons aimed their weapons at them and  threatened to kill. Due to assault Devinder Singh @ Ladi fell down on the ground and  became unconscious and thereafter the accused persons fled from the place. He also  stated that while they were taking care of the injured brother the police van arrived at  the spot in which Devinder Singh @ Ladi was removed to the Hospital where he was _________________________________  2. (2003) 11 SCC 367.                                               9 declared brought dead. During the cross-examination he stated that entire incident  barely lasted five minutes and they did not make any complaint to the police but the  police came of its own after about 15 minutes of the incident. He had also admitted in  the cross- examination that he did not inform his mother though she was living nearby.  He also stated that he and his brother Amar Singh went to the Hospital with injured  Devinder Singh @ Ladi in the PCR van. He also stated that he informed the Doctor  who examined Devinder Singh @ Ladi as to the manner in which he sustained  injuries. He also stated that Devinder Singh @ Ladi sustained injury on his head on  account of hockey blows however he did not bleed from his head.    19.   The unnatural conduct of Parminder Singh PW-1 and Amar Singh PW-11 the  two brothers of the deceased which we have noticed from record is that though they  claim to be present at the time of occurrence no attempt was made by them to save  their brother from assault. Though PW-1 has tried to explain in his examination in  chief that when they tried to intervene and save their brother Devinder Singh @Ladi  all the three accused persons aimed their weapons at them and threatened that in case  they intervened they would also be killed. It may be relevant to notice that Amar  Singh PW-11 neither in statement in chief nor in his cross-examination by the  prosecution after being declared hostile stated about any efforts made either by him or  by PW-1 Parminder Singh to save their brother Devinder Singh @ Ladi when he was  attacked. On the contrary PW-11 stated in his examination in chief that he was not  able to run because of his spinal injury. In the cross-examination he categorically  stated that he never told the police that when they tried to rescue Accused Inderjeet  Singh brandished the knife and accused Amar Singh and Shiv Charan brandished                                             10 hockey towards them threatening to kill anyone who comes to rescue Devinder Singh  @ Ladi.    He also denied in the cross-examination having ever being given any  statement to the police that he had identified the culprits or accused Inderjeet Singh  has stabbed with knife and accused Amar Singh gave hockey blows and the front  portion of the hockey had broken because of assault and the 3rd accused Shiv Charan  also gave hockey blows.    20.   The assailants were only armed with hockey sticks and a knife and not with any  fire arms. It seems very unnatural that two brothers present on the spot will not even  make slightest attempt to intervene and try to save the other brother being assaulted,  merely on the threat extended by the assailants armed with hockey sticks and a knife.  This unnatural conduct totally against natural human behaviour casts a serious doubt  of shadow on the presence of eye witness on the spot at the time of occurrence.  Moreover the facts stated by PW-1 Parminder Singh in this regard, as already  discussed above, has not been corroborated by the other brother Amar Singh PW-11.    21.   The other unnatural conduct of two brothers PW-1 and PW-11 just after the  incident again makes their presence on the spot extremely doubtful. There was a  medical clinic of Doctor Bhardwaj just nearby the place of incident and the first  endeavour of the two brothers would have been to take injured brother to the clinic for  immediate medical aid or try and get some medical aid fro m the clinic of Doctor  Bhardwaj. Admittedly, according to the statement of Parminder Singh PW-1 PCR Van  arrived after about 15 minutes. During this period no effort was made to either take                                               11 the injured brother to the clinic or to call Doctor Bhardwaj for some first aid. This is  totally against normal human behaviour.    22.    Further no effort is alleged to have been made to either shift the injured to any  hospital or even inform the police. It is highly unnatural that two real brothers made  no efforts to save the life of third brother who was severely injured if they were  present at the place of the incident. The PCR van is stated to have arrived after 15  minutes on the basis of information given by some unknown person regarding a  person lying injured in front of Qumayun Hotel. PW-20 lady constable Renu in her  evidence stated that on the fateful night she was posted at PCR Van when at about  10:27 PM an unknown person made a call to inform that one man was lying  unconscious near Qumayun Hotel, Defence Colony which was registered as DD No.-  493. It was on the information given by an unknown, the PCR Van reached at the site  of the incident and shifted the injured to AIIMS where he was declared brought dead.    23.    According to the prosecution story the two brothers, namely, Parminder Singh  PW-1 and Amar Singh PW-11 accompanied the injured to the Hospital in the PCR Van  and were present during his medical examination. However, a perusal of the MLC Ex.  PW-17/A filed in Volume-II of additional document goes to show that in the column  meant for recording name initially unknown is mentioned and subsequently Devinder  Singh @ ladi has been recorded. Likewise in the column made for recording the name  of relative or friend initially Head Constable ‘Dharam Singh’ is entered and after  recording the words ‘V/C’ V-89 PCR No. 1008/PCR in the second line words ‘and  brothers’ appears to have been added.                                             12 24.     This in itself casts serious doubts of shadow on the prosecution story that two  brothers of the deceased, namely, Parminder Singh PW-1 and Amar Singh PW-11  were present on the spot and accompanied the injured in PCR Van to AIIMS. Had it  been so, naturally, they would have given the name of the deceased and their own  names which would have been recorded in the MLC Ex. PW-17/A at the first instance.  Doctor Romesh Lal PW-17/A who prepared the MLC stated in his evidence that one  dead body was brought in the casualty of AIIMS by Head Constable Dharam Singh  having multiple sharp deep injuries all over the body and he prepared the MLC PW-  17/A.    25.     The facts discussed hereinabove makes the presence of eye witness at the place  of occurrence all the more doubtful and highly improbable. Since there are serious  doubtful aspects in the conduct of PW-1 Parminder Singh and his conduct does not  appear to be natural it would not be safe to accept his evidence without corroboration  more particularly when two other eye witnesses, one being a real brother of the  deceased has turned hostile.    26.     Further, there is material discrepancy between ocular testimony and medical  evidence. Post-Mortem on the dead body of the deceased Devinder Singh @ ladi was  conducted by Doctor M. S. Sagar PW-21. On external examination following anti  mortem injuries were noticed:-          1.    Multiple contusions and abraded contusions over both forearms, both               arms and dorsum of both hands.          2.

Contusions right mandibular region extending to neck of size 6 cm x       3 cm. 4.    Incised wound on the right side of forehead 1 cm below     hairline of       size 1.5 x 1 cm superficial.  5.    Incised wound left upper limb vertically placed of size 1.5 x 1 cm x       muscle deep with clean cut inverted margins.  6.

Incised wound left forearm anterio-medical aspect placed 5 cm       below cubital fossa of size 1.5cm x 1cm x muscle deep with clean cut       inverted margins underline subcutaneous tissue and muscle clean cut.  10.   Incised wound right side of abdomen placed 10 cm below coastal       margins in mid axillary plane 3 cm x 1 cm into muscle deep obliquely       placed, margins clean cut, not penetrating the abdominal cavity.  11.   Stab wound right side of chest anterior axillary plane obliquely       placed of size 3.5 cm x 1 cm, 22 cm below cavicular with clean cut       everted margins passing through 7th intercoastal plane entering into left       lower lobe of lung going into pericardium with presence of hemo-       pericardium and incised wound left pentricle around apex of size 2 cm       x 1.5 cm x whole thickness of ventricle.  12.   Stab wound of size 4 cm x 1 cm x skin deep placed transversely 8     cm       below injury no. 11.  13.   Incised wound 1 cm x 1 cm with clean cut inverted margins placed 2       cm lateral and 1.5 cm below injury no. 12.  14.   Stab wound left side of abdomen in posterior axillary line placed 25 cm       below clavicular margins of size 4 cm x 1 cm going into abdominal       cavity producing multiple incised wound of small and large intestines.  15.   Incised wound of size 4 cm x 1.5 cm in left side of abdomen 6 cm       below and 2 cm medial to injury no. 14.                                       14              Internal examination of the deceased revealed:-               There were homo-thorax on left side with about 500 cc of blood being              present. There was stab wound of left lung lower lobe of size 3 cm x 1.5              cm x 4 cm. Hemo-cardium was also present with 400 cc of blood and              blood clots. There was stab wound of heart over apex of size 2.5 cm x 1              cm x whole thickness of left ventricular wall with cutting of cordae-              tendenae. In the abdominal cavity, there was hemo-periteneum about              400 cc of blood and blood clots with multiple incised wound of small              and large intestines.               It was opined that cause of death was shock as a result of multiple              antemortem injuries produced by sharp edged weapon.               Injury no.11 and 14 are sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course              of nature individually as well as collectively.   27.   Thus, there are total 15 injuries inflicted by three assailants, two having hockey  sticks and one knife as per prosecution story. Parminder Singh PW-1 emphatically  stated that whole incident barely lasted five minutes. It would be practically  impossible to inflict 15 injuries of the type by three assailants simultaneously  attacking the deceased within a short span of 5 minutes particularly when the victim  being a normal healthy person naturally must have offered resistance. Inflicting 15  injuries on the body of the deceased by three accused persons would require a  considerable amount of time. This itself suggest that three accused had sufficient time  at their disposal to conduct the crime and the entire incident could not have taken  place within five minutes as stated by eye witness Parminder Singh PW-1. This fact  coupled with the fact that two brothers of the deceased remained a mute spectator  when the third brother was being assaulted is clear indication of the fact that PW-1  Parminder Singh was not present on the spot and not an eye witness of the incident.                                               15 28.    Dr. M.S. Sagar in his Post-Mortem report has opined that the cause of death  was due to shock due to multiple ante mortem injuries caused by sharp edged weapon  and injuries No. 11 and 14 were individually and collectively sufficient to cause death  in ordinary course of nature. He further opined in his statement that injuries have been  caused by sharp edged weapon and since no weapon was shown to him, he has not  given any opinion. Admittedly the tip of knife which was recovered on the disclosure  statement of accused appellant Inderjeet Singh was broken and it was not pointed but  blunt. Whether the type of stab and incised wound found on the body of the deceased  could have been inflicted by a knife with a broken tip, is in our opinion, extremely  doubtful. The opinion of the Doctor has not been obtained as to whether such injuries  could have been caused by knife with a broken tip by showing him the same.    29.    In the facts and circumstances of the case this was serious lapse on the part of  the investigating officer. Though normally minor lapses on the part of the  investigating officer should not come in the way of accepting eye witness account, if  otherwise reliable. But in the circumstances of the case at hands where the conduct of  sole eye witness is unnatural and there are various other surrounding circumstances  which make his presence at the site of incident doubtful, such a lapse on the part of the  investigating officer assumed significance and is not liable to ignored.    30.    While emphasizing the importance of eliciting the opinion of medical witness  in such circumstances this Court in the case of Kartarey and Ors. V/s State of U.P.3  ________________ 3. (1976) 1 SCC 172.                                               16 has observed as under:-               “We take this opportunity of emphasizing the importance of       eliciting the opinion of the medical witness, who had examined the       injuries of the victim, more specifically on this point, for the proper       administration of justice particularly in a case where injuries found are       forensically of the same species, example stab wound, and the problem       before of the Court is whether all or any those injuries could be caused       with one or more than one weapon. It is the duty of the prosecution,       and no less of the Court, to see that the alleged weapon of the offence,       if available, is shown to the medical witness and his opinion invited as       to whether all or any of the injuries on the victim could be caused with       that weapon. Failure to do so may sometimes, cause aberration of the       course of justice”.    31.    The same has been again asserted by this Court in Ishwar Singh V/s State of  U.P.4 by observing as under:-                “It is the duty of the prosecution, and no less of the Court, to see        that the alleged weapons of the offence, if available, is shown to the        medical witness and is opinion invited as to whether all or any of the        injuries on the victim could be caused with that weapon. Failure to do so        sometimes, cause aberration of the course of justice. On the basis of the        evidence on record it is difficult to say whether the injury to the deceased        was caused by the knife with a broken tip which was ceased. These        variations relate to vital parts of the prosecution case, and cannot be        dismissed as minor discrepancies. In such a case, the evidence of the eye        witness “cannot be accepted at its face value”, as observed by this Court        in Mitter Sen and others V/s State of U.P.”5 32.    The conviction of the appellants rests on the oral testimony of PW-1 who was  produced as eye witness of the murder of the deceased. Both the Learned Sessions  Judge, as well as High Court have placed reliance on the evidence of PW-1 and    _________________ 4. (1976) 4 SCC 355. 5. (1976) 1 SCC 723   ordinarily this Court could be reluctant to disturb the concurrent view but since there                                             17 are inherent improbabilities in the prosecution story and the conduct of eye witness is  inconsistent with ordinary course of human nat"

Leave granted.                           2.      The challenge in the present appeals is to a judgment and order                                   passed by the Division Bench of the High Court of Kerala on 3 rd                                   September, 2019 whereby the order passed by the learned Single                                   Bench of the High Court on 8th January, 2019 was set aside.                            3.      The facts leading rise to the present appeals are that an                                   advertisement was published on 16th April, 2007 to fill up six posts                                   in the Kerala Higher Judicial Service in terms of Kerala State Higher                                   Judicial Services Special Rules, 19611.   The selection process in Signature Not Verified                                     pursuance of such advertisement was challenged by the appellant Digitally signed by INDU MARWAH Date: 2020.03.04 16:57:17 IST Reason:                                    in respect of minimum age which was fixed as 35 years.           The                           1    for short, ‘Rules’                                                                                                       1      Kerala High Court struck down the eligibility in respect of minimum       age vide order dated 12th November, 2009.            The Special Leave       Petition against the said order was dismissed on 15 th December,       2009. After the said order, four candidates, namely, Babu, Kauser,       Edappagath and Badharudeen were selected against general merit       vacancies whereas three others were selected against the posts       meant for reserved category.   4.   The appellant disputed such selection process before this Court.       Writ Petition No. 200 of 2010 filed by the appellant was disposed of       by this Court on 14th May, 2010 granting liberty to the appellant to       move the High Court after observing that the writ petition involves       an important question of public importance.         It is thereafter, the       appellant filed Writ Petition No.16206 of 2010 before the High       Court challenging the grant of moderation/grace marks to the       candidates who were appointed on 30th March, 2009 and sought his       appointment as District and Sessions Judge. The said writ petition       was allowed by the Division Bench of the High Court on 13 th       September, 2010. The grant of moderation marks was found to be       unsustainable.   The High Court directed to recast the select list.       The relevant findings read as under:              “32. In the result, we are of the opinion that the decision             of the Selection Committee to grant moderation is             unsustainable in law. Therefore, all further steps             pursuant to the said decision would be unsustainable.             The resultant situation is that only the seven candidates             who were initially found eligible on the basis of their             having secured the cut off marks in the examination             should have been subjected to the viva-voce             examination and an appropriate decision regarding their                                                                               2                suitability to fill up the originally advertised 6 posts                should have been taken by the 1st respondent in                accordance with law.                 33. However, in view of the subsequent decision of the                1st respondent to fill up 10 posts, the 1 st respondent may                now proceed with the selection from out of the 7                abovementioned candidates in accordance with law by                recasting the select list.….”   5.   The said order was challenged by three candidates who were       appointed with the aid of grace marks before this Court by filing       SLP Nos. 27701-27702 of 2010.            The SLPs were dismissed on 8 th       October, 2010.   6.   The revised merit list of qualified candidates was prepared who       were found eligible to be appointed as District Judges. The select       list of candidates eligible for appointment as District Judges in the       Kerala State Higher Judicial Service in the six notified vacancies       was finalised as under:                 Turn No.             Roll   Name              of   Rank   Community      Sl.

In pursuance of the said select list, the appellant was appointed in       the cadre of District Judge vide order dated 22 nd December, 2010       issued by the Government of Kerala. The relevant extract from the       order reads as under:                                                                                           3            “4.

(Ms.) No. 39/2009/Home dated 30th March, 2009 to              continue in service with effect from 21-5-2009 i.e., the              date on which they assumed charge and (ii) appointing              Shri Jayachandran C. as District and Sessions Judge in the              Kerala Higher Judicial Service with effect from the date              he assumes charge. It has also requested to cancel the              appointment of Smt. Sulekha M., Shri Balakrishnan K.              and Smt. Nazeera S. as District and Sessions Judges, as              they are not qualified in the written examination. Since,              out of the four persons recommended in the select list,              three persons namely Shri Babu K., Shri Kauser              Edappagath and Shri Badharudeen A., have already been              appointed as per notification issued as G.O. (Ms.) No.              39/2009/Home dated 30th March, 2009 and published as              S.R.O. No. 292/2009 in the Kerala Gazette Extraordinary              No. 704 dated 30th March, 2009 and they are allowed to              continue in service as per G.O. (Ms.) No. 280/2010/Home              dated 22-12-2010 no fresh notification in respect of them              is required. Accordingly, Shri Jayachandran C. is to be              appointed as District and Sessions Judge and              appointments in respect of other three persons referred              to above, who are not qualified are to be cancelled.”   9.    In pursuance of such an order, the appellant joined on 24 th        February, 2011 in the cadre of District and Sessions Judge.   10.   After the advertisement was published for direct recruitment, six                                                                             5       officers were promoted by transfer to the cadre of District Judge        including Shri John K. Illikkadan on 29th May, 2007 but without        prejudice to the claim of the candidates to be recruited directly        from Bar. Subsequently, Smt. K.P. Indira was promoted by transfer        on 16th May, 2008, wherein the Government Order specifically        stated that these appointments were without prejudice to the claim        of the direct recruits, which was already underway vide notification        dated 16th April, 2007. On 2nd July, 2010, Shri Mohd. Vaseem and        Smt. Sophy Thomas, respondent Nos. 11 and 12 were promoted        and appointed by transfer to the cadre of District Judge.        Their        promotion was subject to the result of W.P. (C) Nos. 21094/09,        25168/09, 23647/09, 20683/09, 25561/09 and 25914/09 before the        High Court. Such writ petitions were disposed of on 12 th October,        2010 in the light of the order passed in the writ petition filed by the        appellant which was decided on 13th September, 2010.   11.   On 9th December, 2010, the Administrative Committee of the High        Court resolved to fix the cadre strength of District Judges at 99.   12.   The appellant submitted a representation on 11th April, 2012        claiming notional seniority with effect from the date of appointment        of other candidates through the same selection i.e. w.e.f. 30 th        March, 2009, as directed by the High Court.       The appellant also        submitted a reminder on 18th September, 2014.   13.   The High Court issued notice to the Officers appointed by transfer        on 2nd July, 2016 to consider the representation filed by four direct                                                                             6          recruits including the appellant and Badharudeen claiming seniority           over District Judges appointed by transfer from amongst Sub-           Judges/ Chief Judicial Magistrates. The Administrative Committee           in its meeting held on 19 th October, 2017 found that the total cadre           strength of the District Judges was 96 whereas 24 posts were to be           filled up by direct recruitment but only 18 officers were holding the           posts of District Judges.   The Administrative Committee noticed           that appointment by transfer of six promotee officers on 29 th May,           2007 was in exigency of service pending direct recruitment. The           Administrative Committee referred to Full Bench judgment of the           said Court in P. K. Haneefa v. State of Kerala2.              As per           Haneefa’s judgment, the Administrative Committee found that the           candidates appointed in excess of the quota were entitled to           seniority from the date the such candidates were adjusted against           the available vacancies within their quota.   14.      Consequent to the order of the Administrative Committee, the High           Court issued an Office Memorandum on 26 th October, 2017           assigning seniority to the appellant at Sl. No. 18 and that to           Badharudeen at Sl. No. 19; Shri John K. Illikkadan at Sl. No. 21; Smt.           K.P. Indira at Sl. No. 22; Mohd. Vaseem at Sl. No. 28 and Smt. Sophy           Thomas at Sl. No. 30.   15.      Such decision of the High Court was challenged by Shri John K.           Illikkadan and Smt. K.P. Indira through Writ Petition (C) No.           40046/2017 whereas Smt. Sophy Thomas and Mohd. Vaseem filed 2     2012 (4) KLJ 673 (FB)                                                                               7 Writ Petition (C) Nos. 40069/2017 and 40043/2017 respectively.  The High Court in its counter affidavit has, inter alia, taken the  following stand:         “12. The decision to initiate process of appointing the        District Judges including the petitioner No. 1 was taken        by the Administrative Committee as per Ex.R2 (f)        meeting held on 29.08.2006. As on 31.07.2006, the        cadre strength of the District and Sessions Judges was        96. At that time, only 18 direct recruits were in service        as against their quota of 24. 126 promotee District        Judges were in service as against their quota of 72.        Hence a total of 54 promotees were in the service        outside their quota…….Resolution of the Administrative        Committee dated 29.08.2006 and G.O. dated 29.05.2007        make it clear that petitioner No. 1 in WP(C) No.        40046/2017 was appointed against the quota set apart        for direct recruits and outside the quota fixed for        promotion.       Resolution dated 21.02.2008 of the        Administrative Committee further makes it clear that        petitioner No. 2 Smt. K.P. Indira was appointed outside        the quota fixed for appointment by transfer but purely on        ad-hoc basis.      Moreover, in the G.Os. appointing        petitioners, it has been clearly mentioned that the        appointments made there under were appointments        without prejudice to the claims of the candidates to be        recruited directly from the Bar satisfying the provisions        under Rule 2(b) of the Special Rules for Kerala State        Higher Judicial Service. The period of service rendered        by the petitioners against the posts within the quota of        direct recruits and outside the quota fixed for promotion        cannot be reckoned for the purpose of determining        seniority in the category of District and Sessions Judges.        The service based on substantive appointment within the        quota alone can be counted for the purpose of seniority.                  xx                xx                 xx         24. The further claim of Sri. C. Jayachandran was that        pursuant to the judgment of this Court in W.P. (C) No.        16206/2010 when the select list was recast, his name        was included at Rank No. 3 in the merit list. According to        him, based on the ranking assigned to him in the merit        list, he was appointed against Turn No. 41 reserved for        open merit candidates and Sri. Sadharudeen A., who was        appointed against Turn No. 41, was shifted out and                                                                       8              accommodated against Turn No. 42, a reservation              vacancy earmarked for OBC candidates.”   16.   All the writ petitions were dismissed by the learned Single Bench of        the High Court on 8th January, 2019. The learned Single Bench of        the High Court held as under:               “38. When the cadre strength was only 96 and the              number of direct recruits necessary was found to be 24              in Ext.R2(f) minutes, the fact that promotees could              continue without reversion because of the continuance of              fast track courts would not mean that there were              vacancies within the cadre, for promotees. Admittedly,              when M/s. John Illikkadan and K.P. Indira were appointed              in 2007 and 2008 on ad-hoc basis and subject to the              claims of direct recruits, M/s. Sophy and Mohamed              Vaseem, who were appointed only in 2010, by transfer,              cannot claim any right for regular appointment over and              above them. Therefore, they will not have any special              right or privilege just because their appointments were              not made conditional.”  17.   Aggrieved against the order passed by the learned Single Bench of        the High Court, three intra-court appeals were preferred before the        Division Bench of the High Court which came to be allowed on 3rd        September, 2019. The Division Bench of the High Court has taken        a view that the cadre strength has not been fixed by the        Government as is necessitated by the rules any time before 2015        when the cadre strength was resolved by the Administrative        Committee in the High Court at 99.       The High Court found that        direct recruits of the selection in question were appointed against        the quota of 1/3rd of the permanent posts in categories (1) and (2)        of the Rules prior to its amendment in the year 2008. The Division        Bench of the High Court referring to para 49 of the judgment in                                                                             9 Haneefa’s case held that there is a quota for direct recruitment  but there is no quota for by-transfer and held as under:         “24. … The Full Bench held so in Para 48: “ We have        already interpreted Rule 2(b) of the Special Rules that it        is intended to operate as a quota for direct recruitment .”        (sic) There is also no quota for by-transfer appointments,        which in no uncertain terms demonstrate that there is no        ratio applicable as per the Special Rules read with the        KS&SSR. Our decision turns on this crucial aspect of        existence of quota only in the case of the direct recruits        and that too confined to the permanent posts in category        (1) & (2) of the Special Rules taken together and the        absence of a rota and a ratio.                  xx                 xx                  xx         30. Going back to the Full Bench decision in Haneefa        P.K. (supra), it was specifically noticed in paragraph 22        that the Special Rules do not contain any rota provision.        It was held on an examination of Rule 2(b) of the Special        Rules that the latter part of the Rules insofar as the direct        recruits are concerned, by the language employed,        provides a positive and mandatory quota of 1/3 rd of the        permanent posts in the two categories as seen from the        Special Rules. We also pertinently notice that the        declaration of the Full Bench is only to that end and        cannot be taken further to find a specific quota        prescribed for the by-transfer appointments and it is so        stated in paragraph 62 that “once separate quotas are        prescribed for direct recruitment and for appointment by        transfer from the subordinate judiciary, the ratio        prescribed in the rules should be maintained against the        cadre strength”. Here, we have to notice that the Full        Bench has not found a ratio at all and the decision only        leads to a quota being made mandatory for direct        recruitment in the permanent posts in category (1) & (2)        taken together.                    xx                 xx                  xx         39. … We are quite conscious of the fact that the        peculiar situation, of the promotees having been        continued for long years in that case, and there arising a        breakdown of the “quota-rota” rule for reason of which        an equitable principle for determining inter-se seniority                                                                          10              was evolved therein; is not available here. But still the              underlined portion is applicable as the rules stand here              too, ie: the Special Rules read with KS&SSR.”   18.   The Division Bench of the High Court further held that the        Administrative Committee erred insofar as there is no quota        prescribed for by-transfer appointees. The quota is only for direct        recruits and confined to permanent posts in the cadre of District        Judges.    There is no reversion that has been affected to        accommodate the direct recruits. The Division Bench also held that        there is no break down of quota rule and that Haneefa’s case        cannot be relied on to automatically confer seniority on direct        recruits. The Court held as under:                 “43. The issue as highlighted by the A.C. in Exhibit P2 is              as to whether the direct recruits who commenced service              subsequent to the officers appointed by-transfer are              entitled to seniority above the promotees. Reliance was              placed on Haneefa P.K. (supra) and it was noticed that              the same was upheld in a Special Leave Petition by the              Hon'ble Supreme Court. The A.C. found that the Full              Bench had considered whether those appointed in excess              of the quota are entitled to seniority from the date of              their appointment and it was held that such appointees              will gain seniority only from the date their appointments              are adjusted against the vacancies within the quota.              Here, the A.C. erred insofar as there being no quota              prescribed for by-transfer appointees. As we noticed, the              quota is only for the direct recruits and that is confined              to the permanent posts in the cadre of District Judges.              The Full Bench judgment in Haneefa P.K. was elaborately              quoted, which we have distinguished herein above on              the facts available here of no reversion having been              effected to accommodate the subject direct recruits. The              A.C. then found that the by-transfer appointees were              appointed to the vacancies in the direct recruitment              quota; which is patently erroneous, since there was no              reversion effected and all the six direct recruits so                                                                            11                appointed on 30.03.2009 were appointed without                disturbing any previous appointment in the category. The                A.C. considering the issue of breakdown of quota, found                that the judgment in Haneefa P.K. covers the issue as on                01.11.2012 and that there was no deliberate inaction or                inertia on the part of the Government [read ‘High Court’]                in making appointments regularly to the post. Haneefa                P.K., according to us, considered the facts of the                recruitment of District Judges from the Bar, who were                appointed in the year 2001 and the declaration is insofar                as there being a definite quota available to the direct                recruits in the relevant Special Rules, as against the                permanent posts. We do not find any break down of                quota rule but the Full Bench cannot be relied on to                automatically confer seniority on direct recruits. All the                same, the finding that by-transfer appointments made                were to quota available to the direct recruit District                Judges cannot be countenanced. There were sufficient                vacancies in the cadre to accommodate the by-transfer                appointees as also the direct recruits at the time when                the direct recruits came into service. This amply                demonstrates that there were enough permanent                vacancies available for accommodating the direct                recruits and none from the by-transfer appointees were                occupying such permanent posts. We, hence, do not find                any reason to uphold the decision of the A.C.”   19.   The High Court further held that the Administrative Committee did        not have the power to decide on the seniority dispute between by-        transfer appointees and direct recruits.       It was found that in the        minutes of Judges’ meeting held on 12 th June, 1986, the seniority        dispute is not delegated to the Administrative Committee.             The        High Court referred to Item No. 5 of Clause II which reads as under:                 “II(5) Representation from judicial officers regarding                service problems.”   20.   It was held that inter se seniority disputes cannot be trivialized and        have to be decided by the Full Court. The Division Bench held as        under:                                                                               12              “48. … Though the issue of seniority can also be literally              termed as a service problem, we do not think that the              intention was to delegate such disputes to be decided by              the A.C. as a mere service problem. Inter-se seniority              disputes cannot be trivialised and though a problem, in              the literal sense, it falls for determination based on the              applicable rules and the evident facts, tested on the              established legal principles; which require an assertion of              a claim, hearing of affected parties and commend a              judicious adjudication. Service problems would be many              and varied and in every cause when a grievance is raised              by a Judicial Officer it would be difficult for the Full Court              to be convened; nor is it necessary. This is the power              specifically granted to the A.C, but it cannot result in              interference to the recommendations of the Full Court              made to the Governor under Article 233. We would find              the A.C, to be not conferred with the power to so              adjudicate a seniority dispute and ideally the same              should have been placed before the Full Court. We have              answered the said question which is raised in the              appeals, only for future guidance in such matters, which,              it would be inappropriate to leave undecided. We have              already held that the A.C's decision is not legally              sustainable; we also find the A.C. to have no jurisdiction              to decide the issue.”   21.   While dealing with the assignment of seniority to the appellant, it        was held that the order in the writ petition filed by the appellant        that the direction to re-cast the select list is sufficient indication        that any person newly selected would have to be assigned the        seniority as on the date of the original selection.            The Division        Bench further noticed that it was not by appellant’s fault that his        appointment was delayed.   22.   The Division Bench held that the appellant was appointed from the        day he assumes charge though, the appellant had 3 rd rank after        Babu and Kauser, who were earlier appointed, while Badharudeen,        one of the earlier appointees, was relegated to the 4 th position. It                                                                                 13 was further held that the appellant should have been given  notional seniority from the date of appointment of others though,  he would not have any claim for pay and allowances, for the period  when he had not discharged the duties but having returned such  finding, the Division Bench found that the appellant assumed  charge on 24th February, 2011 and that he joined without demur in  pursuance of Government Order dated 22 nd December, 2010 while  the other three were allowed to continue from the date they joined.  Therefore, the appellant waived his right of notional seniority. The  appellant could have filed a contempt petition or a fresh writ  petition to claim date of assuming charge as 30 th March, 2009. It  was further found that the appellant submitted representation after  more than 1 year on 11th April, 2012 followed by a reminder  representation on 18th September, 2014 i.e. more than 3½ years  when Mohd. Vaseem and Sophy Thomas continued as seniors of  the appellant. It was held that the appellant slept over his rights  and has allowed the by-transfer appointees to continue with the  seniority. It was also found that Mohd. Vaseem and Sophy Thomas  were granted selection grade earlier than the appellant which order  has not been challenged.     The Division Bench of the High Court  concluded that the appellant slept over his rights and rested  contend with the memorials, to which the High Court responded  very late; thus, interfering with the vested rights of the promotees.  The by-transfer appointees continued on the basis of their seniority  and also obtained further promotion in the cadre.                                                                       14 23.   The delay of further promotions was made basis by the Division        Bench to reject th"

SHAH, J.                            Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order           dated 7.2.2018 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Patna in Criminal           Appeal No. 209 of 2015, by which the High Court has dismissed the said appeal           preferred by the original accused and has confirmed the judgment and order of           conviction passed by the learned Sessions Court convicting the accused for the Signature Not Verified           offences punishable under Sections 376(1) and 450 of the IPC, the original Digitally signed by MEENAKSHI KOHLI Date: 2020.02.14 16:31:40 IST Reason:           accused has preferred the present appeal.                                                           1 2.    That the appellant herein – original accused was tried by the learned  Sessions Court for the offences punishable under Sections 376(1) and 450 of the  IPC. A written complaint was filed by the prosecutrix – PW5 on 16.09.2011  before the local police station against the accused alleging, inter alia, that in the  preceding night at about 11:00 p.m. she awaken after hearing some sound and  whereupon in the light of the mobile phone she found the accused – brother of  her husband whereupon she made query.            Instead of giving any reply, he  committed the rape upon her. According to the prosecution and as per the  prosecutrix, thereafter the accused ran away and after getting an opportunity she  raised alarm and the neighbours came there including one Suman Devi, her  cousin Gotini as well as Shanti Devi, her cousin mother-in-law. She disclosed  the event/incident to them. According to the prosecutrix, she informed her  mother-in-law and father-in-law who were at Gaya. At the time of incident, her  husband was away from the village. Thereafter on their arrival she came to the  police station along with them and submitted written report. FIR was registered  against the accused being P.S. Case No. 325/2011. Investigation was carried out  by the officer in-charge of Makhdumpur Police Station.            He recorded the  statement of the concerned witnesses. The clothes/apparels of the prosecutrix  were seized and were sent to FSL. He also collected the medical report from  Dr. Renu Singh, PW7, who examined the victim. Thereafter on conclusion of  the investigation, the Investigating Officer filed the chargesheet against the  accused for the offences punishable under Sections 376(1) and 450 of the IPC.                                           2 As the case was triable by the Court of Sessions, the learned Magistrate  committed the case to the Sessions Court which was transferred to the Court of  learned Additional Sessions Judge, Ist, Jehanabad, which was numbered as  Sessions Trial No. 456 of 2011/90/2012. The accused pleaded not guilty and  therefore he came to be tried by the learned Sessions Court for the aforesaid  offences.  2.1    To prove the charge, the prosecution examined in all eight witnesses  including the prosecutrix (PW5) and Dr. Renu Singh – Medical Officer (PW7).  Out of the eight witnesses, PW2, PW3 and PW4 did not support the case of the  prosecution and therefore were declared hostile. The prosecution also brought  on record the FIR, Injury Report and FSL Report. After closure of the evidence  of the prosecution, further statement of the accused under Section 313, Cr.P.C.  was recorded. The case of the accused was of total denial. Thereafter, on  appreciation of evidence on record, the learned trial Court held the accused  guilty for the offences under Sections 376(1) and 450 of the IPC. The learned  trial Court sentenced the accused to undergo 10 years R.I. for the offence under  Section 376 of the IPC and 7 years R.I. for the offence under Section 450 of the  IPC.  2.2    Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the judgment and order of  conviction and sentence passed by the learned trial Court, the accused preferred  an appeal before the High Court. By the impugned judgment and order, the                                           3 High Court has dismissed the said appeal. Hence, the accused has preferred the  present appeal.  3.    Shri Santosh Kumar, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the original  accused has vehemently submitted that in the facts and circumstances of the  case both the courts below have materially erred in convicting the accused for  the offences under Sections 376 and 450 of the IPC.  3.1   It is further submitted by Shri Santosh Kumar, learned Advocate  appearing on behalf of the original accused that the courts below have not  properly appreciated the fact that as such the medical report does not support  the case of the prosecutrix/prosecution. It is submitted that the evidence of the  prosecutrix is not supported by the medical evidence since no stains of semen or  blood were found on the clothes of the prosecutrix. It is submitted therefore  that it creates serious doubt about the credibility of the prosecutrix.  3.2   It is further submitted by Shri Santosh Kumar, learned Advocate  appearing on behalf of the original accused that there was a delay in  lodging/reporting the case to the police.  3.3   It is further submitted by Shri Santosh Kumar, learned Advocate  appearing on behalf of the original accused that both the courts below have not  properly appreciated the fact that there was a family enmity between the  accused and the family of the prosecutrix with respect to the land dispute. It is  submitted that no independent witnesses have been examined by the  prosecution. It is submitted that as there was a dispute between the accused and                                            4 the family members of the prosecutrix, non-examination of the material  independent witnesses, the case of the prosecution suffers from serious doubts.  3.4    It is further submitted by Shri Santosh Kumar, learned Advocate  appearing on behalf of the original accused that as per the doctor and the  medical report/injury report, no injury was found on the person of the victim  and private parts especially. It is submitted that therefore in the absence of any  injury the story put forth by the prosecutrix/prosecution is not believable.  3.5    It is further submitted by Shri Santosh Kumar, learned Advocate  appearing on behalf of the original accused that except the deposition/evidence  of the prosecutrix which has not been corroborated by the medical evidence,  there is no other independent and cogent evidence to connect the accused with  the guilt.  3.6    It is further submitted by Shri Santosh Kumar, learned Advocate  appearing on behalf of the original accused that even the doctor has  categorically said that there is no physical or pathological evidence of rape.  3.7    It is further submitted by Shri Santosh Kumar, learned Advocate  appearing on behalf of the original accused that even in the FSL  report/serological report of the blood and semen allegedly found on the petticoat  of the prosecutrix was inconclusive.          It is submitted that therefore the  serological report of blood and semen, allegedly found on the petticoat of the  prosecutrix, does not help the prosecution.                                             5 3.8   It is further submitted by Shri Santosh Kumar, learned Advocate  appearing on behalf of the original accused that even there are material  contradictions in the deposition of the prosecutrix. It is submitted that the  prosecutrix has deposed during trial that she had given an oral statement before  the police whereas the FIR has been lodged on the written report and the scribe  has neither been examined nor produced before the Investigating Officer.  3.9   It is further submitted by Shri Santosh Kumar, learned Advocate  appearing on behalf of the original accused that even there is a material  contradiction with respect to lodging of the FIR/the written report. It is  submitted that as per the prosecutrix she had gone to the police station at 10  O’clock and the police had enquired at 10 O’clock. However, the FIR is  registered at 4:00 p.m. It is submitted that therefore it appears that earliest  version has been suppressed and therefore the FIR is hit by Section 162 Cr.P.C.  3.10 It is further submitted by Shri Santosh Kumar, learned Advocate  appearing on behalf of the original accused that even the story put forth by the  prosecutrix in her evidence that she had seen the accused jumping the fallen  boundary wall and when she shouted the accused pushed towel in her mouth  and she identified him in mobile light is not believable at all. It is submitted  that even according to the prosecutrix she was sleeping in her room having door  closed. Thus, she will not be able to see any person doing any act outside room.  It is submitted that neither the number of the mobile nor even the mobile is  produced before the investigating officer.                                          6 3.11 It is further submitted that therefore when the conviction is based on the  sole testimony of the prosecutrix and the medical evidence does not support the  case of the prosecution/prosecutrix and the deposition of the prosecutrix is full  of material contradictions and that there was already a dispute between the  accused and the family members of the prosecutrix and no independent  witnesses have been examined, it is not safe to convict the accused solely on  such testimony of the prosecutrix. In support of the above submission, learned  counsel has heavily relied upon the decisions of this Court in the cases of Raju  and others v. State of Madhya Pradesh (2008) 15 SCC 133 as well as Rai  Sandeep alias Deepu v. State (NCT of Delhi) (2012) 8 SCC 21.  3.12 Making the above submissions and further relying upon the decisions of  this Court in the cases of Mukesh v. State of Chhattisgarh (2014) 10 SCC 327 as  well as Ravindra v. State of Madhya Pradesh (2015) 4 SCC 491, it is prayed to  allow the present appeal and quash and set aside the impugned judgment and  order passed by the High Court as well as the learned Sessions Court and acquit  the accused for the offences for which he was tried and convicted by the learned  Sessions Court, confirmed by the High Court.  4.    The present appeal is vehemently opposed by Shri Keshav Mohan,  learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the State of Bihar.  4.1   It is vehemently submitted by the learned Advocate appearing on behalf  of the respondent – State that in the present case the prosecutrix has fully  supported the case of the prosecution. It is submitted that as observed by this                                         7 Court in the cases of Ranjit Hazarika v. State of Assam (1998) 8 SCC 635 as  well as State of Punjab v. Gurmeet Singh & others (1996) 2 SCC 384, the courts  must, while evaluating evidence, remain alive to the fact that in a case of rape,  no self-respecting woman will come forward in a court just to make a  humiliating statement against her honour such as is involved in the commission  of rape on her.  4.2   Relying upon the decision of this Court in the case of Raju & others  (supra), it is submitted that as observed and held by this Court that ordinarily  the evidence of a prosecutrix should not be suspected and should be believed  and if the evidence is reliable, no corroboration is necessary.  4.3   It is further submitted by the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the  respondent – State that even otherwise in the present case the petticoat of the  prosecutrix was sent to FSL and the petticoat was having the blood as well as  semen stains. It is submitted that therefore the FSL report discloses that the  victim/prosecutrix was subjected to rape and it also discloses the involvement of  the accused.  4.4   Relying upon the decision of this Court in the case of Rajendra  Pralhadrao Wasnik v. State of Maharashtra, it is vehemently submitted by the  learned counsel appearing on behalf of the State that as held by this Court that  merely because the FSL report is inconclusive, it is not necessary that the  irresistible conclusion is only one that the accused is not guilty.                                              8 4.5   It is further submitted by the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the  respondent – State that mere absence of spermatozoa cannot discredit the  testimony of the prosecutrix, as she was examined by the lady doctor almost  after 36 hours from the date of occurrence.  4.6   It is further submitted by the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the  respondent – State that even the lady doctor, PW7 has also opined that  possibility of rape cannot be ruled out. It is submitted that as held by this Court  in the case of B.C. Deva v. State of Karnataka (2007) 12 SCC 122 that in spite  of the fact that no injuries were found on the person of the prosecutrix, yet the  prosecutrix can be relied upon.  4.7   It is further submitted by the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the  respondent – State that prosecutrix is an adult lady of full understanding. It is  submitted that therefore merely because during the medical examination doctor  did not find any external or internal injury on the body of the prosecutrix, her  statement cannot be discarded. It is submitted therefore that in the facts and  circumstances of the case, no error has been committed by both the courts  below in convicting the accused for the offences under Sections 376 and 450 of  the IPC.  4.8   Making the above submissions and relying upon the aforesaid decisions  of this Court, it is prayed to dismiss the present appeal.  5.    We have heard the learned counsel for the respective parties at length.                                             9 5.1   We have considered in detail the impugned judgments and orders passed  by the High Court as well as that of the learned trial Court convicting the  accused. We have also considered in detail the evidence on record, both oral as  well as documentary.  5.2   From the impugned judgments and orders passed by both the courts  below, it appears that the appellant has been convicted solely relying upon the  deposition of the prosecutrix (PW5). Neither any independent witness nor even  the medical evidence supports the case of the prosecution. From the deposition  of PW1, it has come on record that there was a land dispute going on between  both the parties. Even in the cross-examination even the PW5 – prosecutrix had  admitted that she had an enmity with Santosh (accused). The prosecutrix was  called for medical examination by Dr. Renu Singh – Medical Officer and PW7 –  Dr. Renu Singh submitted injury report. In the injury report, no sperm as well  as RBC and WBC were found. Dr. Renu Singh, PW7 – Medical Officer in her  deposition has specifically opined and stated that she did not find any violence  marks on the body of the victim. She has also categorically stated that there is  no physical or pathological evidence of rape. It is true that thereafter she has  stated that possibility of rape cannot be ruled out (so stated in the examination-  in-chief). However, in the cross-examination, she has stated that there was no  physical or pathological evidence of rape.  5.3   As per the FSL report, the blood group on the petticoat and the semen on  the petticoat are stated to be inconclusive. Therefore, the only evidence                                         10 available on record would be the deposition of the prosecutrix. It cannot be  disputed that there can be a conviction solely based on the evidence of the  prosecutrix.     However, the evidence must be reliable and trustworthy.  Therefore, now let us examine the evidence of the prosecutrix and consider  whether in the facts and circumstances of the case is it safe to convict the  accused solely based on the deposition of the prosecutrix, more particularly  when neither the medical report/evidence supports nor other witnesses support  and it has come on record that there was an enmity between both the parties.  5.4   Before considering the evidence of the prosecutrix, the decisions of this  Court in the cases of Raju (supra) and Rai Sandeep @ Deepu, relied upon by he  learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant-accused, are required to  be referred to and considered.  5.4.1 In the case of Raju (supra), it is observed and held by this Court in  paragraphs 11 and 12 as under:        “11. It cannot be lost sight of that rape causes the greatest distress and       humiliation to the victim but at the same time a false allegation of rape can       cause equal distress, humiliation and damage to the accused as well. The       accused must also be protected against the possibility of false implication,       particularly where a large number of accused are involved. It must, further, be       borne in mind that the broad principle is that an injured witness was present at       the time when the incident happened and that ordinarily such a witness would       not tell a lie as to the actual assailants, but there is no presumption or any basis       for assuming that the statement of such a witness is always correct or without       any embellishment or exaggeration.         12. Reference has been made in Gurmit Singh case [(1996) 2 SCC 384 : 1996       SCC (Cri) 316] to the amendments in 1983 to Sections 375 and 376 of the       Penal Code making the penal provisions relating to rape more stringent, and                                                 11       also to Section 114-A of the Evidence Act with respect to a presumption to be       raised with regard to allegations of consensual sex in a case of alleged rape. It       is however significant that Sections 113-A and 113-B too were inserted in the       Evidence Act by the same amendment by which certain presumptions in cases       of abetment of suicide and dowry death have been raised against the accused.       These two sections, thus, raise a clear presumption in favour of the       prosecution but no similar presumption with respect to rape is visualised as the       presumption under Section 114-A is extremely restricted in its applicability.       This clearly shows that insofar as allegations of rape are concerned, the       evidence of a prosecutrix must be examined as that of an injured witness       whose presence at the spot is probable but it can never be presumed that her       statement should, without exception, be taken as the gospel truth. Additionally,       her statement can, at best, be adjudged on the principle that ordinarily no       injured witness would tell a lie or implicate a person falsely. We believe that it       is under these principles that this case, and others such as this one, need to be       examined.”   5.4.2 In the case of Rai Sandeep alias Deepu (supra), this Court had an  occasion to consider who can be said to be a “sterling witness”. In paragraph  22, it is observed and held as under:        “22 In our considered opinion, the “sterling witness” should be of a very high       quality and calibre whose version should, therefore, be unassailable. The court       considering the version of such witness should be in a position to accept it for       its face value without any hesitation. To test the quality of such a witness, the       status of the witness would be immaterial and what would be relevant is the       truthfulness of the statement made by such a witness. What would be more       relevant would be the consistency of the statement right from the starting point       till the end, namely, at the time when the witness makes the initial statement       and ultimately before the court. It should be natural and consistent with the       case of the prosecution qua the accused. There should not be any prevarication       in the version of such a witness. The witness should be in a position to       withstand the cross-examination of any length and howsoever strenuous it may       be and under no circumstance should give room for any doubt as to the factum       of the occurrence, the persons involved, as well as the sequence of it. Such a       version should have co-relation with each and every one of other supporting       material such as the recoveries made, the weapons used, the manner of offence       committed, the scientific evidence and the expert opinion. The said version       should consistently match with the version of every other witness. It can even       be stated that it should be akin to the test applied in the case of circumstantial       evidence where there should not be any missing link in the chain of       circumstances to hold the accused guilty of the offence alleged against him.       Only if the version of such a witness qualifies the above test as well as all                                               12       other such similar tests to be applied, can it be held that such a witness can be       called as a “sterling witness” whose version can be accepted by the court       without any corroboration and based on which the guilty can be punished. To       be more precise, the version of the said witness on the core spectrum of the       crime should remain intact while all other attendant materials, namely, oral,       documentary and material objects should match the said version in material       particulars in order to enable the court trying the offence to rely on the core       version to sieve the other supporting materials for holding the offender guilty       of the charge alleged.”   5.4.3 In the case of Krishna Kumar Malik v. State of Haryana (2011) 7 SCC  130, it is observed and held by this Court that no doubt, it is true that to hold an  accused guilty for commission of an offence of rape, the solitary evidence of the  prosecutrix is sufficient provided the same inspires confidence and appears to be  absolutely trustworthy, unblemished and should be of sterling quality.  5.5   With the aforesaid decisions in mind, it is required to be considered,  whether is it safe to convict the accused solely on the solitary evidence of the  prosecutrix? Whether the evidence of the prosecutrix inspires confidence and  appears to be absolutely trustworthy, unblemished and is of sterling quality?  6.    Having gone through and considered the deposition of the prosecutrix, we  find that there are material contradictions.             Not only there are material  contradictions, but even the manner in which the alleged incident has taken  place as per the version of the prosecutrix is not believable. In the examination-  in-chief, the prosecutrix has stated that after jumping the fallen compound wall  accused came inside and thereafter the accused committed rape. She has stated  that she identified the accused from the light of the mobile. However, no  mobile is recovered. Even nothing is on record that there was a broken                                               13 compound wall. She has further stated that in the morning at 10 O’clock she  went to the police station and gave oral complaint. However, according to the  investigating officer a written complaint was given. It is also required to be  noted that even the FIR is registered at 4:00 p.m.         In her deposition, the  prosecutrix has referred to the name of Shanti Devi, PW1 and others. However,  Shanti Devi has not supported the case of the prosecution. Therefore, when we  tested the version of PW5 -prosecutrix, it is unfortunate that the said witness has  failed to pass any of the tests of “sterling witness”. There is a variation in her  version about giving the complaint. There is a delay in the FIR. The medical  report does not support the case of the prosecution. FSL report also does not  support the case of the prosecution. As admitted, there was an enmity/dispute  between both the parties with respect to land.        The manner in which the  occurrence is stated to have occurred is not believable. Therefore, in the facts  and circumstances of the case, we find that the solitary version of the  prosecutrix – PW5 cannot be taken as a gospel truth at face value and in the  absence of any other supporting evidence, there is no scope to sustain the  conviction and sentence imposed on the appellant and accused is to be given the  benefit of doubt.  6.    In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, the appeal is  allowed. The impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence passed  by the learned trial Court and confirmed by the High Court are hereby quashed                                            14 and set aside. The appellant is acquitted from all the charges levelled against  him and he be set at liberty forthwith, if not required in any other case.                                           ……………………………………J.

Leave granted.                            2.   This appeal, filed by the father of the deceased victim, is                           against the order dated 21.01.2019 passed by the Allahabad High                           Court, Lucknow Bench in Criminal Misc. Application No. 129789 of                           2018, in Criminal Appeal No. 1594 of 2018, whereby the High Court                           granted bail to the Respondent No.2, Sandeep Singh Hora, husband of Signature Not Verified  Digitally signed by INDU MARWAH                          the deceased victim, convicted by a judgment dated 23.7.2018 of Date: 2020.08.14 13:25:34 IST Reason:                          the Additional District and Sessions Judge/Special Judge (EC Act),                           Lucknow, hereinafter referred to as the “Sessions Court” in Sessions                                      2  Trial No.1385 of 2010, for offences under Sections 304B, 498A and  406 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry  Prohibition Act, 1961 by staying execution of the sentences of  imprisonment.     3.   By an order dated 23.7.2018 in Sessions Trial No.1385 of 2010  the Sessions Court sentenced the Respondent No.2 to Simple  Imprisonment of 3 years and fine of Rs.10,000/- under Section 498A  of the IPC and in default of payment of fine to further Simple  Imprisonment of 3 months; Life Imprisonment for offence under  Section 304B of the IPC; Simple Imprisonment for 3 years and fine of  Rs.5,000/- for offence under Section 406 of the IPC and in default of  payment of fine, further simple imprisonment of 2 months; Simple  Imprisonment for 5 years and fine of Rs.15,000/- under Section 3 of  the Dowry Prohibition Act and in default of payment of fine, further  Simple Imprisonment of 3 months and Simple Imprisonment of one  year and fine of Rs.5,000/- under Section 4 of the Dowry Prohibition  Act and, in default of payment of fine, further Simple Imprisonment of  3 months. All the sentences were to run concurrently.   4.   Being   aggrieved    by   the       conviction    and   sentence,    the  Respondent No.2 filed an appeal in the High Court which was  numbered Criminal Appeal No.9514 of 2018.             After filing the appeal,  the Respondent No.2 filed Criminal Misc. Application No.129789 of  2018 inter alia praying that he be enlarged on bail, during the  pendency of the aforesaid appeal.          The said application has been                                    3  allowed by the order dated 21.1.2019 under appeal.   5.    The High Court recorded the submission made on behalf of the  Respondent No.2 that (i) No FIR in relation to demand for dowry or  harassment had been filed before the death of the victim; (ii) the  Respondent No.2 had taken Rs. 2,50,000/- as loan from the brother of  the victim and not as dowry, which was established because the  brother of the victim had not been produced as a witness; and (iii)  that the deceased had committed suicide which was evident from the  post mortem report. The cause of death as shown in the post mortem  report was “asphyxia as a result of ante mortem hanging”.   6.    The High Court briefly recorded the submission on behalf of the  State and on behalf of the Appellant and then the submission on  behalf of the Respondent No.2, in rebuttal, that the Respondent No.2  had been framed.   7.    After recording the submissions of the respective parties, the  High Court passed a short, cryptic, non speaking order, under appeal  before this Court, which is set out hereinbelow for convenience:-        “After hearing learned counsel for the parties and going      through the record, we find force in the arguments raised by      learned counsel for the accused-appellant. Keeping in view      the facts and circumstances of the case, without commenting      anything on merits of the case, we are of the considered      opinion that accused-appellant is entitled to be released on      bail.       Let accused-appellant, namely Sandeep Singh Hora convicted      in aforesaid Sessions Trial No. 1385 of 2010 be enlarged on bail      during pendency of appeal subject to his furnishing a personal      bond and two sureties each in the like amount to the      satisfaction of court concerned.                                     4           It is clarified that no stay order has been passed in respect of       fine imposed on the accused appellant and the same shall be       deposited within four weeks from today and in default, the       accused-appellant shall be deprived from the benefit of the       bail order passed today.        The bail bonds after being accepted, shall be transmitted to       this Court for being kept on record of this appeal.”     8.     It is not in dispute that the victim died in circumstances which  were not natural, on the night of 24/25.8.2010, within about 8½  months of her marriage with the Respondent No.2 on 12.12.2009.   9.     On 25.8.2010, at about 3.05 a.m., a First Information Report  No.352/2010 was registered on the complaint of the Appellant,  pursuant to which, a criminal case being Crime No.480 of 2010 was  initiated against Respondent No.2, his parents and his sister Sonia @  Disha Chhugani under Sections 498A, 304B, 406 and 411 of the IPC  and Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act.   10.    After investigation into the case, the Investigating Officer  submitted a chargesheet against the Respondent No.2, his father  Balvir Singh, his mother Manjeet Kaur and his sister Sonia @ Disha  Chhugani.   11.    The case was committed to the Sessions Court, after which  charges were framed against the accused under Sections 498A, 304B  and 406 of IPC and Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, to  which the accused pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. The accused                                   5  were absolved of the charge under Section 411 of the IPC.   12.   In Sessions Trial No.1385 of 2010, the Prosecution examined  eight witnesses, including the Appellant, being the complainant in the  FIR, his wife, being the mother of the victim and his sister Rajendra  Pal Kaur, being the paternal aunt of the victim.    The defence also  examined five witnesses. The Respondent No.2 and the other accused  were examined under Section 313 of the Criminal Procedure Code  (CrPC).   13.   The   evidence   adduced   before   the   Sessions    Court,   has  meticulously been recorded in the judgment and order dated  23.7.2018, under appeal before the High Court. The family members  of the victim, who deposed before the Sessions Court, have given oral  evidence that the Appellant had spent money beyond his financial  capacity, for the wedding of his daughter, that is, the victim.  However, soon after the marriage of the victim to the Respondent  No.2 on 12.12.2009, the victim’s in-laws as well as the Respondent  No.2, her husband, harassed her mentally and physically for more  dowry.   14.   From the oral evidence of the victim’s parents, and other family  members, it transpires that the victim used to make phone calls to  her mother, maternal grandmother and her aunt, complaining of  harassment meted out to her by the members of her matrimonial  family.   There is oral evidence that the Appellant’s wife used to  console her by saying that things would settle down in due course.                                      6  15.     From the oral evidence it also transpires that the in-laws of the  victim used to pressurize the victim to bring cash from her parents.  On 17.6.2010, the Respondent No.2 along with his father Balvir Singh  came to Sitapur and took cash of Rs.2,50,000/- from the victim’s  brother, Pritam Singh.     From the oral evidence of the Appellant, it  transpires that on the evening of 24.8.2010, the victim rang up the  Appellant twice, complaining of atrocities.    She was frightened and  expressed fear for her life.    On the same night at 12.15 a.m. the  Appellant was informed that his daughter had died.   16.     The 2nd Prosecution Witness, being the mother of the victim,  stated that the family had spent approximately Rs.21 lacs for the  marriage of the victim.     They had gifted I-10 car, which they had  purchased, after obtaining loan against insurance policy.      However,  after marriage, the in-laws of the victim started harassing the victim,  demanding cash of Rs.15 to 20 lacs, alleged to have been promised  by her parents and also demanding a Pajero car in place of the I-10  car.   17.     The post mortem report reveals the following ante-mortem  injuries:-          “Oblique ligature mark 30 cm x 1.5 cm on front and around the        neck just above thyroid cartilage; both lungs and membranes        congested; right heart chamber full and left empty; there was        some semi-digested food material available in stomach; liver,        spleen, both kidneys congested; uterus empty and normal; the        death had possibly taken place half day before post-mortem.        As per the opinion of the witness, the deceased had died due        to asphyxia as a result of ante mortem hanging.”                                    7  18.   The Respondent No. 2 and his parents were examined under  Section 313 of the Cr.PC. They denied practically everything, except  the fact that the Respondent No.2 had married the victim on  12.12.2009. They emphasized on the fact that the victim had  committed suicide, and contended that the entire investigation had  been conducted under the supervision and instructions of a motivated  IPS officer, who was a friend of the Appellant.   19.   The Respondent No.2 and/or his parents have, in their  examination under Section 313 of the CrPC, suggested that the  deceased victim had wanted to marry some other boy, but had been  compelled by her parents to marry the Respondent No.2 and that she  frequently used to talk with and exchange messages with that boy.  There is also a suggestion that the victim had committed suicide  because of mental illness. Significantly, on the one hand it is  insinuated that her involvement with another boy led to the suicide  and on the other hand it is suggested that she committed suicide due  to mental illness. The suggestions are somewhat contradictory and in  any case the suggestion of mental illness is unsupported by any  evidence whatsoever.   20.   Through three of the witnesses examined by the defence,  namely, one Shri K.K. Pandey, Sub-Divisional Engineer, Mobile  Services (Security) who deposed as the 1st        Defence Witness, Shri  Madhu Balusu, Nodal Officer, Reliance Communications, Gomti Nagar,  Lucknow who deposed as 2nd Defence Witness, and Shri Prashant  Mishra who deposed as 3rd Defence Witness, the defence made an                                     8  attempt to establish the victim’s involvement with the said Prashant  Mishra. The evidence of the aforesaid three witnesses evinces calls  from the victim’s phone to the phone in the name of Prashant Mishra,  and from the said phone to the phone of the victim and also exchange  of some messages between the two phones.             However, the said  Prashant Mishra, who deposed as Defence witness said, that the  phone in his name was always kept at home and used by his parents  and sister.   The victim was a class friend of his sister, Prachi. He did  not know the mobile number of the victim. The victim used to talk to  his sister Prachi.   This witness deposed that he knew that the victim  had married the Respondent No.2. He said that his sister Prachi and  his mother had attended the wedding.         This witness categorically  asserted that phone calls to and from the victim from this phone  number were not made in his presence, nor were the messages  exchanged in his presence.   21.   The 4th Defence Witness, Smt. Lajwanti Chugani (mother-in-law  of Sonia @ Disha Chhugani) and the 5th Defence Witness Shri  Bhagwan Das Chugani (father-in-law of Sonia alias Disha Chhugani)  deposed that their daughter in law Sonia did not have good relations  with her parents as she had left her first husband and remarried their  son against the wishes of her parents.   22.   The Sessions Court considered the evidence adduced on behalf  of the Prosecution, including the oral evidence of the family members  of the victim, the evidence of the defence witnesses and the defence  of the Respondent No.2, his parents and his sister under Section 313                                    9  of the CrPC and thereafter convicted the Respondent No.2 as also his  parents Balvir Singh and Manjeet Kaur under Sections 498A, 304B  and 406 of the IPC and under Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry  Prohibition Act.   The Respondent No.2’s sister Sonia @ Disha  Chugani was acquitted of all the charges against her.   23.   The judgment and order of the Sessions Court, under appeal in  the High Court is based on evidence.      The oral evidence adduced  before the Sessions Court, which has meticulously been recorded in  the judgment and order dated 23.7.2008, under appeal before the  High Court, reveals that there is evidence of torture and harassment  of the victim, by the Respondent No. 2 and his parents, for more  dowry, soon after marriage, which continued till her death.         The  victims husband (Respondent No. 2) and her in laws pressurized the  victim to bring cash from her parents and also pressurized her for a  Pajero car in place of the I-10 car gifted by her parents at the time of  marriage.   The Respondent No. 2 came to Sitapur along with his  father, Balvir Singh on 17.6.2010 and took cash of Rs.2,50,000/- from  the victim’s brother, Pritam Singh. Even as late as on the evening of  24.8.2010, the Respondent No.2 went to the residence of the victim’s  aunt and threatened to put an end to the marriage. On 24.8.2010,  the victim had made frantic calls complaining of torture, and  expressing fear for her life.    From the oral evidence, it may be  reasonably inferred that she was traumatized. The same night, she  died in unnatural circumstances.   24.    It is not for this Court to go into the merits of the appeal                                   10  pending before the High Court. Suffice it to mention that prima facie  the Sessions Court has proceeded on the basis of evidence and the  Respondent No.2 has not been able to make out a case of any patent  infirmity and/or illegality in the judgment and order of the Sessions  Court.   25.   The Short question that arises for consideration in this appeal  is, whether the High Court was justified in directing release of the  Respondent No.2 on bail, during the pendency of his appeal before  the High Court.   26.   Section 389 provides that, pending any appeal by a convicted  person, the Appellate Court may, for reasons to be recorded by it in  writing, order that the execution of the sentence or order appealed  against, be suspended and, also, if he is in confinement, that he be  released on bail. Of course, in view of the mandate of Section 389(3)  of the CrPC, the principles are different in the case of sentence not  exceeding three years and/or in the case of bailable offences. In this  case, of course, none of the offences for which the Respondent No. 2  has been convicted are bailable. Moreover the Respondent No.2 has,  inter alia, been given life imprisonment for offence under Section  304B of the IPC and imprisonment for five years for offence under  Section 3 of the Dowry Prohibition Act.   27.   As the discretion under Section 389(1) is to be exercised  judicially, the Appellate Court is obliged to consider whether any  cogent ground has been disclosed, giving rise to substantial doubts  about the validity of the conviction and whether there is likelihood of                                      11  unreasonable delay in disposal of the appeal, as held by this Court in  Kashmira Singh v. State of Punjab1 and Babu Singh and Ors. v.  State of U.P.2   28.   Section 304B was incorporated in the Indian Penal Code by the  Dowry Prohibition (Amendment) Act, 1986 (Act 43 of 1986).             The  object of the amendment was to curb dowry death.           Section 304B  does not categorize death, it covers every kind of death that occurs  otherwise than in normal circumstances. Where the other ingredients  of Section 304B of the Code are satisfied, the deeming fiction of  Section 304B would be attracted and the husband or the relatives  shall be deemed to have caused the death of the bride.   29.   The essential ingredients for attraction of Section 304B are:             (i)         the death of woman must have been caused in                       unnatural circumstances.            (ii)        the death should have occurred within 7 years of                       marriage           (iii)    Soon before her death the woman must have been                   subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband                   or his relatives and such cruelty or harassment                   must be for or in connection with the demand for                   dowry, and such cruelty or harassment is shown to                   have been meted out to the woman soon before                   her death.     30.   As observed by this Court in State of Punjab v. Iqbal Singh  & Ors.3, the legislative intent of incorporating Section 304B was to  curb the menace of dowry death with a firm hand. In dealing with  1. (1977) 4 SCC 291 2. (1978) 1 SCC 579 3. (1991) 3 SCC 1                                      12  cases under Section 304B, this legislative intent has to be kept in  mind. Once there is material to show that the victim was subjected to  cruelty or harassment before death, there is a presumption of dowry  death and the onus is on the accused in-laws to show otherwise.            At  the cost of repetition, it is reiterated that the death in this case took  place within 8½ months of marriage.       There is apparently evidence of  harassment of the victim for dowry even on the day of her death, and  there is also evidence of payment of a sum of Rs.2,50,000/- to the  Respondent-Accused by the victim’s brother, two months before her  death.   31.   In Kalyan Chadra Sarkar v. Rajesh Ranjan and Anr. 4, this  Court held:-            “11. The law in regard to grant or refusal of bail is very well          settled.   The Court granting bail should exercise its          discretion in a judicious manner and not as a matter of          course. Though at the stage of granting bail a detailed          examination of evidence and elaborate documentation of          the merits of the case need not be undertaken, there is a          need to indicate in such orders reasons for prima facie          concluding why bail was being granted particularly where          the accused is charged of having committed a serious          offence. Any order devoid of such reasons would suffer from          non-application of mind.”  32.   Even though detailed examination of the merits of the case may  not be required by courts while considering an application for bail but,  at the same time, exercise of jurisdiction has to be based on well  settled principles and in a judicious manner and not as a matter of  course as held by this Court in Chaman Lal v. State of U.P. and  Anr.5.  4. (2004) 7 SCC 528 5. (2004) 7 SCC 525                                     13  33.     In Mauji Ram v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Anr. 6, this  Court referred to Ajay Kumar Sharma v. State of U.P. and Ors. 7,  Lokesh Singh v. State of U.P. and Anr. 8 and Dataram Singh v.  State of U.P. and Anr.9 and stated categorically that this Court had  time and again emphasised the need for assigning reasons while  granting bail.   34.     In Lokesh Singh v. State of U.P. and Anr. (supra), this Court  referred to Kalyan Chadra Sarkar v. Rajesh Ranjan (supra) and  set aside the impugned order of the High Court granting bail.   35.     In Ajay Kumar Sharma (supra), a three-Judge Bench of this  Court relied on Chaman Lal v. State of U.P. (supra) and set aside  order of bail granted by the High Court holding, that it was well  settled that even though detailed examination of the merits of the  case may not be required by the courts while considering an  application for bail, at the same time exercise of discretion has to be  based on well settled principles and in a judicious manner and not as  a matter of course.   36.     There is a difference between grant of bail under Section 439 of  the CrPC in case of pre-trial arrest and suspension of sentence under  Section 389 of the CrPC and grant of bail, post conviction.      In the  earlier case there may be presumption of innocence, which is a  fundamental postulate of criminal jurisprudence, and the courts may   6.   (2019) 8 SCC 17 7.   (2005) 7 SCC 507 8.   (2008) 16 SCC 753 9.   (2018) 3 SCC 22                                    14  be liberal, depending on the facts and circumstances of the case, on  the principle that bail is the rule and jail is an exception, as held by  this Court in Dataram Singh v. State of U.P. and Anr. (supra).  However, in case of post conviction bail, by suspension of operation  of the sentence, there is a finding of guilt and the question of  presumption of innocence does not arise. Nor is the principle of bail  being the rule and jail an exception attracted, once there is conviction  upon trial.      Rather, the Court considering an application for  suspension of sentence and grant of bail, is to consider the prima  facie merits of the appeal, coupled with other factors.   There should  be strong compelling reasons for grant of bail, notwithstanding an  order of conviction, by suspension of sentence, and this strong and  compelling reason must be recorded in the order granting bail, as  mandated in Section 389(1) of the Cr.P.C.   37.   In Vinod Singh Negi v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Anr. 10,  this Court set aside the impugned order of suspension of sentence  and grant of appeal as the order was devoid of reasons.   38.   It is nobody’s case that the death of the victim was accidental  or natural.   There is evidence of demand of dowry, which the Trial  Court has considered. The death took place within 7 or 8 months and  there is oral evidence of the parents of cruelty and torture  immediately preceding the death. There is also evidence of payment  of Rs.2,50,000/- to the Respondent-Accused by the victim’s brother.  The Respondent No.2 has not been able to demonstrate any apparent   10 (2019) 8 SCC 13                                     15  and/or obvious illegality or error in the judgment of the Sessions  Court, to call for suspension of execution of the sentence.   39.   In considering an application for suspension of sentence, the  Appellate Court is only to examine if there is such patent infirmity in  the order of conviction that renders the order of conviction prima  facie erroneous. Where there is evidence that has been considered  by the Trial Court, it is not open to a Court considering application  under Section 389 to re-assess and/or re-analyze the same evidence  and take a different view, to suspend the execution of the sentence  and release the convict on bail.   40.   Even though the term ‘dowry’ is not defined in the Indian Penal  Code, it is defined in the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 as any valuable  security given or agreed to be given either directly or indirectly by  one party to the marriage to the other party to the marriage, or by  any person at or before or any time after the marriage, in connection  with the marriage of the parties.   41.   It is difficult to appreciate how the High Court could casually  have suspended the execution of the sentence and granted bail to the  Respondent No.2 without recording any reasons, with the casual  observation of force in the argument made on behalf of the Appellant  before the High Court, that is, the Respondent No.2 herein. In effect,  at the stage of an application under Section 389 of the CrPC, the High  Court found merit in the submission that the brother of the victim not  having been examined, the contention of the Respondent No.2, being  the Appellant before the High Court, that the amount of Rs.2,50,000/-                                    16  was taken as a loan was not refuted, ignoring the evidence relied  upon by the Sessions Court, including the oral evidence of the  victim’s parents.   42.      From the evidence of the Prosecution witnesses, it transpires  that the Appellant had spent money beyond his financial capacity, at  the wedding of the victim and had even gifted an I-10 car. The  hapless parents were hoping against hope that there would be an  amicable settlement. Even as late as on 17.6.2010 the brother of the  victim paid Rs.2,50,000/- to the Respondent No.2. The failure to lodge  an FIR complaining of dowry and harassment before the death of the  victim, is in our considered view, inconsequential. The parents and  other family members of the victim obviously would not want to  precipitate a complete break down of the marriage by lodging an FIR  against the Respondent No.2 and his parents, while the victim was  alive.   43.      For the reasons discussed above, the appeal is allowed.               The  impugned order of the High Court is set aside and the Respondent  No.2 is directed to surrender for being taken into custody. The bail  bonds shall stand cancelled.                                                     ................................J.

The sole question of law for consideration in the present appeals is                           whether in case of a valid driving licence, if the licence has expired, the                           insured is absolved of its liability.                            2.     The facts are in a very narrow compass. The first respondent                           herein, met with an accident on 20.5.1999 while driving a truck owned  Signature Not Verified                          by the appellant herein, under whom he was gainfully employed. The Digitally signed by Anita Malhotra Date: 2020.09.23                           consequence for the first respondent was 20 per cent permanent 18:45:29 IST Reason:                              disability.   The first respondent herein filed a petition under the                                                                                                   1 Workmen’s Compensation Act, 1923 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the  Compensation Act’) before the Commissioner, Sadar, Bilaspur on  17.2.1999 seeking compensation of an amount of Rs.5,00,000/-,  impleading the appellant and second respondent herein – the insurance  company which had insured the vehicle. These proceedings resulted in  an award by the Commissioner on 8.12.2004 granting Rs. 94,464/- for  the injuries suffered and Rs.67,313/- towards medical expenses of the  first respondent. The amounts awarded were to carry interest @ 9 per  cent per annum from the date of filing of the application till the date of  payment.    The compensation amount was mulled on to the second  respondent as insurer, while the interest was directed to be paid by the  appellant herein.    3.    The parties to the proceedings all filed appeals aggrieved by  different aspects of the award. An intrinsic part of the consideration by  the High Court was the issue raised about the validity of the driving  licence of the first respondent at the time of the accident. The driving  licence was endorsed by the Superintendent of R&LA Office, Udaipur  but the licence expired on 6.9.1996 and there was no endorsement for                                                                           2 renewal thereafter. Thus, the first respondent was driving the vehicle as  the driver of the appellant herein for almost three years without the  licence being renewed.    4.    The aforesaid aspect of the non-validity of the driving licence  weighed with the High Court while passing the impugned judgment dated  3.3.2009, absolving the insurance company of any liability and fastening  the same upon the appellant herein on account of there being a material  breach of the insurance policy.    5.    The High Court, after the aforesaid finding took note of Section 4  of the Compensation Act, more specifically the following aspect:   “4. Amount of compensation –        (1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, the amount of       compensation shall be as follows, namely:-   (a) Where death results from the An amount equal to fifty per cent injury                           of the monthly wages of the                                  deceased workman multiplied by                                  the relevant factor;                                       or                                                                         3                                      An amount of eighty thousand,                                      whichever is more; (b)    Where       permanent     total An amount equal to sixty per cent disability results from the injury     of the monthly wages of the injured                                        workman multiplied by the relevant                                        factor,                                       or                                       An amount of ninety thousand                                      rupees, whichever is more.         Explanation I.-- For the purposes of clause (a) and clause (b),""       relevant factor"", in relation to a workman means the factor       specified in the second column of Schedule IV against the entry in       the first column of that Schedule specifying the number of years       which are the same as the completed years of the age of the       workman on his last birthday immediately preceding the date on       which the compensation fell due.”    6.    On consideration of the aforesaid provision, the High Court opined  that there was no provision under the Compensation Act for payment of  medical expenditure incurred by the claimant for treatment. The accident  having taken place in the year 1999, the monthly wages stated to be  Rs.4,500/-, it was found that the maximum amount of wages permissible  under the Compensation Act for determining the compensation could be  Rs.2,000/-. Compensation was liable to be paid within thirty (30) days of                                                                         4 the accident and the owner could have recovered the amount from the  insurer if ultimately it was established that the insurer was liable to have  indemnified the insured. The appellant was found to be in breach of the  statutory duty of a benevolent legislation, i.e., the Compensation Act and,  thus, the appellant was burdened to pay interest as also maximum penalty  of 50 per cent. The amount of compensation was thus quantified as  under:           “1. Amount of compensation                   = Rs. 83,968/-           2. Penalty @ 50% on the amount of          compensation                                 = Rs. 41,984/-           3. Interest w.e.f. 20.6.1999 to 3.3.2009          (9 years & 257 days) on the amount of          compensation                                 = Rs. 73,335/-”   7.       The result was that the appeals of the insurer and the claimant were  allowed. The endeavour to seek review of the judgment on the basis of  pronouncement of this Court in National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Swaran  Singh and Ors.1 failed and the application was dismissed on 8.7.2009.   8.       The only question which has been debated before us, is as set out  at the inception of the judgment. The appellant sought to rely upon the  1 (2004) 3 SCC 297                                                                             5 recent judgment of this Court, Nirmala Kothari v. United India  Insurance Company Limited.2 The question of law examined in this  judgment was as to what is the extent of care/diligence expected of the  employer/insured while employing a driver. The legal position regarding  the liability of the insurance company when the driver of the offending  vehicle possessed an invalid/fake driver’s licence was adverted to for  answering this question, by referring to earlier judicial pronouncements  and the same was culled out in para 12 as under:         “12. While hiring a driver the employer is expected to verify if the        driver has a driving licence. If the driver produces a licence which        on the face of it looks genuine, the employer is not expected to        further investigate into the authenticity of the licence unless there        is cause to believe otherwise. If the employer finds the driver to be        competent to drive the vehicle and has satisfied himself that the        driver has a driving licence there would be no breach of Section        149(2)(a)(ii) and the insurance company would be liable under the        policy. It would be unreasonable to place such a high onus on the        insured to make enquiries with RTOs all over the country to        ascertain the veracity of the driving licence. However, if the        insurance company is able to prove that the owner/insured was        aware or had notice that the licence was fake or invalid and still        permitted the person to drive, the insurance company would no        longer continue to be liable.”    9.     We have heard learned counsel for the parties and on a query being 2 (2020) 4 SCC 49 (authored by one of us, Krishna Murari, J.)                                                                            6 raised, whether there is a view taken on the question as to what would be  the consequence of a valid driving licence having expired both the  learned counsel for the appellant and learned counsel for respondent No.2  insurance company stated that there was no direct view on this point. We  even posed a question qua any judicial view of the High Courts in this  behalf, but the answer to the same was also in the negative. We reserved  the orders because we wanted to satisfy ourselves over this aspect.   10.      We have not been able to trace out any judgments of this Court but  there are judicial pronouncements of the High Courts dealing with the  issue.    11.      We consider it appropriate to first commence with the view of this  Court in the Swaran Singh.3 case, which examined the meaning of the  expression “duly licensed”, as used in Section 149(2)(a)(ii) of the Motor  Vehicles Act, 1988 (hereinafter referred to as the ‘MV Act’). The factual  matrix dealt with the claim of a third party and the different eventualities  considered were: (a) licence not held; (b) fake licence held; (c) licence  held but validity whereof has expired; (d) licence not held for type of  3 (supra)                                                                            7 vehicle being driven; and (e) learner’s licence held. We may note here  that the facts of the present case relate to eventuality (c) above. A liberal  view was taken considering the intent of the legislation in question and  that it was a case of a third party claim. In an endeavour of the insurance  company to absolve itself of liability the following observations were  made:          “41. However, clause (a) opens with the words ""that there has been         a breach of a specified condition of the policy"", implying that the         insurer's defence of the action would depend upon the terms of the         policy. The said sub-clause contains three conditions of disjunctive         character, namely, the insurer can get away from the liability when         (a) a named person drives the vehicle; (b) it was being driven by a         person who did not have a duly granted licence; and (c) driver is a         person disqualified for holding or obtaining a driving licence.          42. We may also take note of the fact that whereas in Section 3 the         words used are 'effective licence', it has been differently worded in         Section 149(2) i.e. 'duly licensed'. If a person does not hold an         effective licence as on the date of the accident, he may be liable for         prosecution in terms of Section 141 of the Act but Section 149         pertains to insurance as regard third party risks.          43. A provision of a statute which is penal in nature vis-a-vis a         provision which is beneficent to a third party must be interpreted         differently. It is also well known that the provisions contained in         different expressions are ordinarily construed differently.                                                                                 8 44. The words “effective licence” used in Section 3, therefore, in our opinion cannot be imported for sub-section (2) of Section 149 of the Motor Vehicles Act. We must also notice that the words 'duly licensed' used in sub-section (2) of Section 149 are used in past tense.  45. Thus, a person whose licence is ordinarily renewed in terms of the Motor Vehicles Act and the rules framed thereunder despite the fact that during the interregnum period, namely, when the accident took place and the date of expiry of the licence, he did not have a valid licence, he could during the prescribed period apply for renewal thereof and could obtain the same automatically without undergoing any further test or without having been declared unqualified therefor. Proviso appended to Section 14 in unequivocal term states that the licence remains valid for a period of thirty days from the day of its expiry.”  ….           ….           ….            ….           ….           ….  “48. Furthermore, the insurance company with a view to avoid its liabilities is not only required to show that the conditions laid down under Section 149(2)(a) or (b) are satisfied but is further required to establish that there has been a breach on the part of the insured. By reason of the provisions contained in the 1988 Act, a more extensive remedy has been conferred upon those who have obtained judgment against the user of a vehicle and after a certificate of insurance is delivered in terms of Section 147(3) a third party has obtained a judgment against any person insured by the policy in respect of a liability required to be covered by Section 145, the same must be satisfied by the insurer, notwithstanding that the insurer may be entitled to avoid or to cancel the policy or may in fact have done so. The same obligation applies in respect of a judgment against a person not insured by the policy in respect of                                                                       9        such a liability, but who would have been covered if the policy had        covered the liability of all persons, except that in respect of        liability for death or bodily injury.”    12.    We may next advert to the judgment in the Nirmala Kothari4 case.  The judgment was sought to be canvassed in support of the proposition  by learned counsel for the appellant and we reproduce the relevant  paragraphs in addition to the one reproduced above, as under:          “10. While the insurer can certainly take the defence that the        licence of the driver of the car at the time of accident was        invalid/fake however the onus of proving that the insured did not        take adequate care and caution to verify the genuineness of the        licence or was guilty of willful breach of the conditions of the        insurance policy or the contract of insurance lies on the insurer.         11. The view taken by the National Commission that the law as        settled in the PEPSU case is not applicable in the present matter        as it related to third-party claim is erroneous. It has been        categorically held in the case of National Insurance Co. Ltd. vs.        Swaran Singh & Ors. (SCC p.341, para 110) that,               “110. (iii)…Mere absence, fake or invalid driving licence or              disqualification of the driver for driving at the relevant time,              are not in themselves defences available to the insurer              against either the insured or the third parties. To avoid its              liability towards the insured, the insurer has to prove that the              insured was guilty of negligence and failed to exercise              reasonable care in the matter of fulfilling the condition of              the policy regarding use of vehicles by a duly licenced  4 (supra)                                                                            10              driver or one who was not disqualified to drive at the              relevant time.”   13.   The submission, thus, was that the appellant as insured had taken  adequate care by verifying the licence of the driver/first respondent at the  time of employment and the liability could have been mulled on the  appellant only if he was aware or had notice that the licence was fake or  invalid and still permitted the person to drive. This was stated not to be  the factual position in the present case as the issuance of the licence has  not been doubted, but rather that it was not subsequently renewed which  was pleaded to be the responsibility of the first respondent.   14.   We did point out at that stage itself by raising a query as to how  this judgment would help in the case of the appellant since it was not a  case of a fake or invalid licence. If the appellant was required to take  adequate care and caution to verify the driving licence at the threshold,  thereafter, the burden shifted on the insurance company to prove that  such due care was not taken, could it be said that having, at the first blush  verified the driving licence, the appellant was absolved of the  responsibility of verifying whether the driving licence was kept renewed?                                                                              11 15.    We are of the view that once the basic care of verifying the driving  licence has to be taken by the employer, though a detailed enquiry may  not be necessary, the owner of the vehicle would know the validity of the  driving licence as is set out in the licence itself. It cannot be said that  thereafter he can wash his hands off the responsibility of not checking up  whether the driver has renewed the licence. It is not a case where a  licence has not been renewed for a short period of time, say a month, as  was considered in the case of Swaran Singh5 where the benefit was  given to a third party by burdening the insurance company. The licence  in the instant case, has not been renewed for a period of three years and  that too in respect of commercial vehicle like a truck. The appellant  showed gross negligence in verifying the same.    16.    We are conscious of the fact that in the present case the beneficiary  is the driver himself who was negligent but then we are not dealing with  a claim under the MV Act but under the Compensation Act, which  provides for immediate succor, not really based on a fault theory with a  limited compensation as specified being paid.        We are, thus, in the  present proceedings not required to decide the share of the burden 5 (supra)                                                                           12 between the appellant as the owner and the first respondent as the driver  as may happen in a proceeding under the MV Act.    17.   We now turn to the views of some of the High Courts, which have  come to our notice on our own research!    18.   The Delhi High Court in Tata AIG General Insurance Co. Ltd. v.  Akansha & Ors.6 found that the driving licence having expired led to the  natural finding that there was no valid driving licence on the date of the  accident. The initial onus was discharged by the insurance company in  view of the licence not being valid on the date of the accident. The onus,  thereafter, shifted to the owner/insured to prove that he had taken  sufficient steps to ensure that there was no breach of the terms and  conditions of the insurance policy. Since no evidence had been led in this  behalf, a presumption was drawn that there was willful and conscious  breach of the terms and conditions of the insurance policy.    19.   The Allahabad High Court in The Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. v.    6 2015 SCC OnLine 6758 : (2015) 2 TAC 52                                                                         13 Manoj Kumar & Ors.7 again dealt with the case of an expired driving  licence. The endeavour to rely on the principle set forth in a fake licence  case was held not applicable in the case of an expired licence since the  owner was supposed to be aware that the driving licence of the driver had  expired and, thus, it was held that it was the duty of the owner to have  ensured that the driver gets the licence renewed within time. In the  absence of a valid driving licence, the vehicle was being driven in breach  of the condition of the policy, requiring the vehicle to be driven by a  person who is duly licensed, and thus, there was breach of Section 149(2)  (a)(ii) of the MV Act, the consequence being that the insurance company  could not he held liable.    20.   The last judgment is of the Himachal Pradesh High Court in  National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Hem Raj & Ors. 8 This was, once again,  a case of an originally valid licence, which had expired, there was no  question of a fake licence. It was opined that the conclusions to be drawn  from the observations of the judgment in the Swaran Singh9 case of this  Court, were that the insurance company can defend an action on the  7 (2015) 111 ALR 275 (authored by Krishna Murari, J., as he then was) 8 : 2012 ACJ 1891 (authored by Deepak Gupta, J., as he then was) 9 (supra)                                                                          14 ground that the driver was not duly licensed on the date of the accident,  i.e., an expired licence having not been renewed within thirty (30) days  of the expiry of the licence as provided in Sections 14 & 15 of the MV  Act. In this context it was observed that the Swaran Singh.10 case did not  deal with the consequences if the licence is not renewed within the period  of thirty (30) days. If the driving licence is not renewed within thirty  (30) days, it was held, the driver neither had an effective driving licence  nor can he said to be duly licenced. The conclusion, thus, was that the  driver, who permits his licence to expire and does not get it renewed till  after the accident, cannot claim that it should be deemed that the licence  is renewed retrospectively.   21.   The learned Judge debated the question of the consequences of the  MV Act being a beneficial piece of legislation.             Thus, if two  interpretations were possible, it was opined that the one which is in  favour of the claimants should be given, but violence should not be done  to the clear and plain language of the statute. Thus, while protecting the  rights of the claimants by asking the insurance company to deposit the  amount, the recovery of the same from the insured would follow as the  10 (supra)                                                                          15 sympathy can only be for the victim of the accident. The right which has  to be protected, is of the victim and not the owner of the vehicle. It was,  thus, observed in para 18 as under:        “18. When an employer employees a driver, it is his duty to check       that the driver is duly licensed to drive the vehicle. Section- 5 of       the Motor Vehicles Act provides that no owner or person incharge       of a motor vehicle shall cause or permit any person to drive the       vehicle if he does not fulfil the requirements of Sections 3 and 4 of       the Motor Vehicles Act. The owner must show that he has verified       the licence. He must also take reasonable care to see that his       employee gets his licence renewed within time. In my opinion, it is       no defence for the owner to plead that he forgot that the driving       licence of his employee had to be renewed. A person when he       hands his motor vehicle to a driver owes some responsibility to       society at large. Lives of innocent people are put to risk in case the       vehicle is handed over to a person not duly licensed. Therefore,       there must be some evidence to show that the owner had either       checked the driving licence or had given instructions to his driver       to get his driving licence renewed on expiry thereof. In the present       case, no such evidence has been led. In view of the above       discussion, I am clearly of the view that there was a breach of the       terms of the policy and the Insurance Company could not have       been held liable to satisfy the claim.”    22.   We have reproduced the aforesaid observations as it is our view  that it sets forth lucidly the correct legal position and we are in complete  agreement with the views taken in all the three judgments of three                                                                            16 different High Courts with the culmination being the elucidation of the  correct legal principle in the judgment in the Hem Raj11 case.   23.   When we turn to the facts of the present case there is almost an  identical situation where the appellant has permitted to let the first  respondent driver drive the truck with an expired licence for almost three  (3) years. It is clearly a case of lack of reasonable care to see that the  employee gets his licence renewed, further, if the original licence is  verified, certainly the employer would know when the licence expires.  And here it was a commercial vehicle being a truck. The appellant has  to, thus, bear responsibility and consequent liability of permitting the  driver to drive with an expired licence over a period of three (3) years.  The only thing we note is that fortunately there has been no accident with  a third party claimant but the person who has caused the sufferance and  sufferer are one and the same person, i.e., the first respondent driver. We  are, however, dealing with the determination under the Compensation Act  and those provisions are for the benefit of the workmen like the first  respondent, even though he may be at fault, by determining a small  amount payable to provide succor at the relevant stage when the larger  11 (supra)                                                                          17 issues could be debated in other proceedings.        The only exception is in the provisos to Section 3 of the  Compensation Act, which is not the factual situation in the present case.  The relevant provision reads as under:        “3. Employer' s liability for compensation.-        (1) If personal injury is caused to a workman by accident arising       out of and in the course of his employment, his employer shall be       liable to pay compensation in accordance with the provisions of       this Chapter:        Provided that the employer shall not be so liable--        (a) in respect of any injury which does not result in the total or       partial disablement of the workman for a period exceeding [four]       days;        (b) in respect of any [injury, not resulting in death, caused by] an       accident which is directly attributable to--              (i) the workman having been at the time thereof under the             influence of drink or drugs, or              (ii) the wilful disobedience of the workman to an order             expressly given, or to a rule expressly framed, for the             purpose of securing the safety of workmen, or              (iii) the wilful removal or disregard by the workman of any             safety guard or other device which he knew to have been             provided for the purpose of securing the safety of             workmen.”         We are not aware whether any other proceedings have been                                                                        18 initiated or not, at least, none that have been brought to our notice. The  aforesaid findings of the initial lack of care by the first respondent in not  renewing the driving licence would be present, but the lack of care of the  appellant as the employer would also arise. We have penned down the  aforesaid views as such a situation is quite likely to arise in proceedings  under the MV Act where a third party is claiming the amount.  Proceedings here being under the Compensation Act, the consequences  are not flowing to the first respondent as the initial negligent person.   24.   In view of the aforesaid, the appeals are dismissed by settling the  aforesaid question of law and leaving the parties to bear their own costs.                                                ...……………………………J.

The appeal is directed against the Order of the High          Court setting aside the Order passed by the Magistrate           allowing        the   application   filed   by   the   appellant   to           discharge him.           2. The charge-sheet came to be filed on the basis of a FIR          dated 01.10.2011. The appellant was Director of Mines and           Geology in the State of Karnataka at the relevant time. Signature Not Verified            There was a partnership firm by the name M/s Associated Digitally signed by ANITA MALHOTRA Date: 2020.01.07 17:53:29 IST Reason:                                                  1 Mineral Company (‘AMC’, for short). The offences are  alleged to revolve around the affairs of the said firm.  First accused is the husband of the second accused. They  became partners of the firm (AMC) in 2009. Appellant was  arrayed as the third accused. There was reference in the  charge-sheet to a conspiracy between the first accused and  the second accused. It is alleged, inter alia, that they  obtained an undated letter from one Shri K.M. Vishwanath,  the Ex-Partner, which is after his retirement with effect  from 01.08.2009 from the firm, which was addressed to the  appellant, seeking directions to the Deputy Director of  Mines and Geology, Hospet in Karnataka to issue the Mineral  Dispatch Permit (‘MDP’ for short) to the new partners, viz.,  the first accused and the second accused. It is further  averred that the investigation revealed that the appellant  marked the said letter to the Case Worker who put up the  note seeking orders for referring the matter for legal  opinion which was also approved and recommended by the  Additional Director and put up to the appellant for orders.  Appellant is alleged to have acted in pursuance to the                                2 criminal conspiracy and abused his official position with  a   dishonest    and   fraudulent   intention   to   cheat   the  Government of Karnataka and knowingly made a false note in  the file that he had discussed this matter with the Deputy  Director (Legal) and directed Deputy Director, Mines and  Geology, Hospet for issue of MDPs to the new partners, viz.,  the first accused and the second accused by violating Mines  and   Minerals   (Development   and   Regulation)    Act,    1957  (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Act’, for short) and  Mineral Concession Rules, 1960 (hereinafter referred to as  ‘the Rules’, for short). There are various allegations  regarding other accused. As far as appellant is concerned,  it is alleged further in the charge-sheet that the acts of  the accused, seven in number, including the third accused  (appellant),     constitutes criminal offences punishable  under Sections 120B, 420, 379, 409, 447, 468, 471, 477A of  the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the  IPC’, for short) and Sections 13(2) and 13(1)(c) and  13(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. No  doubt, the origin of this investigation is to be traced to                                   3 an Order passed by this Court dated 29.03.2011 in Special  Leave Petition (Criminal) No. 7366-7367 of 2010 and  connected   matters   ordering   investigation   into   the  illegalities into the matter of Mining Lease No. 2434 of  AMC. The allegations include the allegation that the  accused conspired to commit theft of Government property,  i.e., mineral ore. They allegedly trespassed into the  forest area and other areas of Bellary District: carried  out illegal mining and transported it. Though, second  accused (A2) to seventh accused(A7) filed applications  under Section 227 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973  (hereinafter referred to as ‘Cr.PC’, for short) seeking  discharge, by Order dated 08.10.2015, the Trial Court  discharged the second accused and the appellant. It is this  Order which has been set aside by the High Court by the  impugned Order.  APPLICATION BY THE APPELLANT SEEKING DISCHARGE  3. It is, inter alia, stated as follows:          Appellant is known for his honesty and dignity as      a public servant. He earned his name as an excellent                               4 and honest Officer in all the places where he was  posted. He was not issued a single article of charges  while discharging his duties. Though, he started as a  Member of the Karnataka State Civil Service, he  was promoted to the Cadre of Indian Administrative  Service (IAS) as he had an impeccable service record.  He was posted as Director of Mines in Geology, having  regard to his    service record. By         virtue   of the  delegation   under   Section   26(2)   of   the   Act,   the  execution of the lease deed lies with the Director of  Mines and Geology. AMC was granted the Mining Lease by  the State way back in 1966. The firm was reconstituted  several times by inducting new partners and retiring  old partners. As and when there is the reconstitution  of the firm, the firm intimated to the Department of  Geology of the reconstitution and conducted the mining  operation in the name of AMC by the newly inducted  partners. Though, several reconstitutions have taken  place, no application has been filed under Rule 37 of  the Rules for transfer of the lease on the ground that                            5 the assets, viz., the Mining Lease belongs to the firm  and not to any individual partners. Therefore, there  was no requirement of making an application under Rule  37 of the Rules seeking transfer of the Mining Lease.  Records produced by the official before the Court  reveal     that   the   Department   has   understood     that  reconstitution did not amount to transfer as the  partnership is the owner of the asset, viz., the Mining  Lease. On inducting first and second accused, the  reconstituted firm made application to Deputy Director  seeking MDP by intimating that two new partners were  inducted. The application was sent to the Director for  issuance of MDP. In addition to the application filed  to   the   Deputy   Director    seeking    MDPs,   Shri   K.M.  Vishwanath, Ex-Partner, representing the firm, made  application to the Director, placing on record that  firm had been reconstituted by inducting the first and  the second accused and, accordingly, intimated under  Rule 62 of the Rules. It is stated further that after  receiving the application by the Department, the file                               6 will have to be processed in the Mining Lease Section.  There      is   an   elaborate        procedure    followed        while  considering applications in Department of Mines and  Geology. The Section Officer initially examines the  file. A detailed note on the application is prepared.  The file, along with note sheet, is sent to the  Superintendent of the Mining Leases Section who is a  senior Officer who examines the note sheet and puts up  the     same    before     the       Additional        Director.    The  Additional       Director,           who   is     the     senior-most  departmental Officer in the Department, examines the  entire file and puts up the file before the Director.  He passes an order considering the law applicable. If  it    is   within    the   jurisdiction,          he    disposes     the  application. If an order from the State Government is  required, it is so referred with comments. The Director  signs the lease deed by virtue of delegation under  Section 26(2) of the Act.                                      7 4. Appellant found that the firm was constituted by Shri Jali Mahadevappa an Shri Jali Mallikarjun in the year 1966  and the lease was obtained in the name of AMC as a firm  registered under the Partnership Act. The lease, as per the  records, is the asset of the firm. The firm, viz., AMC, was  reconstituted on 30.06.1983 by inducting Shri L. Lingaraju  as one of the partners on account of retirement of Shri J.  Mallikarjun. On 13.02.1984, the firm was reconstituted  again wherein Shri B. Ananda joined as a partner and Shri  J. Lingaraju retired. On 13.02.1982, Smt. B. Vasanthi  joined in place of Shri J. Vamadevappa who retired from the  firm. On 13.06.1986, Shri B. Vasudev entered the firm as  a partner and Smt. B. Vasanthi retired from the firm. By  Deed of Partnership dated 10.06.1990, Shri Mohammed Kasim  joined the firm and Shri B. Ananda retired from the firm.  Again, Smt. Asha Mohammad Haroon joined as partner in place  of Shri B. Vasudev who retired. Again, AMC was reconstituted  by inducting Shri K.M. Prabhu and Smt. Parvathamma. There  was further reconstitution by inducting Smt. Sujata Prabhu  and Shri K.M. Sujan, as partners. Lastly, on 01.09.2009,                                8 the first accused and the second accused were inducted as  partners. From 1981, on several occasions, the firm was,  thus, reconstituted and the application under Rule 37 of  the Rules was not filed before the State Government.  Partners filed Form V before the Registrar of Firms  intimating reconstitution. Never was an application made  under Rule 37 as and when reconstitution was done on the  ground that the firm was the owner of the mining lease. Only  intimation under Rule 62 of the Rules was given. The Case  Worker-CW24 has suggested to take legal opinion which was  put up along with the note sheet. There was no note put up  suggesting the applicability of Rule 37 of the Rules. If  there was a suggestion about the applicability of such Rule,  the appellant would have taken appropriate decision. The  precedent available also was relied upon. The decision  taken was a bonafide decision. The suggestion to take legal  opinion was endorsed by the Additional Director which is  produced before the Court as Exhibit D-765, the note sheet.  During the course of the examination of the file, it was  brought to the notice of the appellant that Rule 37 was not                                9 applicable.   A   communication        was   sent   to   the   Deputy  Director, Hospet that the permits will have to be issued  to the AMC but not in the names of the partners. The  appellant further submitted that after receipt of the file,  he contacted the Deputy Director (Legal) telephonically who  informed that the reconstitution of the firm had taken place  by inducting new partners and permits may be issued in the  name of the Company and not in the name of the partners which  was denied by the said Deputy Director (Legal) at a later  stage. He sought support of Section 27 of the Act which  protected acts done in good faith under the Act. He pointed  out that during the investigation, he gave details of  various firms who have leases with the Government which have  not obtained permission under Rule 37. The procedure which  was consistently followed for obtaining MDPs by intimating  reconstitution under Rule 62 was brought to the notice. It  was   contended   that   taking    a    bonafide    administrative  decision on the understanding of Rule 37 and based on  previous precedents, should not be considered as cheating.  Reading of the charge-sheet and allegations, according to                                 10 the appellant, basically surrounded around Section 420 of  the IPC.  5. The statements of CW7, CW21, CW24, CW26, CW202 and CW109 were enlisted by the prosecution in support of the  charge. The appellant pointed out the statements of the  witnesses and the documents produced clearly reveal there  is no material much less prima facie material to frame the  charges.  ORDER PASSED BY THE MAGISTRATE  6. The Court noted the submission of the appellant that AMC had been reconstituted on a number of occasions. No  fault was found in accepting reconstitution. Only when the  first and second accused became partners in the year 2009,  the appellant was faulted. Reliance is seen placed on the  judgment of the judgment of the Division Bench of the High  Court in Sree Ramakrishna Mining Company v. Commissioner  of Income-Tax, Mysore1. Thereafter, reliance is placed on  decisions which were rendered under the Indian Stamp Act,   1   1966 SCC Online Kar 73 / ILR 1966 Mys. 1945                                    11 1899 for the proposition that an instrument evidencing the  distribution of assets of a firm, on dissolution or  retirement of a partner, would not amount to a conveyance.  The principles relating to discharge under Sections 227 and  228 were discussed, and finally, it was held as follows:                 “41.In view of the above said citations,          it is evident that act of A-3 in directing his          subordinates to issue MOP to M/s. Associated          Mining Company belonging to accused Nos.1 and          2 does not amount to fastening criminal          liability of him. In the statement of CWs          7,21,24,26,109 and 202, absolutely there is          no material to show that A-3 has committed          criminal conspiracy to help accused Nos.1 and          2 in directing his officials to issue Mineral          Dispatch Permit and as such there is          considerable force in the argument of learned          Counsel for accused No.3 and I am unable to          accept the argument addressed by learned          Special Public Prosecutor. Hence, I answer          IA. No.30 deserves to be allowed. I answer.”     FINDINGS OF THE HIGH COURT  7. After noting the rival contentions, the court notes that for punishing under Section 120B of the IPC, the  prosecution is required to prove the conspiracy. The                                12 agreement, which is illegal, can be proved by necessary  implication. It is to be largely proved from the inference  of the illegal acts or omissions by the conspirators. The  incriminating evidence collected by the prosecution, it is  noted, is that the appellant recommended issuance of MDPs  in gross violation of the Act despite the office noting to  the effect that the matter required legal opinion. The stand  of the appellant that he had discussed the matter with the  Legal Department is seen negatived by CW21. As to his  contention that many a time AMC was reconstituted and he  had really discussed the matter with CW21 before directing  the issue of MDPs, was found to be a matter of defence which  could not be pressed at the threshold.  8. We notice the following findings:          “12.     Applying the formulae of (some/mere                   suspicion – grave suspicion: as                   enunciated in Dilawar Balu Kurane’s                   case (supra) and Union of India -vs-                   Prafulla Kumar Samai and another                   reported in AIR 1979 SC 366, to the                   evidentiary material placed before                   the court against respondent, then                   also the needle tilts more towards                   grove suspicion. The subject matter                   involved in this case is the natural                               13                  resource of the country and the                  alleged offence is said to have                  caused loss to the State exchequer                  substantially. The respondent is a                  responsible officer of the State.                 Consciously he passed the order in                  violation    of   the    statutory                  provisions.          13.      The learned Trial Judge in the order                  impugned has made an omnibus                  observation that his action does                  not fasten criminal liability on                  him and the statement of the                  witnesses does not show that he                  committed    criminal   conspiracy.                  Though    there   was   no    direct                  evidence, the learned Trial Judge                  has lost sight of incriminating                  material     appearing     in    the                  circumstantial evidence placed by                  the prosecution. Limited power                  vested with the Trial Court to sift                  and    weigh    the   evidence    is                  transgressed by the learned Trial                  Judge in the impugned order, hence                  requires intervention in this                  revision jurisdiction.”   9. Accordingly, the petition was allowed setting aside the order of the Sessions Judge discharging the appellant.   10. We heard Shri Kapil Sibal, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellant. We also heard learned Counsel  appearing for the respondent.                             14 11. Shri Kapil Sibal, learned Senior Counsel for the appellant, submits as follows:                  The lease was originally in favour of AMC in           the    year   1966.   Thereafter,   the   firm   was           reconstituted on a large number of occasions. The           procedure followed was intimation being given to           the Department under Rule 62 of the Rules about the           reconstitution. Rule 37 of the Rules was not           invoked. This is a case where the action of the           appellant was bonafide. Proceeding on the basis           that Rule 37 applies, he further submits, this is           not a case where the appellant could be prosecuted           for the criminal offences. The appellant acted on           the basis of the practice. He contacted the Deputy           Director (Legal).    12. There is also case of the appellant that he had directed MDP to be issued in the name of the firm. He had also made  it clear that permit be also not issued to the partners.  There was no other material produced on record by the                                 15 prosecution. This is not a case where there is material to  establish any criminal conspiracy.   13. Per       contra,     the    learned    Counsel    for    the  respondent-Central Bureau of Investigation, Bengaluru,  supported the order. In particular, reliance is placed on  the specific stand of the Charge Witness-CW21 to the effect  that the appellant had not sought his legal opinion contrary  to the stand of the appellant.   LEGAL PRINCIPLES APPLICABLE IN REGARD TO AN APPLICATION SEEKING DISCHARGE  14. This is an area covered by a large body of case law. We refer to a recent judgment which has referred to the  earlier decisions, viz., P. Vijayan v. State of Kerala and  another2 and discern the following principles:      i. If two views are possible and one of them gives rise           to   suspicion   only   as   distinguished   from   grave           suspicion, the Trial Judge would be empowered to           discharge the accused.   2   (2010) 2 SCC 398                                    16 ii. The Trial Judge is not a mere Post Office to frame      the charge at the instance of the prosecution.  iii. The Judge has merely to sift the evidence in order      to find out whether or not there is sufficient ground      for   proceeding.   Evidence   would     consist    of   the      statements recorded by the Police or the documents      produced before the Court.  iv. If the evidence, which the Prosecutor proposes to      adduce to prove the guilt of the accused, even if      fully   accepted    before     it   is    challenged     in      cross-examination    or    rebutted      by   the   defence      evidence, if any, “cannot show that the accused      committed offence, then, there will be no sufficient      ground for proceeding with the trial”.  v. It is open to the accused to explain away the materials      giving rise to the grave suspicion.  vi. The court has to consider the broad probabilities,      the total effect of the evidence and the documents      produced before the court, any basic infirmities      appearing in the case and so on. This, however, would                             17          not entitle the court to make a roving inquiry into           the pros and cons.      vii. At the time of framing of the charges, the probative           value of the material on record cannot be gone into,           and   the     material   brought   on   record   by   the           prosecution, has to be accepted as true.      viii. There must exist some materials for entertaining           the strong suspicion which can form the basis for           drawing up a charge and refusing to discharge the           accused.    15. The defence of the accused is not to be looked into at the stage when the accused seeks to be discharged under  Section 227 of the Cr.PC (See State of J & K v. Sudershan  Chakkar and another3). The expression, “the record of the  case”, used in Section 227 of the Cr.PC, is to be understood  as the documents and the articles, if any, produced by the  prosecution. The Code does not give any right to the accused  to produce any document at the stage of framing of the   3   AIR 1995 SC 1954                                    18 charge. At the stage of framing of the charge, the  submission of the accused is to be confined to the material  produced by the Police (See State of Orissa v. Debendra Nath  Padhi4).   ANALYSIS OF THE CASE  16. Having set out the legal principles, as aforesaid, let us consider the facts:                   Undoubtedly,   the   appellant   came   to   be              appointed as the Director of Mines and Geology of              the State of Karnataka by virtue of Notification              dated 09.06.2008. He continued in the said post              till 25.10.2010. Mining Lease No.625 was executed              on 02.03.1966 between the Governor and AMC, a              registered firm. The Managing Partner was one Shri              Jali Mahadevappa. The partners of the AMC, viz.,              Shri K.M. Parvatamma and Shri K.M. Vishwanath sent              a letter dated 26.12.2009. It reads as follows:                    “To:                  The Director 4   AIR 2005 SC 359                                  19 Mines & Geology Mineral Khanija Bhavan Race Course Road Bangalore.  Sub: Change    in    Constitution    of      Associated   Mining   Company   ML      No.2434- Reg.  Sir,      We undersigned are lease owner of Associated Mining Company of Guru Iron Ore Mines at Venkatagiri Village, Sandur Taluk, Bellary Dist, bearing ML No.2434 (Old 625).      For better management we admitted as Partners Mr. G. Janardhan Reddy and Mrs. G. Lakshmi Aruna of 123/350 Veerabagouda Colony, Opp Kumaraswamy Temple Club Road, Bellary on 31st July, 2009. Subsequently on 1st August, 2009 Smt. K.M. Parvatamma and Mr. K.M. Vishwanath retired.      Mr. G. Janardhana Reddy and Mrs. G. Lakshmi Aruna are sole Partners of the Mine. The admission and Retirement deed are enclosed herewith for your perusal. This is for your kind information.      Kindly    issue    permission    to transport the ore from Mines to various destinations.      Thanking you,  Yours sincerely,  sd/- Smt. K. Parvatamma  sd/- Mr.K.M. Vishwanath”                20 17. The role, which is attributed to the appellant, begins essentially with this letter. It is the case of the  prosecution that having regard to Rule 37 of the Rules, it  was incumbent upon the appellant, before acting upon the  reconstitution of the firm, to obtain the previous sanction  of   the   State   Government.   The   Charge   Witnesse-CW24-  D. Hanumantha, undoubtedly, has given statement indicating  that the letter aforesaid was marked to him to process the  same. He further stated that he proposed that legal opinion  may be obtained. Finally, it was submitted to the Additional  Director.    The Additional Director also recommended the  need to obtain legal opinion. The matter came up before the  appellant on 04.01.2010. On 04.01.2010, it appears that  appellant has ordered:                   “… “spoken to Dy. Director (Legal), the            company remains the same, whereas the            partners might have been included or removed,            and this they are supposed to approach the law            board. In the present case, the partners are            not asking for MDP (Mineral Dispatch Permits)            in their names, but in the name of the            company. Permits may be issued only in the                                 21          name of the company viz., AMC where lease is          also sanctioned to the same company only. The          partners are changed, but you are not going          to issue MDPs to the partners. Hence inform          DD Hospet that MDPs may be issued only in the          name of the Company.”…”   18. The Additional Director has also spoken on similar lines.  19. The case of the prosecution, which has appealed to the High Court, is essentially based on the fact that on the  one hand, the appellant in his Order dated 04.01.2010  (Draft) which was finalised on 05.01.2010, spoke about  having obtained legal opinion by speaking to Deputy  Director (Legal), the Deputy Director (Legal) has taken the  stand that he has not given any such opinion. The statement  of the Deputy Director (Legal) has been produced by the  appellant along with Criminal Miscellaneous Petition No.  122009 of 2009. He has stated, inter alia, as follows:                “However, no opinion was sought from me in           this regard”. He has further stated that since the           contents of the letter dated 26.12.2009 disclosed                                22 that   the   entire    lease   holding   rights   were  transferred in favour of the first and second  accused, it is contrary to Rule 37 of the Rules.  However, ignoring the provisions of Rule 37, the  direction was issued to Deputy Director to issue  the MDPs in the name of the Company. However, he  further states that AMC is a firm not a company.  He further stated that if there is no change in the  rights of the lessee, then, someone else gets  rights over the leasehold rights. The said act will  attract provisions of Rule 37 of the Rules. He has  also stated that though an application was filed  on 29.07.1994 in view of the fact that the Mining  Lease was due to expire on 01.03.1996, the lease  is renewed from the year 2000 to 2010 by the  Minister     since    the   Forest   Department   gave  permission. He goes on to state that the lease  ought to have been renewed with effect from  02.03.1996 for a period of ten years.                           23 20. It is necessary to notice Rule 37 of the Rules which were made in 1960. Rule 37 reads as follows, inter alia:            “37. Transfer of lease :- (1) The lessee shall          not, without the previous consent in writing          of the State Government and in the case of          mining lease in respect of any mineral          specified in Part ‘A’ and Part ‘B’ of the          First   Schedule    to   the   Act,    without          the previous approval of the Central          Government :-               (a) assign, sublet, mortgage, or in any                   other manner, transfer the mining                   lease, or any right, title or                   interest therein, or               (b) enter into or make any bonafide                   arrangement,       contract,       or                   understanding whereby the lessee                   will or may be directly or                   indirectly      financed     to     a                   substantial extent by, or under                   which the lessee's operations or                   undertakings    will    or   may   be                   substantially controlled by, any                   person or body of persons other than                   the lessee:”                                   (Emphasis supplied)   21. The Trial Court has placed reliance on judgment of the Division Bench of the Mysore High Court in Sree Ramakrishna  Mining Company (supra). In fact, the Court in the said case,                                 24 considered Rule 37 of the Mineral Concession Rules of 1949,  which read as follows:                “37. Transfer of lease:- The lessee may          with the previous sanction of the State          Government   and   subject   to conditions          specified in the first proviso to rule 35 and          in rule 38, transfer his lease or any right,          title, or interest therein, to a person          holding a certificate of approval on payment          of a fee of Rs.100 to the State Government.”                                   (Emphasis supplied)   22. It is clear that the provision, as obtained prior to 1960, when the Rules were made, was different.  23. In the aforesaid case, the question came to be decided in a Reference under Section 66 of the Income Tax Act, 1922.  One of the questions which fell for decision was the effect  of there being no previous sanction of the Government under  Rule 37 for the transfer of lease. We may notice that the  Court in Sree Ramakrishna Mining Company (supra), inter  alia, held as follows:               “The 37th Rule, as can be seen from its          language does not concern itself with the          formation of a partnership such as the one          before us, and, its principal purpose is to          provide for the transfer of a lease granted          under the provisions of the Rules. It is in                               25          the nature of an enabling provision which          authorises a transfer by the lessee to a          person who has a certificate of approval,          and, directs that such transfer could be made          with the previous sanction of the Government          subject to the other conditions with which we          are not concerned. There is a distinction          between a statutory provision which contains          an   express    prohibition    against    the          performance of a certain act and one which          enables    its   performance    subject    to          prescribed conditions. While in the former          case, there will be no difficulty in coming          to the conclusion if nothing else could be          said about it that the absolute prohibition          against the performance of the act is what is          forbidden by law, the same could not be said          if the matter falls within the second          category. Now the 37th rule does not, in          express terms, forbid a transfer but          authorises a transfer with the previous          sanction of the Government and subject to          other conditions.”  24. The provisions of Rule 37, which would control destiny of this case, is, as it was obtained in the year 2009. Also  could it not be contended that decisions rendered under the  Stamp Act may not be relevant to understood the scope of  Rule (37) of the Rules. No doubt, there is a case for the  appellant that on a number of reconstitutions took place  in regard to the firm-AMC, and on no occasion, was an issue  relating to infraction of Rule 37, raised. All that the                               26 appellant did was, he acted in accordance with the practice  obtaining in the Department. There is the case for the  appellant that in this regard, Rule 37, as such, was not  pointedly invoked by either the Additional Director or the  SDA.  25. It is here that again it becomes necessary that we remind ourselves of the contours of the jurisdiction under  Section 227 of the Cr.PC. The principle established is to  take the materials prod"

For       deciding    these     two      appeals     it   is  sufficient to notice the facts in CA No.11923 of  2018 for Assessment Year 1999­2000. The High Court  by the impugned judgment has affirmed the views of  Income    Tax    Appellate        Tribunal       on   the   questions  which     have    been        raised   in    this       appeal.        The  Assessing Officer as well as the Commissioner of  Income Tax (Appeals) has not accepted the claim of  the appellant. The appellant (hereinafter referred  to as the “assessee”) is engaged in the business of  manufacturing automobiles, which are chargeable to  Excise Duty under the Central Excise Act, 1994. The  assessment       year    in    question     is     assessment      year  1999­2000.       The    assessee,      a     Company,       has    been  engaged in manufacturing and sale of various Maruti  Cars and also trades in spares and components of  the vehicles. It acquires exiceable raw materials  and inputs which are used in the manufacturing of  the vehicles. The assessee had also been taking                                                                          3  benefit of MODVAT credit on the raw material and  inputs used in the manufacturing. At the end of the  Assessment           year      1999­2000          an      amount        of  Rs.69,93,00,428/­           was    left    as    unutilised       MODVAT  credit.       In    the   return    it     was   claimed        that   the  Company was eligible for deduction under Section  43B     of    the     Income      Tax     Act    as     an    allowable  deduction. Similarly, the Company claimed deduction  under Section 43B of an amount of Rs. 3,08,88,171/­  in respect of Sales Tax Recoverable Account.   2.    The Assessing Officer passed assessment order  dated 28.03.2002. The Assessing Officer disallowed  the claim of deduction of Rs.69,93,00,428/­ as well  as Rs.3,08,99,171/­. Aggrieved by the assessment  order,       the   assessee       filed    an    appeal      before    the  Commissioner         of Income      Tax. The Commissioner               of  Income Tax also sustained the disallowance of the  above two items. An appeal to ITAT met the same  fate.    The       ITAT   took    the     view   that     the    advance                                                     4  payment of Excise Duty which represented unutilised  MODVAT credit without incurring the liability of  such payment is not an allowable deduction under  Section 43B.    The assessee filed an appeal under  Section 260A of the Income Tax Act in the High  Court. The High Court answered question Nos.(ii)  and ((iii) relating to the above noted disallowance  in favour of the Revenue. Aggrieved by the judgment  of the High Court, these appeals have been filed.   3.   The two questions which were answered by the  High Court in favour of the Revenue which were  subject matter of this appeal are question Nos.(ii)  and (iii) as framed by the High Court are to the  following effect:       ""(ii) Whether the ITAT had committed an      error   of    law    in    upholding    the      disallowance    of     the     amount    of      Rs.69,93,00,428/­     which     represented      MODVAT   credit   of   Excise   Duty   that                                  st      remained unutilised by 31      March, 1999      i.e. the end of the relevant accounting      year ?       (iii) Whether the ITAT has committed an                                                                 5       error    of    law    in    upholding   the      disallowance    of    Rs.3,08,99,171/­   in      respect    of    Sales    Tax   Recoverable      Account,    under   Section   43B   of  the      Income­tax Act ?”     4.   We have heard Shri S. Ganesh, learned senior  counsel for the appellant­assessee and Shri Arijit  Prasad, learned senior counsel for the Revenue.   5.   Shri Ganesh submits that the amount paid by  way of Excise Duty by the assessee to its suppliers  of raw materials and inputs, is accepted as Excise  Duty under the provisions of Central Excise Act and  Rules.   Consequently,       when   the   said     payments are  made by the assessee to its suppliers, they should  be   treated   as     payments      of    Excise    Duty    which  straightaway qualify for deduction under Section  43B of the Income Tax Act, irrespective of whether  or   when   the     MODVAT    credit      arising    from   such  payments is utilised to make payment of Excise Duty  on the products manufactured by the assessee. The                                                      6  High Court erroneously held that the above payments  made by the assessee are mere contractual payments  and not payments by way of Excise Duty. As soon as  the raw materials and inputs are received in the  appellant's factory, the assessee becomes entitled  to avail of MODVAT credit in respect of Excise Duty  paid on the raw materials and inputs and which is  mentioned in the manufacturer­supplier's invoice.  The assessee was clearly entitled for deduction of  unutilised MODVAT credit balance as on 31.03.1999.   6.   Shri   Ganesh   in   alternative   submits   that  questions are squarely covered in favour of the  assessee by the 1st proviso to Section 43B. The  assessee's Excise Returns establish that while the  untilised MODVAT credit as on 31.03.1999 was Rs.  69.30 crores, the entire amount was utilised in  April, 1999 itself. Consequently, the assessee is  entitled to the deduction under the 1 st proviso to  Section 43B. The object and purpose of Section     43B                                                              7  of the Act is to ensure that an assessee does not  get deduction in respect of an amount unless and  until   the   amount    has    been       received   by    the  Government. In the present case the full amount of  Excise Duty was paid into the coffers of Government  when the manufacturer of raw material/inputs had  cleared the same from his factory           gate for supply  to the assessee. The basic object of Section 43B of  the Act is fully subserved and deduction should  have been granted as claimed by the assessee.   7.   Shri Arijit Prasad, learned senior counsel for  the Revenue refuting the submissions of the learned  counsel for the assessee contends that deduction  under Section 43B is allowable only when the amount  of   tax, cess   etc.   are   due   and    payable   and   the  assessee actually pays the same. In the present  case the Excise Duty becomes due and payable only  when the assessee removes the finished product from  the factory gate, at the point in time when the                                                                  8  assessee makes payment to the suppliers the Excise  Duty is not due and payable. It is not in dispute  that the assessee was entitled to the duty paid by  it to the manufacturer under Rule 57A to Rule 571  of the Central Excise Rules, 1944. Further it is  not in dispute that the assessee was entitled to  utilise MODVAT       credit    towards    payment     of    Excise  Duty leviable on the final products manufactured by  it. The liability under the Central Excise Act to  pay Excise Duty is only on the manufacture of the  excisable goods. The assessee is not one who is  liable    to     pay     Excise     Duty         on   the      raw  materials/inputs.      It     is merely    the    incidence     of  Excise Duty that has shifted from the manufacturer  to the purchaser and not the liability to pay the  same. Answering the submission of counsel for the  assessee based on proviso to Section 43B, it is  submitted that liability to pay Excise Duty of the  assessee is incurred on the removal of the finished  goods    in    the   subsequent     year,    therefore,        on                                                               9  31.03.1999, the assessee was not liable to pay the  Excise Duty and, therefore, the proviso will also  not come to the aid of the assessee.   8.   We    have   considered    the     submissions   of    the  learned counsel for the parties and perused the  records.   9.   The two issues which need to be answered by us  in these appeals are:       ""(i) Whether the ITAT had committed an      error   of    law    in    upholding    the      disallowance    of     the     amount    of      Rs.69,93,00,428/­     which     represented      MODVAT   credit   of   Excise   Duty   that                                  st      remained unutilised by 31      March, 1999      i.e. the end of the relevant accounting      year ?       (ii) Whether the ITAT has committed an      error    of    law    in    upholding   the      disallowance    of    Rs.3,08,99,171/­   in      respect    of    Sales    Tax   Recoverable      Account,    under   Section   43B   of  the      Income­tax Act ?”   10. We     need   to   first   notice    the   provisions   of  Section 43B under which deduction is sought to be                                                  10  claimed. Section 43B is as follows:        “43B.Certain deductions to be only on     actual   payment.­Notwithstanding anything     contained in any other provision of this     Act, a deduction otherwise allowable under     this Act in respect of—       (a) any sum payable by the assessee by way       of tax, duty, cess or fee, by whatever       name called, under any law for the time       being in force, or       (b)any sum payable by the assessee as an       employer by way of contribution to any       provident fund or superannuation fund or       gratuity fund or any other fund for the       welfare of employees, or       (c)any sum referred to in clause (ii) of       sub­section (1) of section 36, or       (d)any sum payable by the assessee as       interest on any loan or borrowing from       any public financial institution or a       State financial corporation or a State       industrial   investment corporation,  in       accordance with the terms and conditions       of the agreement governing such loan or       borrowing, or                                               11  (e) any sum payable by the assessee as   interest on any loan or advances from a   scheduled bank[or a co­operative bank   other than a primary agricultural credit   society   or    a   primary  co­operative   agricultural and rural development bank]   in   accordance   with   the  terms   and   conditions of the agreement governing   such loan or advances, or   (f)any sum payable by the assessee as an   employer in lieu of any leave at the   credit of his employee, or   (g)any sum payable by the assessee to the   Indian Railways for the use of railway   assets,   shall be allowed (irrespective of the previous year in which the liability to pay such sum was incurred by the assessee according to the method of accounting regularly   employed   by  him)   only   in computing the income referred to in Section 28 of that previous year in which such sum is actually paid by him :   Provided that nothing contained in this section shall apply in relation to any sum which is actually paid by the assessee on or before the due date applicable in his case for furnishing the return of income under sub­section (1) of section 139 in                                                               12        respect of the previous year in which the       liability to pay such sum was incurred as       aforesaid and the evidence of such payment       is furnished by the assessee along with       such return.                                                   ....”    11. The untilised MODVAT credit on 31.03.1999 to  the credit of the assessee was Rs.69,93,00,428/­.  The MODVAT credit was accumulated to the account of  the assessee due to payment of Excise Duty on raw  materials and inputs which were supplied to it by  the   suppliers   and    reflected     in   the   invoices   by  which raw materials and inputs were supplied. There  is no denial to the fact that the appellant was  entitled   to   utilise    this    credit    in   payment    of  Excise Duty to which the assessee was liable in  payment    of   Excise    Duty    on   manufacture    of     its  products. When we analyse provision of Section 43B  of the Act the provision indicates that deduction  thereunder is to be allowed on fulfilment of the  following conditions:                                                            13         ""a. there should be an actual payment of            Excise Duty whether “by way of tax,            duty, cess or fee, by whatever name”;          b.such payment has to be “under any law           for the time being in force”;          c.the payment of such sum should have           been made by the assessee;          d.irrespective   of   the   method  of           accounting regularly employed by the           assessee, deduction shall be allowed           while computing the income tax for           the previous year “in which sum is           actually paid” by the assessee;          e.the expression “any such sum payable”           refers to a sum for which the           assessee incurred liability in the           previous year even though such sum           might not have been payable within           that year under the relevant law.”    12. The      fulfillment    of    the     above     statutory  conditions    is   necessary     for    allowing    deduction  under Section 43B. We have to examine the facts of  the present case to find out as to whether all the  conditions    which   are   necessary      for    permissible  deduction under Section 43B are present here or  not.                                                               14     13. The crucial words in Section 43B(a) are “any  sum payable by the assessee by way of tax, duty,  cess or fee...”. We need to examine as to whether  unutilised      credit    under   MODVAT    Scheme   was    sum  payable by the assessee.   14. The Excise Duty is levied under the Central  Excise Act, 1944 and collected as per the Central  Excise Rules, 1944. The assessee in reference to  the   Central    Excise    Rules,    1944   is   Assessee    as  defined in Rule 2(3) which is to the following  effect:­              “Rule 2(3). “assessee” means        any   person  who  is  liable  for        payment of duty assessed and also        includes     any    producer    or        manufacturer of excisable goods or        a registered person of a private        warehouse in which excisable goods        are stored;”    15. The      taxable      event     is     manufacture      and                                                                              15  production of excisable articles and payment of  duty    is    relatable         to    date     of    removal      of      such  article from the factory. The manufacture of the  raw materials or inputs which have been used by  the appellant are the excisable items within the  meaning of Central Excise Rules, 1944. The Excise  Duty    is    leviable          on     the    manufacturer           of    raw  materials      and         inputs.       The        supplier         of    raw  materials or inputs includes the Excise Duty paid  on     such   articles          in     his     sale       invoices.        The  appellant when purchases raw materials and inputs  for     manufacture          of       vehicles       it     maintains        a  separate      account       containing         the       Excise   Duty     as  mentioned in sale invoices. The credit of such  Excise Duty paid by the appellant is to be given  to the appellant by virtue of Rule 57A to 57F of  Central Excise Rules, 1944 as it then existed. The  appellant      was        fully      entitled       to    discharge        his  liability       to        pay        Excise     Duty       on     vehicles  manufactured         by    adjusting         the    credit      of    Excise                                                                  16  Duty   earned     by   it   as     per    MODVAT   scheme.     The  liability to pay Excise Duty is not fastened on  two entities as per the scheme of Central Excise  Act    and      Central     Excise       Rules.    It    is    the  manufacturer of raw materials and inputs which are  used by appellant who has statutory liability to  pay Excise Duty. The appellant is not assessee  within the meaning of Central Excise Act, 1944,  with     reference     to    raw     materials     and     inputs  manufactured by the entities from which appellant  had purchased the raw materials and entities.   16. As    per    Section     43B(a)      of   Income     Tax   Act,  deduction is allowed on “any sum payable by the  assessee by way of tax, duty, cess or fee.” The  credit of Excise Duty earned by the appellant under  MODVAT scheme as per Central Excise Rules, 1944 is  not sum payable by the assessee by way of tax,  duty, cess. The scheme under Section 43B is to  allow deduction when a sum is payable by assessee                                                                     17  by way of tax, duty and cess and had been actually  paid by him.   17. Furthermore, the deductions under Section 43B  is allowable only when sum is actually paid by the  assessee.     In   the    present       case,    the    Excise    Duty  leviable on appellant on manufacture of vehicles  was already adjusted in the concerned assessment  year   from      the   credit      of   Excise    Duty    under    the  MODVAT scheme. The unutilised credit in the MODVAT  scheme cannot be treated as sum actually paid by  the appellant. The assessee when pays the cost of  raw materials where the duty is embedded, it does  not ipso facto mean that assessee is the one who is  liable      to     pay    Excise         Duty      on     such     raw  material/inputs.         It   is    merely       the    incident    of  Excise Duty that has shifted from the manufacturer  to the purchaser and not the liability to the same.   18. We thus, conclude that the unutilised credit  under MODVAT scheme does not qualify for deductions                                                                      18  under Section 43B of the Income Tax Act.   19. Shri       Ganesh   has    relied    on    judgment       of   this  Court    in    Eicher    Motors   Ltd.    and       another    versus  Union of India and others, (1999) 2 SCC 361, and  submits that facility of credit is as good as tax  paid, hence, it be accepted that by payment of  Excise Duty although which is part of sale invoice  issued by manufacturer or producer of raw material  or inputs, the payment by appellant was Excise Duty  which qualified for deduction under Section 43B.   20. In        Eicher    Motors    Ltd.        and    another,       the  challenge to the validity of scheme as modified by  introduction of Rule 57F of Central Excise Rules,  1944 was under consideration. According to Section  57­F(4A)       of   Central    Excise    Rules,       1944,    credit  which was lying unutilised on 16.03.1995 with the  manufacturers,         stood   lapsed,    Rule       57­F(4­A)      has  been extracted in paragraph 2 of the judgment which  is to the following effect: ­                                                 19            “2. The relevant Rule reads as       follows:           “57­F.    (4­A)   Notwithstanding       anything contained in sub­rule (4),       or sub­rule (1) of Rule 57­A and       the       notifications        issued       thereunder, any credit of specified       duty lying unutilised on the 16th       day   of    March,   1995    with   a       manufacturer of tractors, falling       under Heading No. 87.01 or motor       vehicles falling under Heading No.       87.02 and 87.04 [or chassis of such       tractors or such motor vehicles       under Heading No. 87.06] of the       Schedule to the Central Excise       Tariff Act, 1985 (5 of 1986) shall       lapse and shall not be allowed to       be utilised for payment of duty on       any    excisable    goods,    whether       cleared for home consumption or for       export:            Provided that nothing contained       in this sub­rule shall apply to       credit of duty, if any, in respect       of   inputs   lying  in   stock   or       contained   in   finished   products       lying in stock on the 16th day of       March, 1995.”   21. This Court in reference to 57­F(4­A) took the  view that right to credit had become absolute at  any rate when the input is used in the manufacture                                                                  20  of the final products. This court held that the  scheme    sought     to    be    introduced     cannot   be    made  applicable to the goods which had already come into  existence in respect of which the earlier Scheme  was applied. Following observations have been made  by   this    Court        in    paragraph   5    of   the     above  judgment:­                 “As pointed out by us that when          on   the   strength     of   the   Rules          available, certain acts have been          done    by  the    parties    concerned,          incidents    following    thereto   must          take place in accordance with the          Scheme under which the duty had been          paid on the manufactured products          and if such a situation is sought to          be altered, necessarily it follows          that the right, which had accrued to          a party such as the availability of          a   scheme,    is   affected   and,   in          particular, it loses sight of the          fact that the provision for facility          of credit is as good as tax paid          till tax is adjusted on future goods          on    the   basis    of    the   several          commitments which would have been          made by the assessees concerned.          Therefore, the Scheme sought to be          introduced cannot be made applicable          to the goods which had already come          into existence in respect of which                                                           21           the earlier Scheme was applied under          which the assessees had availed of          the credit facility for payment of          taxes. It is on the basis of the          earlier Scheme necessarily that the          taxes   have  to   be  adjusted  and          payment made complete. Any manner or          mode of application of the said Rule          would result in affecting the rights          of the assessees.”    22. The observations in the above paragraph that  facility of credit is as good as tax paid till tax  is adjusted on future goods were made in context of  57­F(4­A) of Central Excise Rules,1944.   23. The above observation cannot be read to mean  that payment of Excise Duty by the appellant which  was component of sale invoice purchasing the raw  material/inputs by the appellant is also payment of  Excise Duty on raw material/inputs.   24. By    payment   of   component   of   Excise   Duty   as  included in sale invoice is benefit which is given  to appellant by virtue of credit as envisaged in  statutory scheme of Rule 57­A to 57­I of Central                                                                   22  Excise Rules, 1944. The above judgment thus in no  manner supports the submissions of the appellant  for the purposes of the present case.   25. Next       judgment      relied    by     Shri     Ganesh     in  Collector      of     Central   Excise,       Pune    and   others  versus Dai Ichi Karkaria Ltd. and others; (1999) 7  SCC    448.      In    the   above    case,    this    Court     had  occasion to consider Section 4 of Central Excise  Act,   1944,    which     provides    for     valuation     of   raw  material      covered    by MODVAT     Scheme.       Referring    to  Rule 57­A(1)          and Rule 57­F(1), this Court laid  down following in paragraph 18, 19 and 20: ­                   “18. It is clear from these         rules, as we read them, that a         manufacturer obtains credit for the         Excise Duty paid on raw material to         be used by him in the production of         an excisable product immediately it         makes the requisite declaration and         obtains an acknowledgment thereof.         It is entitled to use the credit at         any time thereafter when making         payment of Excise Duty on the         excisable product...                                                        23              19. It is, therefore, that in         the case of Eicher Motors Ltd. vs.         Union of India, this Court said         that a credit under the MODVAT         Scheme was as good as tax paid.               20. With this in mind, we must         now determine whether the Excise         Duty paid on the raw material         should form part of the cost of the         excisable product for the purposes         of Section 4(1)(b) of the Act read         with   Rule  6   of  the   Valuation         Rules.”    26. In the above case, this Court held that in  determining   the   cost   of   the   excisable   product  covered by MODVAT Scheme under Section 4(1)(b) of  the Act read with Rule 6 of the Valuation Rules,  the Excise Duty paid on raw material covered by  MODVAT Scheme is not to be included. The question  which was answered in the above case was entirely  different to one which has arisen in the present  case.   27. This Court as noted above in the above case has  laid down that credit for the Excise Duty paid for                                                             24  the raw material      can   be used     at any time       when  making payment of Excise Duty on excisable product.  The user of such credit is at the time of payment  of Excise Duty on the excisable product i.e. at the  time when appellant is to pay Excise Duty on its  manufactured vehicle.   28. The judgment of this Court in Berger Paints  India Ltd. versus Commissioner of Income Tax, 2004  (266)   ITR   99,   has   also   been   referred   to.     The  assessee company in the above case had claimed that  under Section 43B of the Income Tax Act, it was  entitled to deduction of the entire sum being the  duties actually paid during the relevant previous  years. The appellant in the year in question had  incurred   expenditure      on   account   of   customs    and  Excise Duty aggregating to Rs.5,85,87,181/­ which  was duties debited to the profit and loss account  of the company for the relevant previous year. In  assessment proceedings the company’s claim that it                                                                      25  was     entitled       to    deduct       the     entire     sum     of  Rs.5,85,87,181/­        being      the    duties    actually       paid  during     the     relevant        year    was     accepted.        The  Commissioner of Income Tax initiated proceedings  under    Section       263    of    the     Act     claiming       that  Assessing officer had wrongly allowed the claim for  deduction.       The   Commissioner        held    that    assessing  officer incorrectly relied on judgment of Gujarat  High Court in Lakhan Pal National Ltd. versus ITO  (1986) 162 ITR 240, ITAT also. ITAT referred a  question to the High Court. The High Court answered  the question in favour of Revenue against which the  appeal    was    filed.      The   relevant       facts    have    been  noticed in the judgment of this Court in following  words: ­               “...In the assessment proceedings of         the    assessment   year   1984­85,    the         Inspecting Assistant Commissioner of         Income­tax    allowed    the   appellant­         assessee’s claim that it was entitled         to    deduct    the    entire    sum    of         Rs.5,85,87,181/­    being    the    duties         actually paid during the relevant year                                            26  previous to the assessment year 1984­ 85. The Commissioner of Income­tax initiated proceedings under section 263 of the Act on the ground that the Assessing Officer had wrongly allowed the claim for deduction of an amount of Rs.98,25,833/­   towards   customs   and Excise Duty paid during the previous year but credited to the profit and loss account in closing stock of goods under the provisions of Section 43B. the assessee relied upon the judgment of the Gujarat high Court in Lakhanpal National Ltd. Vs. ITO[1986] 162 ITR 240[hereinafter    referred     to    as “Lakhanpal National Ltd.’s case”] in support of its claim. The Commissioner of Income­tax took the view that the Gujarat   High  Court’s   decision   was distinguishable     on    facts     and, therefore, made an order under section 263 of the Act disallowing the claim of the   assessee.   On   appeal   to   the Tribunal, the Tribunal held that the Gujarat   high   court’s   judgment   in Lakhanpal National Ltd.’s case [1986] 162 ITR 240 was distinguishable and confirmed the order of the Commissioner of Income­tax. On an application made under section 256(1) of the Act at the instance of the appellant­assessee, the Tribunal, inter alia, referred the following question of law for the opinion of the High Court (see [2002] 253 IT 738, 739):          “Whether, on the facts and in      the circumstances of the case, the      Tribunal was right in law in                                                                 27                rejecting the assessee’s claim for               deduction   of    the  excise  and               customs duties of Rs.98,25,833               paid in the year of account and               debited in the profit and loss               account, on the ground that the               crediting of the profit and loss               account by     the value of the               closing stock, which included the               aforesaid duties, did not have the               effect of wiping out the debit to               the profit and loss account?”            The High Court by its judgment dated        September 24, 2001, in I.T.R.No.213 of        1993 (see [2002] 253 ITR 738), answered        the question referred in favour of the        Revenue and against the assessee.”     29. This      Court   in     Berger    Paints    Ltd.    (Supra)  upheld the view of assessing officer and decided  the question in favour of the assessee. This Cour"

Signature Not Verified                          The appellant joined the Central Industrial Security Force Digitally signed by SATISH KUMAR YADAV           (“CISF”) in January, 1995 as a Sub­Inspector. After completing Date: 2020.09.10 18:35:29 IST Reason:              requisite training in Hyderabad, he was allocated to Mumbai Office of                                                                                  Page | 1 the Western Zone and posted at the local unit of Bharat Petroleum  Corporation Ltd (“BPCL”) in March, 1996. Although he was initially  deputed to perform shift duty, but since July, 1997 he was deployed  in the Crime and Intelligence Wing. As evidenced by an office order  dated 08.05.1998, the appellant was specifically entrusted with  conducting surprise searches of personnel and taking strict action  against anyone indulging in corruption.   3.     On 28.02.1999 at around 6PM, Constable Ram Avtar Sharma  (CW­1; hereinafter “Sharma”) was commuting in a CISF bus near the  BPCL     compound   when    Inspector     Hiralal   Chaudhary    (PW­1;  hereinafter, “Chaudhary”) noticed a large bundle of high­denomination  notes in Sharma’s pocket. Suspicious, Chaudhary got the bus turned  back towards the BPCL compound, and forcibly made Sharma  deboard near the North­gate. Amidst witnesses, Chaudhary searched  Sharma’s person, during which a total sum of Rs 10,780 in the form of  100 notes of Rs 100 and the rest in smaller denominations was  recovered. No explanation for the large sum of unaccounted cash was  forthcoming from Sharma, except for a plea for mercy, post which the  amount was seized and the incident recorded in the General Diary  (“GD”) kept at the North­gate of the BPCL compound.

Later, it was found that a conflicting GD entry had been made at  the Main­gate of the BPCL compound a little earlier at around 6:05PM,  noting how an amount of Rs 9,000 had been handed over by dog­  handler Constable KK Sharma (PW­2) on behalf of another official, as  personal loan to Sharma (CW­1). It was discovered over the course of  investigation that this entry was false and had been registered at the  instance of the present appellant who made numerous phone calls  between 6:30 and 7PM to ASI Surjan Singh (PW­5) who was stationed  at the Main­gate and was in­charge of the other GD register.   5.   The following morning, KK Sharma (PW­2) who was projected to  have delivered the cash to Sharma, was pressurised by the appellant  to falsely support his alternate ‘loan’ theory by deposing that he  indeed had delivered the impounded sum of money.   6.   An FIR was thus registered by the respondent­authorities with  the regional Anti­Corruption Branch of the Central Bureau of  Investigation (“CBI”) on 06.03.1999 under various provisions of the  Indian Penal Code, 1860 and the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.  Simultaneously, an enquiry under Rule 34 of CISF Rules, 1969, with  Assistant Commandant PB Patil as the enquiry officer, was also  initiated and the appellant was placed under suspension vide order  dated 31.05.1999.                                                                    Page | 3      a. Chargesheet  7.   The chargesheet contained three charges against the appellant,  first, gross misconduct and indiscipline by virtue of ordering of a false  GD Entry (No. 257, on 6:05PM at 28.02.1999); second, becoming an  extra­constitutional authority by issuing unlawful orders to Constable  KK Sharma to give false statement to substantiate the aforementioned  fake GD entry; and third, corruption for illegally collecting bribes from  contractors of BPCL through his subordinates. All these charges were  contested by the appellant, who sought and was provided a detailed  list of evidence and documents.        b. Investigation and Enquiry Report  8.   The   enquiry    officer   submitted   a   self­speaking   report   on  17.09.1999, which contained written statements and depositions of  six witnesses who were substantiating the charges, as well as evidence  led by the appellant in the form of five defence witnesses. Inspector  Hiralal Chaudhary (PW­1) testified to the search of Sharma, the  seizure of a sum of Rs 10,780 from his person, and the lack of any  explanation by him on the spot regarding source of the suspicious  sum. Head Constable KK Sharma (PW­2), who as per the appellant’s  defence had handed over the seized amount as loan amount to  Sharma, negated this alternate version and instead implicated the  appellant by mentioning that not only did he not give any money to                                                                     Page | 4 anyone, but that he had instead been threatened by the appellant into  giving a false statement. Head Constable RK Sharma (PW­3) claimed to  have witnessed the search and seizure, and denied any talk of a loan  during such event. ASI Karan Singh (PW­4) deposed that two empty  garbage trucks had entered the BPCL premises earlier in the  afternoon. ASI Surjan Singh (PW­5) testified that at around 6:30PM  when he was on duty at the BPCL Main­gate, he received a call from  the appellant intimidating him into registering a false GD Entry with  earlier time of 6:05PM to substantiate a fictitious loan transaction  with the stated objective of protecting Sharma (CW­1).   9.   Additionally, the enquiry officer examined Constable Ram Avtar  Sharma (CW­1) who testified that at around 2PM on 28.02.1999 he  received a bundle of notes totalling Rs 10,000 on behalf of the  appellant from one DK Parmar, who was contracted by BPCL for the  job of lifting garbage/waste. These notes were in his possession, in  addition to his personal cash of Rs 780, when he was caught around  6:15PM by Chaudhary (PW­1) while he was travelling in the CISF Bus.  He admitted that he had falsely claimed that the money had been  given to him by KK Sharma (PW­2), and in response to a question  disclosed that bribes were illegally collected from BPCL’s contractors  at the rate of Rs 20 per vehicle entering the plant and Rs 5 per vehicle  exiting. The seized sum of money, particularly, was to be handed over                                                                    Page | 5 to the appellant for facilitating theft of ‘iron scrap’ and ‘brass’ which  was smuggled out of the compound in the middle of the garbage. CW­  1, later on though, retracted and claimed that the record reflected  something other than what he had stated, and that his signatures  ought not to be relied upon as he had not read the document.   10.   The appellant in his defence evidence examined Constable MN  Dhanwat (DW­1) who deposed that although he was posted at North­  gate on the date of the incident, he had left for personal work during  duty hours with the permission of the appellant. Constable Jaimal  Singh (DW­2) testified that he had witnessed the search of Sharma  and recording of the GD Entry by Chaudhary when he reached the  North­gate at around 6:40PM. Further, he claimed that Sharma was  repeatedly trying to get in touch with the appellant, but could only get  through at around 7PM and then informed him that he was caught  carrying his own money. ASI SP Mishra (DW­3) who was on duty at  the CISF Control room in Vashi stated that in his presence no  message had been conveyed to the appellant regarding the incident.  PK Nashkar (DW­4) states that during his duty at the ‘Quarter Guard’  in the Vashi Complex at 7PM, he was directed by ASI SP Mishra (DW­  3) to convey a message to the appellant that there was a phone call for  him from Jaimal Singh (DW­2). Finally, Pravin Dhanji Parmar (DW­5),  who had been performing house­keeping work at the BPCL refinery for                                                                    Page | 6 the past twenty years on behalf of contractor DK Parmar & Co, stated  that he did not hand over any money to Sharma. In addition, the  enquiry officer perused the relevant GD entries and other documents  on record.   11.   Based on these numerous evidences and after according the  appellant an opportunity to cross­examine all the witnesses as well as  leading his own substantive arguments, the enquiry officer through  report dated 17.09.1999 held the appellant guilty under each of the  three charges. The enquiry officer found as a matter of fact that the  GD No. 257, entered at 6:05PM on 28.02.1999, was a false entry made  at the instance of the appellant by Surjan Singh (PW­5), so that an  alternate version could be crafted in which Sharma (CW­1) had  allegedly received the seized money as loan. Qua the second charge, it  stood established from the version of KK Sharma (PW­2) that he had  not advanced any loan and that he was approached by the appellant  to give a false statement to substantiate the GD No. 257. Finally, upon  a holistic interpretation of all evidence, that is, falsification of GD,  threatening of KK Sharma (PW­2), as well as indications of wrongdoing  from the statements of other witnesses like DW­1; the enquiry officer  concluded that illegal sums were being collected by the appellant from  BPCL’s contractors through his subordinate officers and therefore, the  third charge of corruption too had been proved.                                                                    Page | 7       c. Proceedings before the Disciplinary Authority  12.   This   voluminous    enquiry    report   was   placed   before   the  disciplinary authority, which gave the appellant both a copy of the  report as well as an opportunity to respond to it. Detailed rebuttals  put forth by the appellant through his written submission dated  14.10.1999 were examined at length by the disciplinary authority.  Preliminary objections of the enquiry officer being biased and of being  pre­disposed to convict the appellant, were rejected by the disciplinary  authority with cogent reasons. It was noted that not only had proper  opportunity of cross­examining witnesses and of availing assistance  been accorded to the appellant, but that sufficient opportunities of  seeking explanations, clarifications and records of testimonies and  documents had in fact also been availed of by him.   13.   The disciplinary authority noted that no material contradictions  could be pointed out in the witnesses’ testimonies, and no compelling  alternate evidence had been produced. Keeping in mind the nature of  the allegations which entailed surreptitious corruption amongst  members of the paramilitary, the disciplinary authority observed that  it was unlikely that there would be independent witnesses to many  incidents like the charge of intimidating KK Sharma (PW­2) to give  false testimony, or of collecting bribe from BPCL’s contractors.   14.   The disciplinary authority noticed that it was an undisputed fact                                                                      Page | 8 that a sum of Rs 10,780 had been recovered from Sharma (CW­1),  which was far in excess of the maximum permissible amount of Rs 10.  The testimonies of different officials revealed the appellant’s modus  operandi of collecting illegal monies through a network of subordinate  officers; and more crucially, his attempts at supressing witnesses and  fabricating evidence when caught. The disciplinary authority noted  that the enquiry officer had followed the prescribed procedure and no  challenge had been made earlier to his impartiality and no request to  change the enquiry officer was ever made. Therefore, no malice or bias  could even be suggested at this stage of the disciplinary proceedings.  Similarly, the appellant’s attempt to implicate other officials was held  to be irrelevant, as the present enquiry was limited only to the  appellant’s conduct.   15.   Thus, considering the serious nature of the misconduct and the  rank and duty bestowed upon the appellant, and the multiplicity of  the charges which called into question both the personal integrity of  the delinquent officer and the collective image of the force, the  Disciplinary Authority passed the order dated 20.11.1999, imposing  exemplary punishment of dismissal from service under Rule 29(a) read  with Rule 31(a) ­ Schedule II of CISF Rules, 1969.                                                                     Page | 9        d. Decision of the Appellate Authority  16.    The appellant preferred departmental appeal against the order of  his dismissal from service before the Deputy Inspector General of the  CISF Western Zone.          In addition to highlighting contradictions in  testimonies and re­interpreting the evidence on record, the appellant  also raised a new defence that the entire proceedings were at the  behest of a particular superior officer.   17.    The appellate authority went into each and every contention of  the appellant and after re­appreciating the evidence on record, it  dismissed the appeal vide order dated 12.07.2000, concluding that:         “Further I find that there is no material irregularity or miscarriage of       justice in the departmental enquiry proceedings. After considering       the gravity of proven misconduct, the petitioner is not found fit for       retention in an armed force of the Union of India like CISF. The       contentions made in his appeal petitions are totally devoid of merits       both in fact and in law. The punishment imposed by the disciplinary       authority is not excessive in view of proven misconduct. As such I do       not find any reason to interfere with the orders passed by the       disciplinary authority and do hereby reject the appeal petition being       devoid merits.”         e. Writ before the High Court  18.    A further challenge was laid to the orders passed by the  Disciplinary and Appellate authorities by way of a writ petition under  Article 226 before the High Court of Bombay. The appellant sought in                                                                            Page | 10 sum and substance, re­appraisal of the evidence on record, claiming  that it was qualitatively insufficient to hold him guilty of the charges  levelled against him. Additionally, the appellant raised a new ground  of non­compliance with Rule 34(10)(ii)(b) of CISF Rules, 1969 which  specified serving of a second show cause notice and opportunity of  hearing regarding the proposed penalty. The appellant fairly submitted  before the High Court that it was not his case that the penalty  imposed against him was disproportionate, if the charges against him  were held to be proved.   19.   The High Court, through the order­under­challenge, conducted a  detailed re­examination of the facts and material­on­record, expanding  the scope of judicial review under Article 226 and concluded that there  existed ample evidence to establish the appellant’s involvement in the  organised collection of illegal monies from BPCL’s contractors and his  role in fabricating official records and intimidating subordinate officers  to falsely testify to support his alternate version.   20.   The High Court categorically held that the domestic enquiry  followed all procedures and was in conformity with principles of  natural justice and the appellant had been accorded numerous  opportunities of putting forth his version of events. The CISF Rule  sought to be relied upon by the appellant, was found to have been  amended in 1981, therefore, leaving no requirement for a separate                                                                   Page | 11 show cause notice at the stage of penalty. The writ petition was  accordingly dismissed on 05.05.2009.   CONTENTIONS     OF   PARTIES  21.   The instant appeal being the last resort, learned senior counsel  for the appellant, once more, took us through the enquiry­record and  highlighted how the main witness (CW­1) had retracted his statement,  and   how    there   was   no   corroboration   between   witnesses   and  documents. The conduct of the enquiry officer was called into  question, contending that his decision to put questions to witnesses  was unfair. Acting as both the judge and prosecutor, the enquiry  officer was alleged to have vitiated the entirety of the proceedings. Till  the last minute, the appellant vehemently stuck to his alternate  version that the recovered sum of Rs 10,780 was nothing but a loan  extended between two officials in a private capacity, and that the false  charges were levelled on him with oblique motives at the instance of  certain superiors. Finally, the appellant sought leniency and urged  that given another 21 years of remaining service, imposition of the  severest    punishment     of   dismissal   from   service   was   highly  disproportionate which ought to shock the conscience of this Court.   22.   These contentions have dexterously been countered by the  learned counsel for the respondents, who highlights through specific  reference to the impugned order that retraction of CW­1’s statement                                                                  Page | 12 had been noted by all prior authorities and that no significant reliance  had been placed on it while holding the appellant guilty. Adequate  opportunities were granted and had been availed by him. Attention  was drawn to the fact that the present proceedings constituted the  fifth venue where the appellant was pleading his case, with the first  four and the CBI having found his guilt concurrently.   23.   The deliberate and planned manner of the falsifications, and the  blatant threats made to subordinate officials was highlighted by the  respondents, and the loan theory propounded by the appellant was  shown as having been recurrently agitated and discarded by all the  previous forums. Given the concurrent findings of the enquiry officer,  disciplinary authority, appellate authority, and the High Court; as well  as the detailed evaluation and reasoned order passed by each, it was  submitted that there remained little scope of re­appreciation or further  adjudication. The ratio of Shashi Prasad v. CISF1 was distilled to  drive home the argument that departmental enquiries don’t stand on  the same pedestal as criminal proceedings. Acquittal in one would not  pre­judge the other owing to a difference in standards of proof. It was  claimed that there could be no re­appreciation of evidence as per Govt  of    Andhra     Pradesh   v.   Mohd   Nasrulla    Khan 2,   and   that   1        2019 7 SCC 797. 2        2006 2 SCC 373.                                                                 Page | 13 Constitutional Courts ought not to act as appellate authorities against  disciplinary proceedings of government employees. Finally, given the  delicate nature of employment in paramilitary forces and breach of the  high trust reposed in him by society, the strict punishment of  dismissal of the appellant from service was justified.   ANALYSIS   24.    At the outset, it may be noted that the appellant has chosen to  raise some new grounds before this Court, despite those issues  involving questions of fact. Nevertheless, a few pertinent questions of  service jurisprudence do arise in this appeal, which we deem  appropriate to answer.     I.     Scope of Judicial Review in Service Matters   25.    Learned counsel for the appellant spent considerable time taking  us through the various evidences­on­record with the intention of  highlighting lacunas and contradictions. We feel that such an exercise  was in vain, as the threshold of interference in the present  proceedings is quite high. The power of judicial review discharged by  Constitutional Courts under Article 226 or 32, or when sitting in  appeal under Article 136, is distinct from the appellate power  exercised by a departmental appellate authority. It would be gainsaid  that judicial review is an evaluation of the decision­making process,                                                                  Page | 14 and not the merits of the decision itself. Judicial Review seeks to  ensure fairness in treatment and not fairness of conclusion. It ought  to be used to correct manifest errors of law or procedure, which might  result     in   significant       injustice;   or   in   case   of   bias   or   gross  unreasonableness of outcome.3   26.    These principles are succinctly elucidated by a three­judge  Bench of this Court in BC Chaturvedi v. Union of India4 in the  following extract:         “12. Judicial review is not an appeal from a decision but a review of       the manner in which the decision is made. Power of judicial review       is meant to ensure that the individual receives fair treatment and       not to ensure that the conclusion which the authority reaches is       necessarily correct in the eye of the court. When an inquiry is       conducted on charges of misconduct by a public servant, the       Court/Tribunal is concerned to determine whether the inquiry was       held by a competent officer or whether rules of natural justice are       complied with. Whether the findings or conclusions are based on       some evidence, the authority entrusted with the power to hold       inquiry has jurisdiction, power and authority to reach a finding of       fact or conclusion. But that finding must be based on some evidence.       Neither the technical rules of Evidence Act nor of proof of fact or       evidence as defined therein, apply to disciplinary proceeding. When       the authority accepts that evidence and conclusion receives support       therefrom, the disciplinary authority is entitled to hold that the       delinquent officer is guilty of the charge. The Court/Tribunal in its  3          Government of Andhra Pradesh v. Mohd Nasrullah Khan, (2006) 2 SCC 373, ¶ 11. 4          (1995) 6 SCC 749 ¶ 12.                                                                               Page | 15       power of judicial review does not act as appellate authority to       reappreciate the evidence and to arrive at its own independent       findings on the evidence. The Court/Tribunal may interfere where       the authority held the proceedings against the delinquent officer in a       manner inconsistent with the rules of natural justice or in violation of       statutory rules prescribing the mode of inquiry or where the       conclusion or finding reached by the disciplinary authority is based       on no evidence. If the conclusion or finding be such as no reasonable       person would have ever reached, the Court/Tribunal may interfere       with the conclusion or the finding, and mould the relief so as to       make it appropriate to the facts of each case.        13. The disciplinary authority is the sole judge of facts. Where       appeal is presented, the appellate authority has coextensive power       to reappreciate the evidence or the nature of punishment. In a       disciplinary inquiry, the strict proof of legal evidence and findings on       that evidence are not relevant. Adequacy of evidence or reliability of       evidence   cannot   be   permitted   to   be   canvassed    before    the       Court/Tribunal. In Union of India v. H.C. Goel [(1964) 4 SCR 718 :       AIR 1964 SC 364 : (1964) 1 LLJ 38] this Court held at p. 728 that if       the conclusion, upon consideration of the evidence reached by the       disciplinary authority, is perverse or suffers from patent error on the       face of the record or based on no evidence at all, a writ of certiorari       could be issued.”  27.    These parameters have been consistently reiterated by this Court  in a catena of decisions, including:     (i)     State of Tamil Nadu v. S Subramaniam, (1996) 7 SCC 509.   (ii)    Lalit Popli v. Canara Bank, (2003) 3 SCC 583.   (iii)   Himachal Pradesh State Electricity Board Ltd v. Mahesh            Dahiya, (2017) 1 SCC 768.                                                                              Page | 16 28.   It is thus well settled that the Constitutional Courts while  exercising their powers of judicial review would not assume the role of  an appellate authority. Their jurisdiction is circumscribed by limits of  correcting errors of law, procedural errors leading to manifest injustice  or violation of principles of natural justice. Put differently, judicial  review is not analogous to venturing into the merits of a case like an  appellate authority.   29.   The High Court was thus rightly concerned more about the  competence of the enquiry officer and adherence to natural justice,  rather than verifying the appellant’s guilt through documents and  statements. It clearly noted that evidence was led, cross­examination  was conducted and opportunities of addressing arguments, raising  objections, and filing appeal were granted. The conclusion obtained  was based upon these very evidences and was detailed and well­  reasoned. Furthermore, the High Court didn’t restrict the scope of  judicial review, rather adopted a liberal approach, and delved further  to come to its own independent conclusion of guilt. Similarly, we have  no doubt in our minds that the appellate authority had carefully dealt  with each plea raised by the appellant in his appeal and had given  detailed responses to all the contentions to satisfy the appellant’s  mind. The disciplinary authority too was impeccable and no infirmity  can be found in the report of the enquiry officer either.                                                                   Page | 17 30.     Even in general parlance, where an appellate or reviewing  Court/authority comes to a different conclusion, ordinarily the  decision under appeal ought not to be disturbed in so far as it remains  plausible or is not found ailing with perversity. The present case is  neither one where there is no evidence, nor is it one where we can  arrive at a different conclusion than the disciplinary authority,  especially for the reasons stated hereunder.     II.     Appropriateness of procedure and PNJ   31.     Significant emphasis has been placed by the appellant on the  fact that the enquiry officer put his own questions to the prosecution  witness and that he cross­examined the witnesses brought forth by  the defence. This, it is claimed, amounts to making the prosecutor the  judge, in violation of the natural justice principle of “nemo judex in sua  causa”. However, such a plea is misplaced. It must be recognized that,  under Section 165, Evidence Act, judges have the power to ask any  question to any witness or party about any fact, in order to discover or  to obtain proper proof of relevant facts. While strict rules of evidence  are inapplicable to disciplinary proceedings, enquiry officers often put  questions to witnesses in such proceedings in order to discover the  truth. Indeed, it may be necessary to do such direct questioning in  certain circumstances. Further, learned counsel for the appellant,  except for making a bald allegation that the enquiry officer has                                                                  Page | 18 questioned the witnesses, did not point to any specific question put by  the officer that would indicate that he had exceeded his jurisdiction.  No specific malice or bias has been alleged against the enquiry officer,  and even during the enquiry no request had been made to seek a  replacement; thus, evidencing how these objections are nothing but an  afterthought.   32.    Rather it appears that the delinquent person received a fair trial,  which can illustratively be determined by analysing whether he  received an opportunity of adducing evidence, cross­examining  witnesses and whether depositions were recorded in his presence. 5  The record clearly elucidates that all these essentials had been duly  observed in the present proceedings. Opportunity to seek assistance of  another officer was accorded, right of making representation was  granted before each authority, multiple opportunities were granted to  lead evidence, cross­examine witnesses, and raise objections. The  appellant exercised most of these options, though some were given up  despite reminders. Minor delays on part of the appellant were ignored  and each concern of his had been addressed through detailed reasons.       III.     Effect of criminal enquiry on disciplinary proceedings   33.    The       incident     of   28.02.1999       raised    serious   questions   of  criminality under the Indian Penal Code and the Prevention of 5            Union of India v. T.R. Varma, 1958 SCR 499 ¶ 10.                                                                               Page | 19 Corruption Act, as well as of violation of Service Regulations and  administrative misconduct. Thus, in addition to appointment of  enquiry officer, the authorities also registered a criminal complaint  with the CBI. After investigation, the CBI though did not find adequate  material to launch criminal prosecution against the appellant but  through    its    self­speaking      report     dated    07.03.2000,     the      CBI  recommended major disciplinary action against the appellant and a  few others.   34.   It is beyond debate that criminal proceedings are distinct from  civil proceedings. It is both possible and common in disciplinary  matters   to     establish   charges     against     a   delinquent    official    by  preponderance of probabilities            and     consequently terminate          his  services. But the same set of evidence may not be sufficient to take  away his liberty under our criminal law jurisprudence. 6 Such  distinction between standards of proof amongst civil and criminal  litigation is deliberate, given the differences in stakes, the power  imbalance between the parties and the social costs of an erroneous  decision. Thus, in a disciplinary enquiry, strict rules of evidence and  procedure of a criminal trial are inapplicable, like say, statements  made before enquiry officers can be relied upon in certain instances. 7    6       Karnataka SRTC v. MG Vittal Rao, (2012) 1 SCC 442, ¶ 11. 7       Ajit Kumar Nag v. Indian Oil Corp Ltd (2005) 7 SCC 764, ¶ 11.                                                                            Page | 20 35.       Thus, the appellant’s contention that he should be exonerated in  the present proceedings as no criminal chargesheet was filed by the  CBI after enquiry, is liable to be discarded. 8 The employer always  retains the right to conduct an independent disciplinary proceeding,  irrespective of the outcome of a criminal proceeding. Furthermore, the  CBI report dated 07.03.2000 does recommend major disciplinary  action against the appellant. The said report also buttresses the  respondent’s case.       IV.      Punishment and plea of leniency   36.       In our considered opinion, the appellant’s contention that the  punishment of dismissal was disproportionate to the allegation of  corruption, is without merit. It is a settled leg"

By a judgment dated 8 January 2016, the Bench of the National Green  Tribunal1 for the Western Zone held that a circular issued by the Union Ministry of  Environment and Forests2 on 14 May 2002 is contrary to law. The circular  envisaged the grant of ex post facto environmental clearances. The NGT issued  a slew of directions including the revocation of environmental clearances and for  closing down industrial units operating without valid consents. On 17 May 2016,  the NGT dismissed an application for review filed by one of the affected industrial  units. The industrial units and MoEF are in appeal 3.  2.      The Environmental Impact Assessment4 notification of 27 January 1994  mandated prior Environmental Clearances5 for setting up and expansion of  industrial projects falling within thirty categories. The deadline for obtaining an EC  under the EIA notification of 1994 was extended by various circulars to 31 March  1999 and thereafter to 30 June 2001. By the circular of 14 May 2002, which was  quashed by the NGT, MoEF extended the period till 31 March 2003 for those  industrial units which had gone into production without obtaining an EC under the  EIA notification of 1994 to apply for and obtain an ex post facto EC. The circular  indicated that it had been decided:  1 “NGT” 2 “MoEF” 3 Civil Appeal no 1526 of 2016 (Alembic Pharmaceuticals Limited); Civil Appeal no 3175 of 2016 (United   Phosphorus Limited); Civil Appeal nos 6604-6605 of 2016 (Unique Chemicals); and Civil Appeal no 42756 of   2016 (Union of India) 4 “EIA” 5 “EC”                                                      2                    “... to extend the deadline upto 31 March 2003 so that                    defaulting units could avail of this last and final opportunity to                    obtain ex-post-facto environmental clearance...”   3.           The circular of 14 May 2002, allowed for ex post facto ECs, subject to a  graded contribution into an earmarked fund based on the investment cost of the  project. The first and the second respondents challenged the circular of 14 May  2002 before the High Court of Gujarat. The proceedings were subsequently  transferred to the NGT. The NGT by its decision dated 8 January 2016 held that  the law did not permit the grant of an ex post facto clearances and that the  circular of 14 May 2002 was an internal communication and did not override the  provisions of the EIA notification dated 27 January 1994 which had been issued  in exercise of statutory powers conferred by Section 3 of the Environment  (Protection) Act 19866.  4.           Having held that the concept of an “ex post facto environmental clearance”  was not sustainable with reference to any provision of law, the NGT issued the  following directions:     (i)   The authorities of the Union of India, including the MoEF,                    State of                  Gujarat, Gujarat Pollution Control Board7 and District Collectors shall                  not grant consent for an industrial activity covered by the EIA                  notification of 1994 without the steps mandated by the notification such                  as screening, scoping, public hearing and decision being fulfilled;      (ii)       The ECs granted to the industrial units of the sixth to ninth respondents                  shall be revoked;      (iii)      All the industrial activities which were being operated without a valid EC                  and consent to operate shall be closed down within one month;   6 “Environment Protection Act 1986” 7 “GPCB”                                                       3         (iv)      Each of the units shall deposit a compensation of ? 10 lakhs for having                    caused environmental degradation; and         (v)       The amount deposited shall be used for the restoration of the                    environment in and around the industrial area of Ankleshwar in the                    State of Gujarat.  5.             The private respondents before the NGT who were affected by the above  directions are:   (i)            United Phosphorous Ltd - the sixth respondent;   (ii)           Unique Chemicals - the seventh respondent;   (iii)          Darshak Private Limited - the eight respondent; and   (iv)           Nirayu Private Limited - the ninth respondent.   The private respondents are engaged in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals and  bulk drugs at the industrial area of Ankleshwar in the State of Gujarat. Alembic  Pharmaceuticals Limited is the appellant in the lead appeal before this Court.  Darshak Private Limited merged with the appellant in 2002 pursuant to a scheme  of amalgamation sanctioned by the High Court of Gujarat. Nirayu Private Limited  was acquired by the appellant under a slump sale on 1 January 2008. Following  this exercise, the manufacturing units of erstwhile Darshak Private Limited and  Nirayu Private Limited have come to be known as API – I and API – II,  respectively.   EIA Notification of 1994                                                      4 6.      The EIA notification was issued by the MoEF on 27 January 1994, in  exercise of its powers under Section 3(1) and clause (v) of Section 3(2) of the  Environment Protection Act 1986 read with Rule 5(3)(d) of the Environment  (Protection) Rules 19868. The EIA notification stipulated that:                  “…on and form the date of publication of this notification in                 the Official Gazette, expansion or modernization of any                 activity (if pollution load is to exceed the existing one) or new                 project listed in Schedule I to this notification, shall not be                 undertaken in any part of India unless it has been accorded                 environmental clearance by the Central Government in                 accordance with the procedure hereinafter specified in this                 notification.”    7.      The EIA notification stipulated that any person who desired to undertake a  new project, or the expansion or modernisation of an existing industry, listed in  Schedule-I shall submit an application to the Secretary, MoEF. Entry 8 of  Schedule - I includes industries engaged in manufacturing                           bulk drugs and  pharmaceuticals. The application had to be accompanied by a project report  including, inter alia, an EIA report and an environmental management plan  prepared in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Union Government  through the MoEF from time to time. The notification spelt out the procedure to be  followed upon the submission of the application including an evaluation and  assessment by a stipulated agency. Clause 3(a)9 provided that:                 “...no construction work primarily or otherwise relating to the                 setting up of the project may be undertaken till the                 environmental and site clearances is obtained.” 8.      On 10 April 1997, the EIA notification of 1994 was amended by making a  public hearing mandatory for thirty categories of activities which required an EC.  On 5 November 1998, the MoEF issued a circular recording that though the EIA  8 “Environment Protection Rules” 9 Which was (substituted on 4 May 1994)                                                   5 notification of 1994 was in effect since 27 January 1994, units covered by the  notification had been set up without obtaining prior ECs. The GPCB had despite  the advice of the MoEF allowed units to operate without valid ECs. In this  backdrop, the circular of 5 November 1998 provided that:               “Since number of such proposals are large in number and              many of the units have not applied for environmental              clearance genuinely out of ignorance it has been decided to              consider their case for environmental clearance on merits.              This will apply only to those proposals which are received in              the Ministry till 31st March 1999. Simultaneously State              Pollution Control Boards have also been advised to issue              requisite notices to the units to apply for environmental              clearance. In case of those units which have already started              production, we may consider the proposals on merits and if              necessary suggest additional mitigative measures. A formal              environmental clearance will be issued in these cases after              approval by the competent authority.”    9.    By a circular dated 27 December 2000, the MoEF directed all state  pollution control boards to issue fresh notices to all defaulting units and extended  the deadline to obtain ECs from 31 March 1999 to 30 June 2001. Inspite of this,  there were delinquent units which had either failed to apply for an EC or had  failed to complete the requirement of a public hearing before the extended date.  By the circular of 14 May 2002, the deadline was extended to 31 March 2003.  The circular stated that:               “Keeping the foregoing in view, it has been decided to extend              the deadline upto 31 March 2003 so that defaulting units              could avail of this last and final opportunity to obtain ex-post-              facto environmental clearance. This would apply to all such              units,      which        had      commenced          construction              activities/operations without obtaining prior environmental              clearance in violation of the EIA Notification of 27 January              1994.”                                                   6 10.     In terms of the circular, those defaulting units seeking an expansion were  to earmark a separate fund for “eco-development measures including community  development measures in Indian projects areas” on a graded scale linked to the  investment in the project. This was indicated in a tabulated form which read thus:   A     Projects with investment upto ? 100 crores            1 % of the project cost with a                                                             minimum of ? 50,000 B     Projects with investment beyond ? 100 crores and upto 0.5% of the project cost       ? 1,000 crores                                        subject to a minimum of ? 1                                                             crore and a maximum of ?                                                             2.5 crores C     Projects with investment exceeding ? 1000 crores      0.25 % of the project cost                                                             subject to a maximum of ? 5                                                             crores    Units which failed to comply with the extended deadline were to be proceeded  against.   The challenge to the ex post facto circular dated 14 May 2002     11.     A petition was instituted under Article 226 of the Constitution by the first  and second respondents in the present lead appeal before the High Court of  Gujarat challenging the circular dated 14 May 2002 and seeking the revocation of  the clearances which were granted to the industrial units in question. The case  was transferred to the Western Zonal Bench of the NGT by the High Court of  Gujarat on 21 April 2015. The NGT by its judgment dated 8 January 2016 set  aside the circular dated 14 May 2002 and issued consequential directions which  have been noted in the earlier part of this judgment. Unique Chemicals Limited,  the seventh respondent before the NGT, preferred a review petition against the                                                  7 judgment of the NGT which was dismissed. The affected industrial units and the  MoEF are in appeal before this Court.  12.     The issue to be adjudicated is whether in view of the requirement of a prior  EC under the EIA notification of 1994, a provision for an ex post facto EC to  industrial units could be validly made by means of the circular dated 14 May  2002.  13.     During the course of the submissions, Mr Kapil Sibal, learned Senior  Counsel appearing on behalf of Alembic Pharmaceuticals Limited has urged the  following submissions:  (i)    The issue is academic as both the units of the appellant have been          granted an EC for subsequent expansion to a much higher capacity after          conducting a public hearing and upon consideration of all material factors.          The relevant details in support of the submission are thus:               Darshak Private Limited (API - I)           (a) An EC was granted on 14 May 2003 for a capacity of 15 MT per              month;           (b) An EC was granted on 16 April 2008 for expansion of capacity from              15 MT per month to 25 MT per month; and           (c) An EC was granted on 31 January 2017 for a further expansion of              capacity from 25 to 75 MT per month.               Nirayu Private Limited (API – II)           (a) An EC was granted on 14 May 2003 for a capacity of 47 MT per              month; and                                            8          (b) An EC was granted on 20 December 2016 for an expanded capacity              of 300 MT per month.  (ii)    The EIA notification of 1994 omits the expression “prior”. This is           contrasted with the EIA notification dated 14 September 2006 which           stipulates the requirement of a “prior” EC. While a prior EC is mandatory           under the notification dated 14 September 2006, it was not under the           earlier notification dated 27 January 1994;  (iii)   Once an EC has been granted for a much larger capacity after           conducting a prior public hearing, the question as to whether the first EC           for a lesser capacity was valid, is of no significance. Since both the units           have an EC for a larger capacity, the satisfaction for granting an EC for a           lesser capacity would be subsumed;  (iv)    The EIA notification of 1994 did not apply to the two units of the appellant           (API – I and API – II). Clause 8 of the explanatory note to the EIA           notification of 1994 provides that where a no objection certificate 10 from           GPCB has been obtained before 27 January 1994, an EC is not required.            In this context it has been submitted that:          (a) On 17 July 1992, GPCB granted an NOC to establish and manufacture               to the manufacturing unit of API - I;          (b) On 29 May 1997 and 27 July 1998, GPCB granted an authorisation to              operate under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act 1981 11to               API - I;          (c) On 11 October 1999, GPCB granted API – I an authorisation to operate               under the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act 1974 12;          (d) On 24 May 1985,GPCB granted API - II a consent order under the              Water Act;   10 “NOC” 11 “Air Act” 12 “Water Act”                                            9         (e) On 9 October 1991, GPCB granted a site clearance certificate to API –              II;         (f) On 12 May 1993,GPCB granted an NOC to API - II to establish and for              the manufacture drugs;         (g) On 23 September 1993 and 13 November 1999, GPCB granted a              consent under the Water Act to API - II;         (h) On 14 December 2001, GPCB granted an authorisation to API - II to             operate under the Hazardous Waste (Management and Handling)              Rules 198913; and         (i) On 1 September 1999, 14 December 2001 and 7 March 2008, GPCB             granted a consolidated consent and authorisation to API - II.  (v)     A public hearing was not mandatory under the EIA notification of 1994.          Clause 4 of the explanatory note confers a discretion to call for a hearing          in case of projects that may cause large scale displacement or with          severe environmental ramifications; (vi)    If the order of the NGT prevails, the appellant would be prejudiced and          suffer an irreparable loss. The appellant has made an investment of over          ? 293 crores and employed a labour force of over 1000 workers; and (vii)   The first respondent who was the petitioner before the NGT chose to          target only the appellant and two others out of over ninety different entities          which were granted similar clearances. This cherry picking of certain          select units demonstrates the mala fide nature of the proceedings.  14.     During the course of his submissions, Mr C U Singh, learned Senior  Counsel appearing on behalf of United Phosphorus Limited has urged the  following submissions: (i)    The circular dated 5 November 1998, by which the deadline for obtaining          ECs under the EIA notification of 1994 was extended to 30 June 2001 was   13 “Hazardous Waste Rules”                                           10         not challenged. The circular dated 5 November 1998 specifically noted that          the State Pollution Control Board had despite the advice of the MoEF          allowed units to operate without valid ECs; (ii)    United Phosphorus Limited had all requisite ECs that were granted by          GPCB for the existing and expanded capacity. In this context it has been          submitted:         (a) An EC was granted on 17 July 2003 for manufacturing Phorate and             Terbuphose (300 MT per month combined) and Acephate (80 MT per              month);         (b) An EC was granted on 15 April 2008 for the expansion of capacity for             manufacturing pesticides and intermediate products. Production of             Phorate and Terbuphose was increased from 300 MT per month to 500             MT per month, and production of Acephate was increased to 1000 MT              per month;         (c) An EC was granted on 10 January 2020 for an enhanced capacity of             9546 MT per month;  (iii)   The complainant, the first respondent in the lead appeal, attended the          public hearing held on 16 January 2002 prior to the grant of an EC on 17          July 2003 and raised no objections; (iv)    If the order of the NGT prevails, the appellant would be prejudiced and          suffer an irreparable loss. The appellant has employed approximately 400          permanent and contract workers at its manufacturing unit; and (v)     The challenge by the first and second respondents was to the EIA          notification 1994 which did not apply to the manufacturing unit of the          appellant. At the relevant time, the appellant was exempted from obtaining          an EC since it had all requisite permissions. In this context it has been          submitted:                                           11        (a) On 3 October 1992, GPCB granted an NOC to the appellant for setting             up a manufacturing unit;        (b) On 17 November 1995 and 2 April 1996, GPCB granted NOCs for             expansion and manufacturing additional products;        (c) On 27 August 2009, GPCB granted a consolidated consent and             authorisation to the appellant’s manufacturing unit;        (d) On 25 July 2012, GPCB issued an NOC for the expansion of the             appellant’s manufacturing unit; and        (e) On 11 May 2015 and 27 May 2017,GPCB granted a consolidated             consent and authorisation for expanded operations.  15.    Appearing for Unique Chemicals Limited, Dr Abhishek Singhvi, learned  Senior Counsel urged the following submissions:   (i)    The NGT did not have the jurisdiction to entertain the petition filed by the         first and second respondents in view of the decision of this Court in Techi         Tagi Tara v Rajendra Singh Bhandari & Ors14;   (ii)   The EC granted in 2007 superseded the earlier EC granted in 2002.         Therefore, the question of validity of the earlier EC does not arise. In this         context it has been submitted:          (a) An EC was granted on 23 December 2002 for a capacity of 78.02 MT             per month for manufacturing bulk drugs and intermediates;          (b) An EC was granted on 8 August 2007 for an increase in manufacturing             capacity from 78.02 MT per month to 116.12 MT per month; and          (c) An EC was granted on 30 June 2018 for an increase in the             manufacturing capacity to 290 MT per month. On 10 April 2019, the  14 2018 (11) SCC 734                                          12            above EC was amended allowing an increase in the number of             products permitted to be manufactured by the appellant.   (iii)   The ex post facto clearance granted to the appellant cannot be set aside          by the order of the NGT in terms of the decision of this Court in Goa          Foundation v Union of India15, where 95 industrial projects were          accorded ex post facto clearances in terms of the circular dated 14 May          2002. Accordingly, no question of closing down the manufacturing units of          the appellants can arise;   (iv)    The requirement of an ex post facto public hearing was introduced by an          amendment in 1997 to the EIA notification of 1994. The legality of an ex          post facto public hearing has been upheld by this Court in Lafarge Umiam          Mining Pvt Ltd v Union of India16;   (v)     In various cases where there has been a violation of law, this court has not          ordered the closure considering the significant investment and expansion          undertaken by the industry. In Electrotherm Ltd v Patel17, this Court did          not order closure of the plant since a significant expansion had already          taken place and the industry was functioning;   (vi)    If the order of the NGT prevails, the appellant would be prejudiced and          suffer an irreparable loss. The appellant has employed approximately 400          employees at its manufacturing unit;     15 (2005) 11 SCC 559 16 (2011) 7 SCC 338 17 (2016) 9 SCC 300                                           13 (vii)   The EIA notification 1994 did not apply to the manufacturing unit of the          appellant. The manufacturing unit of the appellant was exempt from          obtaining an EC as it had all the requisite permissions. In this context it has          been submitted:           (a) On 30 September 1995, GPCB issued an ‘air consent order’ under the              Air Act;         (b) On 9 January 1996 GPCB issued an authorisation under the Hazardous              Waste Rules;         (c) On 16 April 1996 GPCB issued a ‘water consent order’ under the Water              Act;         (d) On 15 April 2009 GPCB granted a consolidated consent and              authorisation to the manufacturing unit of the appellant;         (e) On 11 June 2010 and 26 June 2012, GPCB amended the consolidated              consent and authorisation granted to the appellant on 13 April 2009;         (f) On 30 May 2011, GPCB granted consent to set up a gas-based power             generation plant having a capacity of 400 KW at the manufacturing unit              of the appellant;         (g) On 2 November 2013, GPCB granted a fresh consolidated consent and              authorisation to the manufacturing unit of the appellant; and         (h) On 25 January 2019 and 25 October 2019, GPCB granted a fresh and             revised consolidated consent and authorisation, respectively for an             increase in the number of products permitted to be manufactured at the             manufacturing unit of the appellant.  16.     Appearing for the first and second respondents, Mr Siddharth Seem,  learned counsel has urged the following submissions before this Court: (i)   The circular dated 14 May 2002 is illegal because environmental          jurisprudence does not recognise any concept of ex post facto clearances.          Any ex post facto approval is void and the benefit of the circular cannot be                                             14         given to such an industry. In this regard, reliance was placed upon the          decision of this Court in Common Cause v Union of India18; (ii)    The circular dated 14 May 2002 does not mention its source or authority of          law. The source of the circular is not traceable to Section 3 of the          Environment Protection Act 1986 because the circular does not protect or          improve the quality of the environment. The circular allows defaulters to get          ex post facto clearances and does not encourage compliance with the law; (iii)   The Comprehensive Environmental Pollution Index report by the Central          Pollution Control Board indicates that the air, water and soil parameters in          and around the industrial area of Ankleshwar in the State of Gujarat, where          the three industrial units are located, are among the most critical in India:          and (iv)    Even if this court were to hold that the closure of the industries should not          be ordered, compensation should be directed to be paid by them for          restoration of the environment. These industries have brazenly operated          for years without environmental clearances.  17.     The rival submissions fall for our consideration.  18.     We first address the challenge to the jurisdiction of the NGT to strike down  rules or regulations made under the Environment Protection Act 1986. In Tamil  Nadu Pollution Control Board v Sterlite Industries (I) Ltd 19 (“Sterlite”) this  Court analysed the adjudicatory functions which have been entrusted to the NGT  under the National Green Tribunal Act 2010 20. Justice R F Nariman, speaking for  a two judge Bench held that while exercising its jurisdiction under Section 16, the  NGT cannot strike down rules or regulations made under the Environment   18 (2017) 9 SCC 499 19 2019 SCC Online SC 221 / Civil Appeal nos 4763-4764 of 2013 20 “NGT Act”                                                    15 Protection Act 1986. In coming to this conclusion, the Court relied on the decision  in Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited v Telecom Regulatory Authority of India 21,  where the appellate power contained in Section 14 of the Telecom Regulatory  Authority of India Act22 1997 was interpreted. After adverting to this decision,  Justice R F Nariman concluded that:                 “53…the NGT has no general power of judicial review akin to                that vested under Article 226 of the Constitution of India                possessed by the High Courts of this country.”    19.    While placing reliance on the above decision, Mr ANS Nadkarni, learned  Additional Solicitor General made an attempt to demonstrate that the power to  issue the circular dated 14 May 2002 that extended the deadline for defaulting  units to avail of an ex post facto clearance until 30 March 2003 could well be  traceable to Section 3 of the Environment Protection Act 1986. Section 3, to the  extent relevant, provides thus:                 “Section 3. Power of central government to take measures to                protect and improve environment.- (1) Subject to the                provisions of this Act, the Central Government, shall have the                power to take all such measures as it deems necessary or                expedient for the purpose of protecting and improving the                quality of the environment and preventing controlling and                abating environmental pollution.”    20.    Section 3(1) is an enabling provision for the Central Government to  undertake all such measures as it deems necessary or expedient for the purpose  of protecting and improving the quality of the environment and preventing,  controlling and abating environmental pollution. This limb of the submission of the   21 (2014) 3 SCC 222 22 “TRAI Act”                                                16 Additional Solicitor General is crucial to the issue as to whether the NGT has  exceeded its jurisdiction since the decision in Sterlite holds that the NGT, while  exercising its appellate jurisdiction, “cannot strike down rules or regulations made  under this Act”. In the present case, to demonstrate that the NGT did not have  the jurisdiction to strike down the circular dated 14 May 2002, it was urged that  the circular was issued by the MoEF pursuant to its powers under Section 3 of  the Environment Protection Act 1986. There is an inherent difficulty in accepting  the submission. Before this Court, the Union of India has not pleaded the case  that the circular dated 14 May 2002 is a measure which is traceable to the  provisions of Section 3. On the contrary, in its pleadings the Union of India  construed it as a “purely administrative decision”. Ground (iii) in paragraph 3 of  the memo of appeal states the position of the Union government:               “Because the Hon’ble Tribunal failed to appreciate that after              the EIA, Notification 1994 the opportunity to seek ex-post              facto environmental clearance was given to industries in              background of far reaching impact in terms of direct loss of              livelihood in the employees working in the units which also              supply inputs to other units and their indirect employment. It              was submitted to the Hon’ble High Court of Gujarat that              issuance of circular dated 14/05/2002, based on which              environmental clearance was given, was purely an              administrative decision before taking stringent action.”                                                        (Emphasis supplied)  21.   The omission in the appeal to make any attempt to sustain the circular  dated 14 May 2002 with reference to the provisions of Section 3 of the  Environment Protection Act 1986 is significant. For an action of the Central  government to be treated as a measure referable to Section 3 it must satisfy the  statutory requirement of being necessary or expedient “for the purpose of  protecting and improving the quality of the environment and preventing,                                               17 controlling and abating environment pollution”. The circular dated 14 May 2002 in  fact does quite the contrary. It purported to allow an extension of time for  industrial units to comply with the requirement of an EC. The EIA notification  dated 27 January 1994 mandated that an EC has to be obtained before  embarking on a new project or expanding or modernising an existing one. The  EIA notification of 1994 has been issued under the provisions of the Environment  Protection Act 1986 and the Environment Protection Rules 1986, with the object  of imposing restrictions and prohibitions on setting up of new projects or  expansion or modernisation of existing project. The measures are based on the  precautionary principle and aim to protect the interests of the environment. The  circular dated 14 May 2002 allowed defaulting industrial units who had  commenced activities without an EC to cure the default by an ex post facto  clearance. Being an administrative decision, it is beyond the scope of Section 3  and cannot be said to be a measure for"

In this appeal, the constitutional validity of clause (f) of            Section 43B of the Income Tax Act, 1961 1 arises for our            consideration as a result of the decision of the High Court at            Calcutta2 vide order dated 27.06.2007 in APO No. 301 of 2005,            wherein it is held that the said clause is arbitrary and violative of            Article 14 of the Constitution of India on various counts, as            discussed hereinafter.            2. Signature Not Verified                          The stated clause (f) was inserted in the already existing Digitally signed by DEEPAK SINGH            Section 43B vide Finance Act, 2001 with effect from 1.4.2002, in Date: 2020.04.24 15:21:50 IST Reason:               1 For short, “the 1961 Act”           2 For short, “the High Court”                                      2   order to provide for a tax disincentive in cases of deductions  claimed by the assessee from income tax in lieu of liability  accrued under the leave encashment scheme but not actually  discharged by the employer. This clause made the actual  payment of liability to the employees as a condition precedent for  extending the benefit of deduction under the 1961 Act. With the  application of clause (f), the eligibility for deduction arises in the  previous year in which the abovesaid payment is actually made  and not in which provision was made in that regard, irrespective  of the system of accounting followed by the assessee. Before we  delve into further examination, we deem it apposite to reproduce  the amended Section 43B of the 1961 Act as applicable to the  present case, which reads thus:          “43­B. Certain deductions to be only on actual         payment.­ Notwithstanding anything contained in any         other provision of this Act, a deduction otherwise         allowable under this Act in respect of ­         (a) any sum payable by the assessee by way of tax, duty,         cess or fee, by whatever name called, under any law for         the time being in force, or         (b) any sum payable by the assessee as an employer by         way of contribution to any provident fund or         superannuation fund or gratuity fund or any other fund         for the welfare of employees, or         (c) any sum referred to in clause (ii) of sub­section (1) of         section 36, or         (d) any sum payable by the assessee as interest on any         loan or borrowing from any public financial institution or         a State financial corporation or a State industrial                               3   investment corporation, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement governing such loan or borrowing, or (e) any sum payable by the assessee as interest on any term loan from a scheduled bank in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement governing such loan, or (f) any sum payable by the assessee as an employer in lieu of any leave at the credit of his employee, shall be allowed (irrespective of the previous year in which the liability to pay such sum was incurred by the assessee according to the method of accounting regularly employed by him) only in computing the income referred to in section 28 of that previous year in which such sum is actually paid by him: Provided that nothing contained in this section shall apply in relation to any sum referred to in clause (a) or clause (c) or clause (d) or clause (e) or clause (f) which is actually paid by the assessee on or before the due date applicable in his case for furnishing the return of income under sub­section (1) of section 139 in respect of the previous year in which the liability to pay such sum was incurred as aforesaid and the evidence of such payment is furnished by the assessee along with such return: Provided further that no deduction shall, in respect of any sum referred to in clause (b), be allowed unless such sum has actually been paid in cash or by issue of a cheque or draft or by any other mode on or before the due date as defined in the Explanation below clause (va) of sub­section (1) of Section 36, and where such payment has been made otherwise than in cash, the sum has been realised within fifteen days from the due date. Explanation 1.—For the removal of doubts, it is hereby declared that where a deduction in respect of any sum referred to in clause (a) or clause (b) of this section is allowed in computing the income referred to in section 28 of the previous year (being a previous year relevant to the assessment year commencing on the 1st day of April, 1983, or any earlier assessment year) in which the liability to pay such sum was incurred by the assessee, the assessee shall not be entitled to any deduction under this section in respect of such sum in computing the income of the previous year in which the sum is actually paid by him.                              4   Explanation 2.—For the purposes of clause (a), as in force at all material times, “any sum payable” means a sum for which the assessee incurred liability in the previous year even though such sum might not have been payable within that year under the relevant law. Explanation 3.—For the removal of doubts it is hereby declared that where a deduction in respect of any sum referred to in clause (c) or clause (d) of this section is allowed in computing the income referred to in section 28 of the previous year (being a previous year relevant to the assessment year commencing on the 1st day of April, 1988, or any earlier assessment year) in which the liability to pay such sum was incurred by the assessee, the assessee shall not be entitled to any deduction under this section in respect of such sum in computing the income of the previous year in which the sum is actually paid by him. Explanation 3A.—For the removal of doubts, it is hereby declared that where a deduction in respect of any sum referred to in clause (e) of this section is allowed in computing the income referred to in section 28 of the previous year (being a previous year relevant to the assessment year commencing on the 1st day of April, 1996, or any earlier assessment year) in which the liability to pay such sum was incurred by the assessee, the assessee shall not be entitled to any deduction under this section in respect of such sum in computing the income of the previous year in which the sum is actually paid by him. Explanation 3B.—For the removal of doubts, it is hereby declared that where a deduction in respect of any sum referred to in clause (f) of this section is allowed in computing the income, referred to in section 28, of the previous year (being a previous year relevant to the assessment year commencing on the 1st day of April, 2001, or any earlier assessment year) in which the liability to pay such sum was incurred by the assessee, the assessee shall not be entitled to any deduction under this section in respect of such sum in computing the income of the previous year in which the sum is actually paid by him. Explanation 4.—For the purposes of this section,—    (a) “public financial institutions” shall have the        meaning assigned to it in section 4A of the        Companies Act, 1956 (1 of 1956);                                         5                 (aa) “scheduled bank” shall have the meaning               assigned to it in the Explanation to clause (iii) of sub­               section (5) of section 11;               (b)   “State financial corporation” means a financial               corporation established under section 3 or section 3A               or an institution notified under section 46 of the State               Financial Corporations Act, 1951 (63 of 1951);               (c)   “State industrial investment corporation” means               a Government company within the meaning of section               617 of the Companies Act, 1956 (1 of 1956), engaged               in the business of providing long­term finance for               industrial projects and eligible for deduction under               clause (viii) of sub­section (1) of section 36.”  3.      The respondents, being liable to pay income tax upon the  profits and gains of their business, found themselves aggrieved  with the inclusion of clause (f) in Section 43B and contended that  Section 145 of the 1961 Act offers them the choice of method of  accounting and accordingly, they computed their profits and  gains of business in accordance with the mercantile system. As  per     the   mercantile     system,     income       and   expenditure      are  determined on the basis of accrual or provision and not on the  basis    of   actual    receipt/payment.        The    respondents        further  contended that Section 43B has been carved out as an exception  to the afore­stated general rule of accrual for determination of  liability, as it subjects deductions in lieu of certain kinds of  liabilities to actual payment. According to the respondents, the  exception under Section 43B comes into operation only in a                                   6   limited set of cases covering statutory liabilities like tax, duty,  cess etc. and other liabilities created for the welfare of employees  and therefore, the liability under the leave encashment scheme  being a trading liability cannot be subjected to the exception  under Section 43B of the 1961 Act.  4.      It is the case of the respondents that the judgment of this  Court in Bharat Earth Movers vs. Commissioner of Income  Tax, Karnataka3 holds the field of law as far as the nature of  the liability of leave encashment is concerned. The said  judgment, while dealing with the principles of accounting under  Section 37, conclusively holds that if a business liability has  arisen definitely, deduction may be claimed against the same in  the previous year in which such liability has accrued, even if it  has not been finally discharged. The Court further held that the  liability in lieu of leave encashment scheme is a present and  definite liability and not a contingent liability. As regards the  nature of the leave encashment liability, the respondents urge  that this liability is carved in the nature of a beneficial provision  and leave can only be encashed by the employees in accordance  with the terms and conditions of employment. It is further  3    (2000) 6 SCC 645                                   7   contended that since the due date for encashment of leave does  not arise in the same accounting year in which provision is made,  there is no question of subjecting the deductions against such  liability upon actual payment.  5.   Having stated that all the clauses under Section 43B,  barring clause (f), cover liabilities of a statutory nature and those  driven by concerns of employees’ welfare, the respondents would  urge that the liability covered by clause (f) is of a completely  distinct nature and without specifying clear objects and reasons  for the inclusion of this liability under Section 43B, it cannot be  slipped into the main section. Further, the nature of this liability  is neither in sync with the objects and reasons of the original  section nor with those of other clauses enacted from time to time  in different assessment years.  6.   The respondents also urge that the enactment of clause (f)  was driven by the sole consideration of subjugating the legal  position expounded by this Court in Bharat Earth Movers  (supra) without removing the basis thereof.        Such enactment  would fall foul of the scheme of the Constitution. It would be an                                        8   inroad into the sphere reserved exclusively for the judiciary and  thereby violate the essential principles of separation of powers.  7.      The validity of clause (f) faced judicial scrutiny first before  the single Judge of the High Court. The clause passed the  constitutional muster of the Court, which had observed thus:            “Thus the position of law existing at the date of insertion           of cl. (f) did not oblige the employer to actually pay the           leave encashment benefit either to his employee or to any           fund or to any third party, though the liability was an           accrued one. If the employer, of his own accord,           maintained a fund, he maintained it for his own           convenience, and not because of any legal obligation. But           in view of the mercantile system of accounting followed he           was justified in showing the accrued liability and claiming           deduction. There was nothing to prevent him from           enjoying the benefit of deduction and at the same time           from controlling and using the amount for his own           benefit, till he was compelled to give the benefit of the           leave in question to the employee concerned. It is evident           that the clause was inserted to curb the abuse of existing           law and protect the interests of the employee.”  Addressing the argument that the insertion of the said clause  was solely intended to defeat the judgment of this Court in  Bharat Earth Movers (supra), the learned single Judge stated  thus:            “… It is true that the action neutralized the effect of the           apex court decision in Bharat Earth Movers case, but I do           not agree that it has amounted to encroachment upon the           powers of the judiciary. Once the existing legal position           was explained by their Lordships, I think, it was quite           natural for the legislature to examine the situation and           legislate according to the need. The binding decision of           the highest court was not nullified in the process; only           the position of law was changed prospectively.”                                     9    8.   The decision of the learned single Judge was appealed and  came to be reversed by the Division Bench of the High Court. The  Division Bench, while holding clause (f) as unconstitutional,  observed thus:         “... While inserting sub­section (f) no special reasons were        disclosed. His Lordship held that such disclosure was not        mandatory. We do not have any reason for disagreement        on such issue provided the subject amendment could be        termed as in furtherance to widen the scope of original        section on the identical objects and reasons as disclosed        at the time of enacting the original provision. As we find,        the original section was incorporated to plug in        deductions claimed by not discharging statutory        liabilities. We also find that provision was subsequently        made to restrict deductions on account of unpaid loan to        the financial institutions. Leave encashment is neither        statutory liability nor a contingent liability. It was a        provision to be made for the entitlement of an employee        achieved in a particular financial year. An employee earns        certain amount by not taking leave which he or she is        otherwise entitled to in that particular year. Hence, the        employer is obliged to make appropriate provision for the        said amount. Once the employee retires he or she has to        be paid such sum on cumulative basis which the        employee earns throughout his or her service career [sic]        unless he or she avails the leave earned [sic] by him or        her. That, in our view, could not have any nexus with the        original enactment. An employer is entitled to deduction        for the expenditure he incurs for running his business        which includes payment of salary and other perquisites to        his employees. Hence, it is a trading liability. As such he        is otherwise entitled to have deduction of such amount by        showing the same as a provisional expenditure in his        accounts. The legislature by way of amendment restricts        such deduction in case of leave encashment unless it is        actually paid in that particular financial year. The        legislature is free to do so after they disclose reasons        for that and such reasons are not inconsistent with        the main object of the enactment. We are deprived of        such reasons for our perusal ...”                                       10                                                   (emphasis supplied)  It also held that the subject matter of clause (f) was inconsistent  with the original Section 43B and observed as follows:          “… We also do not find such enactment consistent with         the original provision being Section 43B which was         originally inserted to plug in evasion of statutory liability.         The Apex Court considered the situation in the case of         Bharat Earth Movers (Supra) when sub­section (f) was not         there. The Apex Court, considering all aspect as disclosed         by us hereinbefore, rejected the contention of the Revenue         and granted appropriate deduction to the concerned         assessee. The legislature to get rid of the decision of the         Apex Court brought out the amendment which would         otherwise nullify the judge made law. The Apex Court         decisions are judge made law and are applicable to all         under the Constitution…”  It is noteworthy that the High Court did not question the  existence of power of the legislature to enact the subject clause,  as can be discerned from the following observations:          “… We, not for a single moment, observe that legislature         was not entitled to bring such amendment. They were         within their power to bring such amendment. However,         they must disclose reason which would be consistent with         the provisions of the Constitution and the laws of the         land and not for the sole object of nullifying the Apex         Court decision.”  9.   We shall now examine clause (f) on the touchstone of the  Constitution, to be followed by an analysis of the impugned  judgment.                                        11   10.      We have heard Ms. Chinmayee Chandra, learned counsel  for the appellants and Dr. Aman Hingorani, learned counsel for  the respondents.     Constitutional validity of clause (f)  11.      The approach of the Court in testing the constitutional  validity of a provision is well settled and the fundamental concern  of the Court is to inspect the existence of enacting power and  once such power is found to be present, the next examination is  to ascertain whether the enacted provision impinges upon any  right enshrined in Part III of the Constitution. Broadly speaking,  the process of examining validity of a duly enacted provision, as  envisaged under Article 13 of the Constitution, is premised on  these two steps. No doubt, the second test of infringement of Part  III is a deeper test undertaken in light of settled constitutional  principles. In State of Madhya Pradesh vs. Rakesh Kohli &  Anr.4, this Court observed thus:               “17. This Court has repeatedly stated that legislative              enactment can be struck down by Court only on two              grounds, namely (i) that the appropriate legislature              does not have competence to make the law, and (ii)              that it does not take away or abridge any of the              fundamental rights enumerated in Part III of the 4     (2012) 6 SCC 312                                          12                Constitution      or     any     other     constitutional              provisions….”                                                    (emphasis supplied)  The above exposition has been quoted by this Court with  approval in a catena of other cases including Bhanumati & Ors.  vs. State of Uttar Pradesh & Ors.5, State of Andhra Pradesh  & Ors. vs. Mcdowell & Co. & Ors. 6 and Kuldip Nayar & Ors.  vs. Union of India & Ors.7, to state a few.   12.      In furtherance of the two­fold approach stated above, the  Court, in Rakesh Kohli (supra) also called for a prudent  approach to the following principles while examining the validity  of statutes on taxability:               “32. While dealing with constitutional validity of a              taxation law enacted by Parliament or State Legislature,              the court must have regard to the following principles:                     (i) there is always presumption in favour of                     constitutionality of a law made by Parliament or a                     State Legislature,                     (ii) no enactment can be struck down by just                     saying that it is arbitrary or unreasonable or                     irrational but some constitutional infirmity has                     to be found,                     (iii) the court is not concerned with the wisdom or                     unwisdom, the justice or injustice of the law as                     Parliament and State Legislatures are supposed to                     be alive to the needs of the people whom they                     represent and they are the best judge of the   5     (2010) 12 SCC 1 6     (1996) 3 SCC 709 7     (2006) 7 SCC 1                                    13                community by whose suffrage they come into              existence,              (iv) hardship is not relevant in pronouncing on the              constitutional validity of a fiscal statute or              economic law, and              (v) in the field of taxation, the legislature enjoys              greater latitude for classification…..”                                                 (emphasis supplied)  13.   In the present case, the legislative power of the Parliament  to enact clause (f) in the light of Article 245 is not doubted at all.  That brings us to the next step of examination i.e. whether the  said clause contravenes any right enshrined in Part III of the  Constitution, either in its form, substance or effect. It is no more  res integra that the examination of the Court begins with a  presumption in favour of constitutionality. This presumption is  not just borne out of judicial discipline and prudence, but also  out of the basic scheme of the Constitution wherein the power to  legislate is the exclusive domain of the Legislature/Parliament.  This power is clothed with power to decide when to legislate,  what to legislate and how much to legislate. Thus, to decide the  timing, content and extent of legislation is a function primarily  entrusted to the legislature and in exercise of judicial review, the  Court starts with a basic presumption in favour of the proper  exercise of such power.                                     14   14.   Generally, the heads of income to be subjected to taxability  under the 1961 Act are enumerated in Section 14 which starts  with a saving clause and expressly predicates that profits and  gains of business or profession shall be chargeable to income tax.  This general declaration of chargeability is followed by Section  145, which prescribes the method of accounting and reads thus:          “Method of accounting         145. (1) Income chargeable under the head ""Profits and         gains of business or profession"" or ""Income from other         sources"" shall, subject to the provisions of sub­section         (2), be computed in accordance with either cash or         mercantile system of accounting regularly employed by         the assessee.         (2) The Central Government may notify in the Official         Gazette from time to time accounting standards to be         followed by any class of assessees or in respect of any         class of income.         (3) Where the Assessing Officer is not satisfied about the         correctness or completeness of the accounts of the         assessee, or where the method of accounting provided in         sub­section (1) or accounting standards as notified under         sub­section (2), have not been regularly followed by the         assessee, the Assessing Officer may make an assessment         in the manner provided in section 144.”                                               (emphasis supplied)  15.   Sub­section (1) of Section 145 explicitly provides that the  method of accounting is a prerogative falling in the domain of the  assessee and an assessee is well within its rights to follow the  mercantile system of accounting. Be it noted that as per the  mercantile system of accounting, the assessment of income is                                  15   made on the basis of accrual of liability and not on the basis of  actual expenditure in lieu thereof. The expression “either cash or  mercantile system of accounting” offers guidance on the nature of  this accounting system. Be that as it may, it is noteworthy that  the right flowing from sub­section (1) is “subject to the provisions  of sub­section (2)”, which unambiguously empowers the Central  Government to prescribe income computation and disclosure  standards for accounting.     Concededly, sub­section (2) is an  enabling provision. It signifies that the general principle of  autonomy of the assessee in adopting a system of accounting, is  controlled by the regulation notified by the Central Government  and must be adhered to by the class of assessee governed  thereunder.  16.   Section 43B, however, is enacted to provide for deductions  to be availed by the assessee in lieu of liabilities accruing in  previous year without making actual payment to discharge the  same.    It is not a provision to place any embargo upon the  autonomy of the assessee in adopting a particular method of  accounting, nor deprives the assessee of any lawful deduction.                                 16   Instead, it merely operates as an additional condition for the  availment of deduction qua the specified head.  17.   Section 43B bears heading “certain deductions to be only on  actual payment”.   It opens with a non­obstante clause. As per  settled principles of interpretation, a non obstante clause  assumes an overriding character against any other provision of  general application. It declares that within the sphere allotted to  it by the Parliament, it shall not be controlled or overridden by  any other provision unless specifically provided for. Out of the  allowable deductions, the legislature consciously earmarked  certain deductions from time to time and included them in the  ambit of Section 43B so as to subject such deductions to  conditionality of actual payment. Such conditionality may have  the inevitable effect of being different from the theme of  mercantile system of accounting on accrual of liability basis qua  the specific head of deduction covered therein and not to other  heads. But that is a matter for the legislature and its wisdom in  doing so.  18.   The existence of Section 43B traces back to 1983 when the  legislature conceptualised the idea of such a provision in the                                      17   1961 Act. Initially, the provision included deductions in respect  of sum payable by assessee by way of tax or duty or any sum  payable by the employer by way of contribution to any provident  fund or superannuation fund. It is noteworthy that the  legislature explained the inclusion of these deductions by citing  certain practices of evasion of statutory liabilities and other  liabilities for the welfare of employees. The scope and effect of  the newly inserted provision was explained in paragraph 60 of  the Memorandum explaining the provisions of the Finance Bill,  1983 as under:          “60. … To curb this practice, it is proposed to provide         that deduction for any sum payable by the assessee by         way of tax or duty under any law for the time being in         force (irrespective of whether such tax or duty is disputed         or not) or any sum payable by the assessee as an         employer by way of contribution to any provident fund, or         superannuation fund or gratuity fund or any other fund         for the welfare of employees shall be allowed only in         computing the income of that previous year in which         such sum is actually paid by him.”  With   the   passage    of   time,   the   legislature    inserted    more  deductions to Section 43B including cess, bonus or commission  payable by employer, interest on loans payable to financial  institutions, scheduled banks etc., payment in lieu of leave  encashment by the employer and repayment of dues to the  railways. Thus understood, there is no oneness or uniformity in                                   18   the nature of deductions included in Section 43B. It holds no  merit to urge that this section only provides for deductions  concerning statutory liabilities. Section 43B is a mix bag and new  and dissimilar entries have been inserted therein from time to  time to cater to different fiscal scenarios, which are best  determined by the government of the day. It is not unusual or  abnormal for the legislature to create a new liability, exempt an  existing liability, create a deduction or subject an existing  deduction to override regulations or conditions.  19.   The leave encashment scheme envisages the payment of a  certain amount to the employees in lieu of their unused paid  leaves in a year. The nature of this payment is beneficial and pro­  employee. However, it is not in the form of a bounty and forms a  part of the conditions of service of the employee. An employer  seeking deduction from tax liability in advance, in the name of  discharging the liability of leave encashment, without actually  extending such payment to the employee as and when the time  for payment arises may lead to abhorrent consequences. When  time for such payment arises upon retirement (or otherwise) of  the   employee,   an   employer    may   simply    refuse   to   pay.  Consequently, the innocent employee will be entangled in                                  19   litigation in the evening of his/her life for claiming a hard­earned  right without any fault on his part.      Concomitantly, it would  entail in double benefit to the employer – advance deduction from  tax liability without any burden of actual payment and refusal to  pay as and when occasion arises. It is this mischief clause (f)  seeks to subjugate.  20.   The argument advanced by the respondents that the nature  of leave encashment liability is such that it is impossible to make  the actual payment in the same year, adds no weight to the claim  of invalidity of the clause. We say so because the thrust of the  provision is not to control the timing of payment, rather, it is  strictly targeted to control the timing of claiming deduction in the  name of such liability. The mischief sought to be remedied by this  clause, as discussed above, clarifies the position.  21.   Be it noted that the interpretation of a statute cannot be  unrelated to the nature of the statute. In line with other clauses  under Section 43B, clause (f) was enacted to remedy a particular  mischief and the concerns of public good, employees’ welfare and  prevention of fraud upon revenue is writ large in the said clause.  In our view, such statutes are to be viewed through the prism of                                               20   the mischief they seek to suppress, that is, the Heydon’s case8  principle.

As common question of law and facts arise in this group of cases, all these  cases are being decided together by this common judgment and order.  4.    In all these petitions, respective respondent-Colleges approached the  respective High Courts with the grievance regarding actions of approval of the  second shift by the Pharmacy Council of India (hereinafter referred to as the PCI)  and restriction on increasing the intake capacity of students for various pharmacy  courses. Since the respective respondent Colleges increased the intake of students,  based upon the requisite permission/approval obtained from the All India Council  of Technical Education (hereinafter referred to as the AICTE), the respective High                                          4   Courts have allowed the colleges to increase/continue with the increase in intake.  The respective High Courts have concluded that AICTE is the supreme authority  between the two bodies, namely, AICTE and PCI and the decision of AICTE will  prevail over the decision of PCI.     That, by the interim orders, the High Court  allowed the Institutions to continue with the increased number of intake as  approved/permitted by AICTE. That, in some of the cases, such interim orders  have been made absolute.     Therefore, the issue involved in the present batch of  cases is regarding the applicability of the Pharmacy Act, 1948 (hereinafter referred  to as the Pharmacy Act) or the All India Council of Technical Education Act, 1987  (hereinafter referred to as the AICTE Act) in relation to the subject of Pharmacy,  including approval of courses of study, minimum standards of education required  for qualification as a Pharmacist, registration as a Pharmacist, regulation of future  professional conduct etc.  SUBMISSIONS OF PCI  5.    Shri Maninder Singh, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of PCI  has vehemently submitted the following arguments:  5.1   That having regard to the statutory scheme contained in the Pharmacy Act,  which is a complete code by itself dealing with the subject of pharmacy, the  jurisdiction for regulating the standards of education in the subject of pharmacy                                          5   and subsequent professional conduct of pharmacists vests entirely in the PCI and  AICTE does not have any jurisdiction or power in this behalf.  5.2   That, as such, the issue involved in the present batch of cases is now not res  integra and is clearly covered by the decision of this Court in the case of AICTE v.  Shri Prince Shivaji Maratha Boarding House’s College of Architecture (2019)  SCC Online SC 1445 = (2019) 16 SCALE 421. It is submitted that, in the said  case, while dealing with an identical statutory scheme in the case of Council of  Architecture constituted under the Architects Act, 1972 , this Court has held that  even when the definition of “technical education” in Section 2(g) of the AICTE Act  also uses the word “architecture”, the said word would have to be dropped from the  definition of “technical education” and shall be treated as inapplicable in cases  where AICTE imports its regulatory framework.        It is further submitted that, in  that case, it is held that insofar as recognition of degrees and diplomas of  architecture education is concerned, the Architecture Act, 1972 would prevail and  that AICTE shall not be entitled to impose any regulatory measure in connection  with the degrees and diplomas in the subject of architecture. Heavy reliance has  been placed upon paragraphs 67 to 70 of the said decision.        That, in the said decision, this Court considered the entirely identical  statutory scheme contained in the Architects Act, 1972 and therefore the same  would squarely apply for interpretation of the Pharmacy Act as well.            It is                                          6   submitted that even in the case of pharmacy, the stand of AICTE is based solely  upon the user of the word “pharmacy” in the definition of “technical education” in  Section 2(g) of the AICTE Act. It is submitted that having regard to the law laid  down by this Court in the aforesaid decision, as well as the statutory scheme under  the Pharmacy Act, the said word “pharmacy” would deserve to be dropped from  the definition of “technical education” under Section 2(g) of the AICTE Act and  would deserve to be held to be inapplicable in relation to the regulatory measures  for prescribing minimum standards for education in the field of pharmacy.  5.3   That even otherwise and having regard to the statutory scheme under the  Pharmacy Act, which is a complete code and a special law in relation to subject of  pharmacy, PCI is empowered to not only regulate the profession of Pharmacy, but  also the educational institutions from which persons may obtain the qualification as  a pharmacist and that AICTE does not have any jurisdiction in that behalf.  5.4   That pharmacy is the profession of preparing, preserving, compounding and  dispensing medical drugs. It is submitted that, under the Pharmacy Act, the PCI  has been constituted as a body empowered to regulate the education and profession  of Pharmacy in India. It is submitted that PCI has been empowered to determine  and enforce the qualifications required for a person to practice as Pharmacist in  India, including approving courses of study and institutions which may offer such  courses of study to enable one to practice the profession of a pharmacist.   Relying                                           7   upon the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Pharmacy Act, it is vehemently  submitted by the learned Senior Advocate appearing for PCI that PCI is supposed  to prescribe the minimum standards of education and approve courses of study for  pharmacists.  5.5   That pharmacy is one of the several disciplines/subjects where the  Legislature has laid down that for imparting education in that subject, the  minimum standards are to be prescribed by an autonomous statutory body  comprising of eminent professionals in the field.   It is submitted that they not only  prescribe the standard of education of different courses in the discipline/subject,  they also lay down eligibility conditions for students as well as teachers, course  content, standards for evaluation of examination etc. It is submitted that they also  approve the courses in the subject in colleges/institutions on the basis of the laid  down norms by verification by inspections.     It is submitted that the law also deals  with the registration of the professionals in that discipline as well as their  subsequent conduct as registered professionals.  5.6   That it is very much important and/or necessary that the autonomous  statutory authority which is made obliged to supervise and monitor the conduct of  professionals by the Legislature in a particular discipline is also given a free hand  to decide about the standards of education, approval of courses/institutions  evaluation of standards of examination and thereafter grant of registration.                                          8   5.7   That the Legislature has clearly envisaged only one autonomous statutory  authority to undertake all these integrated functions and it is impossible to  conceive that in the same very occupied field, another statutory authority, seeks to  assume/usurp jurisdiction thereby creating unsavory practical problems, conflicts  and inconsistencies, thereby defeating the entire objective sought to be achieved by  the Special Law.  5.8   That subject of Pharmacy is a special and not a general subject. It is  submitted that it has been exhaustively dealt with by the Parliament through the  Pharmacy Act which exhaustively covers all areas inclusive of approval of courses,  laying down course content, eligibility conditions for students as well as teachers,  evaluation of standards of examination, grant of registration, taking action for any  infamous conduct etc.     It is submitted that this entire legislative objective is  achieved through the Pharmacy Act and the statutory rules and regulations made  thereunder.  5.9   That Section 10 of the Pharmacy Act empowers the PCI to frame Education  Regulations     prescribing the minimum standards of education required for  qualification as a pharmacist.    It is submitted that as per Section 10(2), such  Education Regulations may prescribe –        (a)     the nature and period of study and of practical training to be                undertaken before admission to an examination;                                           9         (b)    the equipment and facilities to be provided for students undergoing               approved courses of study;        (c)    the subjects of examination and the standards therein to be attained;        (d)    any other conditions of admission to examinations.  5.10 That the power to approve courses of study and examination is contained in  Section 12 of the Pharmacy Act. It is submitted that under this provision, any  “authority” in a State that is empowered to conduct a course of study in pharmacy  may apply to the Central Council for approval of the course in accordance with the  Education Regulations. It is further submitted that likewise, any authority which  conducts an examination in a State for pharmacy may apply to the PCI for  approval of such examination.          It is submitted that a student who has  passed/completed an approved course and passed an approved examination may  therefore be registered as a Pharmacist, subject to meeting other requirements. It is  submitted that therefore, under the Pharmacy Act, the approval of PCI in  conducting any course of pharmacy is mandatory and, in the absence of the same,  no student can be awarded the degree or diploma for such a course which makes  him entitled for registration as a pharmacist to practice the profession of pharmacy  in the country. It is submitted that Section 12(1) of the Pharmacy Act empowers  the PCI to grant approval to an Institution which conducts a “course of study” for  pharmacist. It is submitted that, as per Section 12, an application has to be made                                           10   to the Central Council seeking approval which after such enquiry, as it thinks fit to  make, that the said course of study is in conformity with the Education Regulations  envisaged under Section 10 prescribing the minimum standard of education  required for qualification as a pharmacist, shall declare the said course of study for  the purpose of admission to be an approved examination for pharmacists.  5.10.1       That Section 13 of the Pharmacy Act also empowers the Central  Council to withdraw approval accorded to the ‘course of study’ and ‘examination’  for failure to comply with the prescribed norms.  5.10.2       That Section 16 empowers the Executive Committee to appoint  inspectors to inspect any institution which provides an approved course of study or  those institutions which apply for approval of course of study or examination.  5.10.3       That Section 29 deals with the preparation and maintenance of a  register of pharmacists. Section 35 provides for entry of additional qualifications  in the register in relation to any registered pharmacist. Section 36 provides for the  removal of any person from the register, either permanently or for a temporary  period.   That it is evident therefore that PCI does not just regulate the provisions  itself, but also plays a vital role in regulating entry into the profession by approving  the courses and examination which constitute appropriate qualifications to be  registered as a pharmacist under Section 32(2). It is submitted that under Section  42 of the Pharmacy Act, a person may not practice the profession of pharmacy                                          11   unless he or she is registered as a pharmacist in accordance with the Pharmacy Act  and Section 42(2) is a penal provision which states that any person who is not a  registered pharmacist and contravenes Section 42(1) shall be punishable with  imprisonment for a term which may extend to six months, or with fine not  exceeding one thousand rupees or with both.  5.11 That in exercise of powers vested in it under the Pharmacy Act, the PCI has  framed a number of Regulations for prescribing minimum standards of education  as well as regulating the subject of pharmacy in India, including:-        a.     Education Regulations, 1991;       b.     Pharm. D. Regulations, 2008;       c.     Minimum Qualifications for Teachers in Pharmacy Institutions              Regulations, 2014;        d.     Bachelor of Pharmacy (B. Pharm) Course Regulations, 2014;        e.     Master of Pharmacy (M.Pharm) Course Regulations, 2014;        f.     Bachelor of Pharmacy (Practice) Regulations, 2014;        g.     Pharmacy Practice Regulations, 2015.  5.12 That the aforesaid statutory scheme clearly demonstrates that the field of  Pharmacy is fully occupied with all details and is all pervasive. It is submitted that  it is fully covered and governed not only by the provisions of the Pharmacy Act,  but also supplemented by the statutory Rules and statutory Regulations made  thereunder; thereby providing a complete code on the subject of Pharmacy.                                          12   5.13 That the legislative intent in enacting the Pharmacy Act was to ensure that  there is seamless regulation of the profession, both in terms of the qualifications  required to be registered as a pharmacist and the actual practice of pharmacy as a  profession.    It is submitted that the same scheme has been adopted by the  Parliament with respect to, inter alia, the legal profession (Bar Council of India),  medical profession (Medical Council of India), architects (Architecture Council of  India), nursing (Nurses Council of India) and dentistry (Dental Council of India).  It is submitted that therefore the Pharmacy Act is a special law dealing with the  subject/field of pharmacy.  5.14 That, on the other hand, the AICTE Act is merely to ensure that the  standards are maintained in the area of technical education and that it is not  intended to take over all aspects of the regulation of specialized education in India  for which specialized regulatory bodies already operate under their respective laws.  It is submitted that a perusal of the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the  AICTE Act demonstrates that AICTE had been for assisting and guiding the  Central Government in relation to policies on the subject of engineering and  similar technical subjects.   That it has not been created to dilute, in any manner  whatsoever, the autonomy and authority of other statutory bodies. It is submitted  that it does not oversee any course which requires registration of professionals and                                          13   their conduct. That it has no jurisdiction whatsoever on the subject of medicine,  dentistry, architecture as well as pharmacy.  5.15 That the scope of powers of the AICTE and the legislative intent behind the  AICTE Act has been explained by this Court in the case of Bharathidasan  University v. All-India Council for Technical Education (2001) 8 SCC 676.  Heavy reliance has been placed on Paragraphs 8 and 10.  5.16 That therefore the legislative intent behind the AICTE Act is therefore clear.  It is not intended to replace or supersede existing regulatory bodies, but rather was  intended to focus on coordinating and improving the standards of technical  education across the country in an advisory capacity. It is submitted that therefore  in the regulation of Pharmacy education, PCI continues to be the regulator of the  educational institutions under the Pharmacy Act. That in relation to regulation of  educational institutions in the field of Pharmacy, the provisions of the Pharmacy  Act being a Special Law dealing with the subject of “Pharmacy” would prevail  over the AICTE Act, being a General Law for “technical education”.  5.17 That even otherwise the Pharmacy Act being a special law on the subject of  Pharmacy would prevail over the AICTE Act. It is submitted that it is a settled  position of law that a special law dealing with any subject would prevail over the  general law which may be dealing with the said subject only incidentally.       That  this principle of law is also enshrined in the maxim generalia specialibus non                                           14   derogant. It is submitted that it is an exception to the principle that a latter statute  would prevail over an earlier statute.       It is submitted that therefore an earlier  Special Law would prevail over a later General Law.           In support of the above  submissions, heavy reliance has been placed upon the decisions of this Court in the  cases of UPSEB v. Hari Shanker Jain (1978) 4 SCC 16; LIC of India v. D.J.  Bahadur (1981) 1 SCC 315 and Yakub Abdul Razak Memon v. State of  Maharashtra (2013) 13 SCC 1.  5.18 Relying upon the above decisions, it is urged that even in case of any  conflict, the Pharmacy Act being a special law dealing with the special subject of  pharmacy would prevail over the AICTE Act being a general law in the field of  technical education.  5.19 That even the submission on behalf of the respondents based on the principle  of ‘implied repeal’ are entirely misconceived and erroneous. It is submitted that it  has been held by this Court in the case of Municipal Council v. T.J. Joseph (1964)  2 SCR 87 that when two laws are made by the Legislature at different points of  time, dealing with the same subject matter, there is no presumption that the later  law impliedly repeals the earlier law. Heavy reliance is also placed upon the  decision of this Court in Byram Prestonji Gariwala v. Union Bank of India  (1992) 1 SCC 31. That in the aforesaid decision, it is held by this Court that any  fundamental change/alteration in law cannot be presumed by applying the principle                                          15   of “implied repeal”. That it is held that any fundamental change/alteration in law,  can only be carried out by explicit words, and not “by a sidewind”. That therefore,  in the aforesaid decision, the contention based on the principle of “implied repeal”  has been rejected.  5.19.1        That        therefore    having        regard       to      the  Statement of Objects and Reasons as well as the scheme of the AICTE Act, as also  explained in para 8 of the judgment in Bharthidarsan case (supra), it is abundantly  clear that the Parliament has not intended to fundamentally alter the existing  regime where – from the stage of prescribing the minimum standards of education,  approving the courses of study to the stage of registration and future monitoring of  professional conduct of pharmacist the Pharmacy Act vests the PCI with such  jurisdiction and power.  5.19.2        That as such the AICTE Act cannot be treated to have, in any manner  whatsoever, affected the jurisdiction and power of the PCI in this behalf. It is  submitted that therefore AICTE Act cannot be held to have “implied repealed” the  Pharmacy Act and any contention to the contrary would deserve to be rejected by  this Court.  5.19.3        That in the absence of any express or implied legislative intent, the  AICTE Act cannot be held to have repealed the Pharmacy Act and on the contrary,                                          16   the provisions of the Pharmacy Act, being a special law dealing comprehensively  with the subject of Pharmacy, would prevail over the AICTE Act.  5.20 This Court while disposing of SLP (c) Diary No. 24798 of 2018 –  Progressive Education Society’s College of Pharmacy v. State of Maharashtra  (dated 24.07.2018) has observed that “it is desirable that the Government of India  should revisit the definition in Section 2(g) of the AICTE Act. Whether there  could have been inclusion of pharmacy when it was already converted by the  Pharmacy Act”. It is submitted that in fact thereafter in a inter-Ministerial meeting  held on 30.09.2019 between the Minister of Health and Family Welfare,  Government of India and Minister of HRD, Government of India, a decision has  been taken that the word “pharmacy” would be deleted from the definition of  “technical education” under the AICTE Act. However, the said amendment is still  to be carried out.    It is submitted that even the proposed Higher Education  Commission of India Bill, 2019, which seeks to repeal the UGC and AICTE Acts  and the Allied and Healthcare Professions Bill, 2018, which seeks to bring into  existence a regulatory mechanism for 53 allied and healthcare professions such as  physiotherapists, radiologists, nutritionists etc., have no relation whatsoever with  the PCI. It is submitted that all the four Councils dealing with Medicine, Dentistry,  Pharmacy and Nursing would continue to discharge their respective duties and  activities under special enactments.                                          17   5.21 That the submission of the respondent Colleges and the AICTE Act to the  effect that PCI can regulate only the grant of Diploma in Pharmacy and not the  further courses/qualifications, is absolutely erroneous, misconceived and  unsustainable in law in view of the specific provisions under Sections 12 and 35 of  the Pharmacy Act. It is submitted that Sections 12 and 35 makes it abundantly  clear that it is all courses in relation to pharmacy which get covered by the scheme  of the Pharmacy Act.  5.22 That the primary reason of conflict between the AICTE and PCI was on  account of AICTE permitting colleges to double the intake capacity for courses  where the intake capacity had been fixed by the PCI, and also on account of  AICITE permitting the second shift (evening classes) contrary to the regulations of  PCI.  5.23 That even recently a public notice has been issued by the AICTE which  informs that AICTE is still inviting applications for grant of approval for courses of  Architecture, despite the decision of this Court in Shri Prince Shivaji Maratha  Boarding House’s College of Architecture (supra). That therefore even the said  public notice is in the teeth of this Court’s judgment and order and the same is  nothing but deliberate disobedience of the decision of this Court.  5.24 Making the above submissions and relying upon the above decisions, it is  prayed to allow the present petitions and hold that the PCI possesses the                                          18   jurisdiction and power to regulate the education as well as practice of profession of  pharmacy in relation to all its aspects and AICTE would not have any jurisdiction  or power in that regard.    It is also prayed to hold that the word “pharmacy” in  Section 2(g) of the AICTE Act deserves to be treated as inapplicable in relation to  the regulation of education and practice of profession in pharmacy.  SUBMISSIONS OF AICTE  6.    Shri Harish Panday, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the AICTE has  raised the following submissions:  6.1   That AICTE was originally set up in the year 1945 by a Government  resolution as a National Expert Body to advise Central and State Government for  ensuring the coordinated development and technical education in accordance with  approved standards and was playing effective role. It is submitted that taking into  account the growing erosion of standard and pursuant to recommendation, a  National Working Group was set up in November 1985 to look into the role of  AICTE.     In order to enable the AICTE to play its role effectively, it was  recommended that council should be given the statutory power. The National  Policy of Education 1986 also stipulated that Council will be vested with statutory  power. A Bill was introduced to ensure proper planning and coordinated  development of Technical Education system in the country. It is submitted that the  AICTE Act has been enacted with an object to provide for the establishment of an                                          19   AICTE with a view to proper planning and coordinated development of the  technical education system throughout the country; the promotion of qualitative  improvement of such education in relation to planned quantitative growth and the  regulation and proper maintenance of norms and standards in the technical  education system and for matters connected therewith. It is submitted that the  power and functions assigned to AICTE is not only to prescribe norms and  standards but to inspect, approve and withhold recognition of programmes and  institutes.  6.2    That Section 2(g) of the AICTE Act defines ‘technical education” and it  includes “pharmacy”. Learned counsel on behalf of AICTE has taken us through  various provisions of the AICTE Act and it is submitted that therefore the AICTE  Act has been enacted for regulating and fixing minimum standard for technical  education and education institutions in the field of technical education, as defined  in Section 2(g) of the AICTE Act.      It is submitted that the AICTE Act has been  given all powers for fixing the minimum qualification and standards and regulating  institutions and in case of failure to comply with its rules and regulations, power to  take action, including withdrawal of the approval.  6.3    That so far as the Pharmacy Act is concerned it is a pre-Constitution Act  which was enacted in the year 1948 with the primary object to make better  provisions for regulation of the profession and practice of pharmacy and for that                                         20   purpose to constitute Pharmacy Council. It is submitted that perusal of the object,  aim and provisions of the Pharmacy Act makes it clear that the Pharmacy Act  which is a prior Act has been primarily enacted to regulate the professionals only.  It is submitted that in the year 1987, AICTE has been given the statutory status  with the sole authority to regulate and prescribe minimum norms and standard for  Technical Education and technical instructions as defined under the AICTE Act. It  is submitted that after coming into AICTE Act, it is entirely within the domain of  the AICTE Council to grant approval to a new course or to recognize a new  institute.  6.4    That the Legislature in its own wisdom has included Pharmacy in the  definition of ‘technical education’ in the AICTE Act and given AICTE powers to  maintain the norms and standard of technical education for proper and coordinated  development of technical education.  6.5    That the language of AICTE Act is plain and unambiguous and therefore the  court shall not interpret the same in a different manner only because a harsh  consequence arising therefrom. Reliance is placed upon the case of Nasiruddin v.  Sita Ram Agarwal (2003) 2 SCC 577.  6.6    That deleting the word “Pharmacy” from AICTE Act which has specifically  been incorporated by the Legislature will amount to legislate which is not  permissible, as held by this Court in the case of Union of India v. Deoki Nandan                                           21   Aggarwal (1992) Supp. 1 SCC 323. It is submitted that, as held by this Court, the  courts cannot rewrite, recast or reframe the legislation.  6.7   That as held by this Court in the case of Ajeet Singh Singhvi v. State of  Rajasthan 1991 Suppl. (1) SCC 343, the courts should always presume that the  Legislature inserted every part of the statute for a purpose and the legislative  intention is that every part of the statute should have effect. It is further submitted  that as held by this Court in the case of Ajoy Kumar Banerjee v. Union of India  (1984) 3 SCC 127, the later law will prevail.      It is submitted that therefore the  AICTE Act, which is a later Act, shall prevail over the Pharmacy Act.  6.8   That Article 372 of the Constitution provides that notwithstanding the repeal  by the Constitution of the enactments referred to in Article 395, all the laws that  were in force in the territory of India immediately before the commencement of the  Constitution shall continue to remain in f"

The moot question in this appeal emanating from the            judgment and order dated 19.11.2018 in Writ Petition No.            39418/2018 passed by the High Court of Judicature at            Hyderabad for the State of Telangana and the State of Andhra            Pradesh1 is: whether the High Court in exercise of its writ            jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India ought Signature Not Verified  Digitally signed by            to entertain a challenge to the assessment order on the sole DEEPAK SINGH Date: 2020.05.06 16:03:16 IST Reason:               1 For short, “the High Court”                                             2   ground that the statutory remedy of appeal against that order  stood foreclosed by the law of limitation?  3.     The respondent is a registered dealer on the rolls of  Assistant Commissioner of Commercial Taxes, Large Tax Payer  Unit at Kakinada Division2 under the provisions of Andhra  Pradesh Value Added Tax Act, 2005 3 and the Central Sales Tax  Act, 19564 and is engaged in the business of manufacturing and  sale of Horlicks, Boost, Biscuits, Ghee, Ayurvedic Medicines etc.  The Assistant Commissioner had called upon the respondent to  produce books of accounts for the assessment year 2013­14 for  finalisation of assessment under the 1956 Act. The authorised  representative of the respondent produced declaration in Form  “F” in support of its claim that certain transactions are inter­  State transfers.        The information and declaration furnished by  the respondent was duly verified and after giving personal  hearing to the respondent, final assessment order came to be  passed by the Assistant Commissioner on 21.6.2017, raising  demand of Rs.76,73,197/­ (Rupees seventy six lakhs seventy  three thousand one hundred ninety seven only) against turnover   2 For short, “the Assistant Commissioner” 3 For short, ”the 2005 Act” 4 For short, “the 1956 Act”                                            3   of Rs.3,44,15,240/­ (Rupees three crores forty four lakhs fifteen  thousand two hundred forty only) on the finding that the  respondent had failed to submit Form “F” to the tune of the  turnover reported in the Central Sales Tax (CST) return.                           This  assessment order was duly served on the respondent on  22.6.2017.        The respondent did not file appeal against this  assessment order within the statutory period. Instead, amount  equivalent to 12.5% of the demand was deposited on 12.9.2017.  The respondent then filed an application under Rule 60 of the  Andhra Pradesh Value Added Tax Rules, 2005 5, highlighting the  error made in raising the demand based on incorrect turnover  reported by the respondent. This application was filed only on  8.5.2018,      which       came      to   be     rejected     by    the     Assistant  Commissioner vide order dated 11.5.2018.                        Aggrieved by the  decision dated 11.5.2018, the respondent filed an appeal before  the Appellate Deputy Commissioner of Commercial Taxes,  Vijayawada6 on 28.5.2018, which came to be rejected on  17.8.2018.       It is only thereafter, the respondent­assessee was  advised to file appeal before the Appellate Deputy Commissioner   5 For short, “the 2005 Rules” 6 For short, “the Appellate Deputy Commissioner” or “the appellate authority”, as the case may be”                                  4   on 24.9.2018 against the assessment order dated 21.6.2017. In  the meantime, another assessment order came to be passed on  31.3.2018 in relation to the Audit taken up for the tax period  from 1.4.2013 to 31.3.2017. We are not concerned with the said  order in the present appeal.  4.   Reverting to the appeal filed by the respondent against the  assessment order dated 21.6.2017, the same was dismissed on  25.10.2018 being barred by limitation and also because no  sufficient cause was made out. The respondent was then advised  to file writ petition before the High Court being Writ Petition No.  39418/2018, solely for quashing and setting aside of assessment  order dated 21.6.2017 for tax period – April, 2013 to March, 2014  (CST) being contrary to law, without jurisdiction and in violation  of principles of natural justice to the extent of levy on the Branch  Transfer turnovers and to direct the Assistant Commissioner (CT)  to re­do the assessment and reckon the correct Branch Transfer  turnover and grant exemption on the basis of Form “F”.          The  respondent did not challenge the order passed by the Appellate  Deputy Commissioner, rejecting the statutory appeal preferred by  the respondent against the assessment order dated 21.6.2017,                                 5   for reasons best known to the respondent. The Division Bench of  the High Court, on 8.11.2018, noted that the respondent had  already paid 12.5% of the disputed tax, for the purpose of filing  an appeal. It also noted the stand taken by the respondent that  the employee who was in charge of the tax matters of the  respondent, had defaulted and was subsequently suspended in  contemplation of disciplinary proceedings, as a result of which  statutory appeal could not be filed within the prescribed time.  The Division Bench of the High Court directed the respondent to  pay an additional amount equivalent to 12.5% of the disputed tax  within one week and posted the matter for 19.11.2018. This was  an ex­parte order. The respondent, in terms of the stated order,  deposited an additional amount equivalent to 12.5% of the  disputed tax amount. The writ petition was then taken up for  hearing on 19.11.2018, when after hearing the counsel for the  parties, the writ petition came to be allowed and the order passed  by the Assistant Commissioner, dated 21.6.2017 has been  quashed and set aside and the respondent relegated before the  Assistant Commissioner for reconsideration of the matter afresh  after giving personal hearing to the respondent to explain the  discrepancies. This order has also noted that the respondent had                                   6   paid Rs.9,59,190/­ (Rupees nine lakhs fifty­nine thousand one  hundred ninety only) equivalent to the 12.5% of the taxes in the  year 2013­14 (CST) on 13.11.2018.  5.       Feeling aggrieved, the appellants have filed the present  appeal. It is urged that the respondent having failed to avail of  statutory remedy of appeal within the prescribed time and also  because the delay in filing appeal had not been satisfactorily  explained, the High Court ought not to have entertained the writ  petition at the instance of such person and moreso, because the  respondent had allowed the order passed by the appellate  authority rejecting the appeal on the ground of delay to become  final.     In substance, the argument is that the High Court  exceeded its jurisdiction and committed manifest error in setting  aside the assessment order dated 21.6.2017 passed by the  Assistant Commissioner.  6.       The respondent, on the other hand, would urge that the  High Court has had ample power under Article 226 of the  Constitution of India to grant relief to the respondent considering  the peculiar facts of the present case being an exceptional  situation which if not remedied, would result in failure of justice.                                      7   7.   We have heard Mr. G.N. Reddy, learned counsel for the  appellants and Mr. V. Lakshmikumaran, learned counsel for the  respondent.  8.   From     the   indisputable     facts,   it   is   evident   that   the  assessment order dated 21.6.2017 was challenged by the  respondent by way of statutory appeal before the Appellate  Deputy Commissioner only on 24.9.2018. Section 31 of the 2005  Act provides for the statutory remedy against an assessment  order. The same, as applicable at the relevant time, reads thus: ­         “31. (1) Any VAT dealer or TOT dealer or any other        dealer objecting to any order passed or proceeding        recorded by any authority under the provisions of the Act        other than an order passed or proceeding recorded by an        Additional Commissioner or Joint Commissioner or        Deputy Commissioner, may within thirty days from the        date on which the order or proceeding was served on him,        appeal to such authority as may be prescribed:               Provided that the appellate authority may within a        further period of thirty days admit the appeal preferred        after a period of thirty days if he is satisfied that the VAT        dealer or TOT dealer or any other dealer had sufficient        cause for not preferring the appeal within that period:               Provided further that an appeal so preferred shall        not be admitted by the appellate authority concerned        unless the dealer produces the proof of payment of tax,        penalty, interest or any other amount admitted to be due,        or of such instalments as have been granted, and the        proof of payment of twelve and half percent of the        difference of the tax, penalty, interest or any other        amount, assessed by the authority prescribed and the        tax, penalty, interest or any other amount admitted by        the appellant, for the relevant tax period, in respect of        which the appeal is preferred.                              8   (2)  The appeal shall be in such form, and verified in such manner, as may be prescribed and shall be accompanied by a fee which shall not be less than Rs.50/­ (Rupees fifty only) but shall not exceed Rs.1000/­ (Rupees one thousand only) as may be prescribed. (3)    (a) Where an appeal is admitted under sub­section (1), the appellate authority may, on an application filed by the appellant and subject to furnishing of such security or on payment of such part of the disputed tax within such time as may be specified, order stay of collection of balance of the tax under dispute pending disposal of the appeal;   (b) Against an order passed by the appellate   authority refusing to order stay under clause (a), the   appellant may prefer a revision petition within thirty   days from the date of the order of such refusal to the   Additional Commissioner or the Joint Commissioner   who may subject to such terms and conditions as he   may think fit, order stay of collection of balance of the   tax under dispute pending disposal of the appeal by   the appellate authority;   (c) Notwithstanding anything in clauses (a) or (b),   where a VAT dealer or TOT dealer or any other dealer   has preferred an appeal to the Appellate Tribunal   under Section 33, the stay, if any, ordered under   clause (b) shall be operative till the disposal of the   appeal by such Tribunal, and, the stay, if any ordered   under clause (a) shall be operative till the disposal of   the appeal by such Tribunal, only in case where the   Additional Commissioner or the Joint Commissioner   on an application made to him by the dealer in the   prescribed manner, makes specific order to that effect. (4)   The appellate authority may, within a period of two years from the date of admission of such appeal, after giving the appellant an opportunity of being heard and subject to such rules as may be prescribed:          (a) confirm, reduce, enhance or annul             the          assessment or the penalty, or both; or          (b) set aside the assessment or penalty, or both,          and direct the authority prescribed to pass a          fresh order after such further enquiry as may be          directed; or          (c) pass such other orders as it may think fit.                                      9           (4A) Where any proceeding under this section has been         deferred on account of any stay orders granted by the         High Court or Supreme Court in any case or by reason of         the fact that an appeal or other proceeding is pending         before the High Court or the Supreme Court involving a         question of law having a direct bearing on the order or         proceeding in question, the period during which the stay         order is in force or the period during which such appeal         or proceeding is pending, shall be excluded, while         computing the period of two years specified in sub­section         (4) for the purpose of passing appeal order under this         section.         (5)   Before passing orders under sub­section (4), the         appellate authority may make such enquiry as it deems         fit or remand the case to any subordinate officer or         authority for an inquiry and report on any specified point         or points.         (6)    Every order passed in appeal under this section         shall, subject to the provisions of sections 32, 33, 34 and         35 be final.”  Going by the text of this provision, it is evident that the statutory  appeal is required to be filed within 30 days from the date on  which the order or proceeding was served on the assessee. If the  appeal is filed after expiry of prescribed period, the appellate  authority is empowered to condone the delay in filing the appeal,  only if it is filed within a further period of not exceeding 30 days  and sufficient cause for not preferring the appeal within  prescribed time is made out.             The appellate authority is not  empowered to condone delay beyond the aggregate period of 60  days from the date of order or service of proceeding on the  assessee, as the case may be. In the present case, admittedly,                                       10   the appeal was filed way beyond the total 60 days’ period  specified in terms of Section 31 of the 2005 Act.               In that, the  respondent had filed the appeal accompanied by an application  for condonation of delay setting out reasons in the following  words: ­             “2. It is submitted that the impugned Order­in­Original            dated 21.06.2017 was received by the Applicant on            22.06.2017 and the appeal ought to have been filed by            the applicant on 21.07.2017 in terms of section 31 of the            Andhra Pradesh VAT Act, 2005. Thus, there is delay in            filing the appeal. The Applicants further submits that the            delay is not due to any negligence on part of the            Applicant.            3.    It is submitted that the impugned order was            received by Mr. P. Sriram Murthy, but the receipt of this            assessment order was not informed to any other person            of the company.            4.   Mr. P. Sriram Murthy was authorized to handle day            to day affairs of sales tax (VAT), service tax and excise            and he was also authorized to sign and submit            documents with the tax departments, file periodic tax            returns and represent the company before Concerned tax            authorities.            5.    However, the company has alleged Mr. P. Sriram            Murthy with committing certain irregularities for past            more than 12 months and initiated disciplinary            proceedings against him. He has been suspended from            his official duties with effect from 26th July 2018.            6.     It is only post his suspension that the Applicant            came to know about the receipt of impugned order. Also,            the Appellant has come to know that Mr. Murthy paid the            12.5% of the demand amount on 12.09.2017 as if it is a            regular tax payment. Further, since he did not file the            appeal in time, therefore to protect himself from the            disciplinary action, he adopted alternate route and filed            rectification application under rule 60 which is not            permissible under law in case demand has been raised            on technical grounds.                                       11            7.    A separate affidavit as to the facts of the case is also          attached herewith.          8.     It is stated that in view of the facts and          circumstances mentioned above and in the attached          affidavit, your honor would appreciate that the delay in          filing the appeal is completely unintentional and for the          bona fide reasons stated above. The applicant company          should not be imposed with tax liabilities due to inaction          and malafide intention on one employee. The Applicants          further submit that if the delay in filing the above          numbered appeal is not condoned, the Applicant would          be put to great injustice and irreparable injury. On the          other hand, no prejudice would be caused if the delay is          condoned.                WHEREFORE, it is prayed that the Ld. Appellate          Joint Commissioner (ST) be pleased to allow the          application for condonation of delay as prayed for.”  As stated in the application for condonation of delay in filing the  statutory appeal, the respondent caused to file affidavit of  Mr. Sreedhar Routh, son of Late Mr. R. Seetha Rama Swamy,  who was working as Site Director in the respondent company. In  this affidavit, in support of the application for condonation of  delay, it is averred thus: ­           “…..          That Mr. P. Sriram Murthy, Deputy Manager­Finance,          was authorized to handle day to day affairs of sales tax          (VAT), service tax and excise. He was also authorized to          sign and submit documents with the tax departments,          file periodic tax returns and represent the company          before concerned tax authorities.          that the CST assessment for the period 2013­14 was          completed by the Assistant Commissioner (CT) LTU          raising demand of Rs.76,73,197/­ vide assessment order          dated 21.06.2017.                                     12           that the assessment order was received by Mr. P. Sriram         Murthy. But, the receipt of this assessment order was not         informed to any other person of the company.         that Mr. P. Sriram Murthy filed application under Rule 60         of the Andhra Pradesh Act, 2005 without informing the         company about such filing.         that Mr. P. Sriram Murthy also engaged a Chartered         Accountant and filed an appeal against rejection of         application filed under rule 60. The appointment of         Chartered Accountant and filing this appeal was also not         informed to the company.         that the company has alleged Mr. P. Sriram Murthy with         committing     certain    irregularities and  initiated         disciplinary proceedings against him.         that Mr. P. Sriram Murthy has been suspended from his         official duties with effect from 26th July 2018.         Investigation in this matter is going on.         that it is only post his suspension that we have come to         know about the demand of Rs.76,73,197/­ lakhs raised         vide CST assessment order for the year 2013­2014 and         therefore could not respond or take any action in respect         of this order/demand.         It is prayed that the Ld. Appellate Joint Commissioner         (ST) be pleased to allow the application for condonation of         delay as prayed for.""  The appellate authority vide order dated 25.10.2018, considered  the reasons offered by the respondent for the delay in filing of the  appeal and concluded that the same were not substantiated with  sufficient cause. On that finding including that the delay beyond  the period of 60 days from the date of service of the assessment  order on the respondent­assessee cannot be condoned, the  appellate authority observed thus: ­                             13      “However, to abide the principles of natural justice, the appellant has been issued notices dated 03.10.2018 and 19.10.2018 to appear for admission hearings to be held on 10.10.2018 and 25.10.2018 respectively, in the office of Appellate Deputy Commissioner (CT), Vijayawada for explaining reasons and his contentions in support of the admission of appeal petition. The A.R. appeared for the admission hearing on 25.10.2018 and prayed for admission of appeal petition, but not submitted any reliable grounds and substantial documentary evidence in support of their submission that they were unaware of the receipt of original assessment order.    It is further pertinent here to record that after receiving the original assessment order, the appellant­ dealer has filed a request letter before the assessing authority for re­assessment under rule 60 of APVAT Rules, 2005. However, the AA has not considered re­ assessment request, and issued an endorsement dt.11.05.2018, rejecting the re­assessment request. The appellant also filed an appeal on such endorsement. That appeal petition based on endorsement has also not been admitted in this office and rejected vide ADC’s orders no. 3470, dt. 17.08.2018. Therefore, cannot be assumed under any circumstances, and by no stretch of imagination that the appellant­dealer was not aware of the service of original assessment orders. Hence, it is to be affirmed that the causes put­forth for delay condonation are not rational and against the facts of the case. It is also relevant here to state that whatever may be circumstances, the delay beyond 60 days could not be condonable in the hands of the appellate authority, therefore, such request prima­facie is not in tune with the provisions of the Act, hence, liable to be rejected.    From the aforesaid discussion, it is construed that no favourable grounds can be made to admit the appeal, since the appellant have failed to file appeal petition within the prescribed time under APVAT Act, 2005. It is also pertinent here to note that the Department has duly served the original assessment order to the appellant without any procedural lapse, and also the appellant has admitted that the original orders were received on 22.06.2017.   In view of the above, since the appellant failed to prefer an appeal on the original assessment order dated 21.06.2017, which was duly served on the appellant, and                                     14           as such the original assessment order has become final,         and the present appeal filed by the appellant on         24.09.2018 with a delay of 1 year 62 days, hence cannot         be admitted.            Further the appellants have not submitted any         valid reasons/sufficient cause for not preferring the         appeal within the prescribed & condonable time of         30+30=60 days of receipt of the original assessment         order. Hence the appeal petition is hereby REJECTED         as per the provisions of Section 31 of APVAT Act.”                                                (emphasis supplied)  The appellate authority was pleased to reject the explanation that  the respondent was not aware of the service of assessment order,  as it remained unsubstantiated by the respondent.                When the  matter travelled to the High Court, the Division Bench, after  hearing the respondent, proceeded to pass an ex­parte order on  8.11.2018, which reads thus: ­                                   “ORDER:            It is represented by Mr. S. Dwarakanath, learned         counsel for the petitioner that the petitioner has already         paid 12.5% of the disputed tax, for the purpose of filing         an appeal. But, the employee, who was incharge and who         was subsequently, suspended in contemplation of         disciplinary proceedings, failed to file the appeal. The         contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner is that         the issue lies in a narrow campus.            Since the petitioner has already paid 12.5% of the         disputed tax, the request of the petitioner for granting         one more opportunity would be considered favourably, if         the petitioner pays an additional amount equivalent to         12.5% of the disputed tax. The petitioner shall make         such payment within a period of one week.           Post on 19.11.2018 for orders.”                                        15   Be it noted that the respondent was advised to file writ petition  merely for setting aside of the assessment order dated 21.6.2017,  presumably, in light of the decision of Full bench of the same  High Court in Electronics Corporation of India Ltd. vs. Union  of India & Ors.7.   9.     We may advert to the assertions made in the writ petition  (on the basis of which the High Court was pleased to grant relief  to the respondent), to explain the delay in filing of the statutory  appeal including the reason why the respondent should be given  one opportunity. The same read thus: ­             “…..            7.    From the above, it can be summarized that the total            disputed demand has arisen on account of two reasons.            Firstly, the 1st Respondent has considered the total            branch transfer turnover as per monthly CST returns            and ignored the revised turnover as per VAT 200­B. Even            though, the such revised stock transfer value was            considered by the 1st Respondent while computing the            ITC credit as per rule 20 (8) of AP VAT act. Secondly,            receipt of excess forms on account of inclusion of value of            freebies, free samples etc. by receiving state while issuing            the F Forms. The 1st Respondent treated these excess F            Forms value as concealment by the petitioner and levied            tax even, on this branch transfer value duly covered by F            Forms which is [sic] grossly against the principle of law.            8.    It is submitted that the order was served on the            petitioner on 22.6.2017 against which, the Petitioner            could have preferred appeal before the 2nd Respondent            within 30 days from the said date. Unfortunately, no            steps were taken to file any appeal within the due date            for the reason that the day to day affairs of the Sales Tax, 7 2018 (361) ELT 22(A.P.)                             16   Service Tax and Excise Law was being handled by one Mr. P. Sri Ram Murthy, who was working as Deputy Manager (Finance) in the Company, who failed to take ‘appropriate steps to prefer an appeal within time, by his negligence. Excepting Mr. P. Sri Ram Murthy, there was no other person who was well conversant with the facts and the steps to be taken against the assessment order. The other person Mr. Siddhant Belgaonker, Senior Manager (Finance) who attended the assessment hearing also left the services of the Petitioner on 31.1.2018. Consequently,     the    assessment     order    remained uncontested. 9.     It is respectfully submitted that apart from this act of negligence, Mr. P. Sri Ram Murthy also committed certain other irregularities over a period of one year, which came to the light of the Management of the Company in the month of July, 2018. Immediately, disciplinary proceedings were initiated against him, by issuing a notice on 26.7.2018 (ex. P­3) and also suspending him from official duties with immediate effect. 10. It is submitted that the Petitioner was not aware of the impugned order since that fact was not brought to the notice by its own employee, due to this negligence. 11. It appears, the said Mr. P. Sri Ram Murthy having realized his negligence, made further mistake, by filing an application under Rule 60 of the APVAT Rules read with Rule 14­A(10) of the CST (AP) Rules on 9.5.2018 (Ex. P­4) contending, inter­alia, that the revised value of stock transfer as per VAT 200­B should have been considered instead    of    Rs.866,25,15,490/­.      In    the    said representation, it is claimed that it has filed revised returns under the VAT Act, disclosing the correct ‘F’ form turnover for the purposes of restricting the input tax credit while filing Form 200­B at the end of the year. The ITC credit under VAT was also allowed by the 1 st Respondent, considering the stock transfer turnover as Rs.863,33,95,259/­. In the said representation, it was contended that the turnover of Rs.1,85,03,360/­, could not have been levied with the tax since it is admittedly covered by ‘F’ forms. 12. The representation of the Petitioner under Rule 60 was rejected by the 1st Respondent, by endorsement, dated 11.5.2018 (Ex. P­5) on the ground, that it is not a case for considering it as a mistake rectifiable under Rule 60. It is also submitted that Mr. P. Sri Ram Murthy                             17   appear to have filed an appeal against the endorsement of the 1st Respondent dated 11.5.2018 to 2nd Respondent on 28.5.2018. This was also without knowledge of the petitioner’s management. 13. It is submitted that the Petitioner was not aware of these developments till the misdeeds of Mr. P. Sri Ram Murthy were being enquired into. It is submitted that Mr. P. Sri Ram Murthy has in fact, remitted an amount of Rs.9,59,150/­ being 12.5% of the disputed tax in the assessment order online, on 12.9.2017 (Ex. P­6). The payment was made as if it is towards miscellaneous tax payment for June, 2014. When the Petitioner was seeking to reconcile as to how this amount was deposited and under what account it came to known it is for the purpose of preferring an appeal against the impugned order. All this verification happened post suspension of Mr. P. Sri Ram Murthy. 14. The Petitioner faced with this unfortunate situation, filed an appeal under Section 31 of the VAT Act on 24.9.2018 on the bona fide belief that there are good grounds for condonation of the delay since the Petitioner cannot suffer for the errors committed by one of its employees. 15. It is submitted that the 2nd Respondent, vide order, dated 25.10.2018 (Ex. P­7), rejected the appeal on the ground that he has no power to condone the delay beyond 30 days. It is also observed in the said order that appeal against the Endorsement was also dismissed by him on 17.8.2018. However, copy of the order is not yet served on the petitioner. The 2nd Respondent observed that the Petitioner cannot dispute the service of assessment order on 22.6.2017 and failure to file the appeal within 60 days would mean that the assessment order has attained finality. 16. The petitioner submits that filing of a further appeal to the APVAT Appellate Tribunal at Visakhapatnam is a futile exercise, since as a creature under the Act, the Tribunal cannot find fault with the 2nd Respondent for not condoning the delay beyond 30 days.  17. The petitioner has lost the appellate remedy by efflux of time. It does not mean that the Petitioner should be left remediless. The petitioner submits that a full Bench of this Hon’ble Court in Electronics Corporation of India Limited (Writ Petition Nos. 9482 and 9485 of 2017,                                   18            dated 13.3.2018, dealing with similar situation, under          Central Excise Act, held that even if the appeal time          under the Act has expired, it does not prevent the          assessee from preferring a Writ Petition under Article          226 of the Constitution.”  10.   The High Court finally allowed the writ petition vide the  impugned judgment and order on the ground that the statutory  remedy had become ineffective for the"

A          The appeal   2          This appeal arises from a judgment of the High Court of Jharkhand. While  allowing a petition instituted by the respondents under Article 226 of the  Constitution, the Division Bench:   (i)        struck down the last paragraph of a notification dated 8 January 2015             issued by the State government in its Department of Commercial Taxes,             giving prospective effect to the rebate/deduction from electricity duty             offered under the Jharkhand Industrial Policy, 2012 1;   (ii)       directed that the notification shall be deemed to be in effect from 1 April             2011, when the Industrial Policy 2012 was enforced with retrospective             effect; and   (iii)      upheld the claim of the respondent that it was entitled to a             rebate/deduction from electricity duty in terms of the representation held             out in the Industrial Policy 2012, and that the denial of the exemption by             the State government for FYs 2011-12, 2012-13 and 2013-14 was contrary             to the doctrine of promissory estoppel.   The State is in appeal to challenge the judgment dated 11 December 2019.    1     “Industrial Policy 2012”                                               3                                                                               PART B  B          The issue   3          The issue for determination is whether the respondent is entitled to claim a  rebate or deduction of 50 per cent of the amount assessed towards electricity  duty for FYs 2011-12, 2012-13 and 2013-14. The respondent claims its  entitlement on the basis of the Industrial Policy 2012 (notified by the appellant on  16 June 2012) and a statutory notification dated 8 January 2015 issued under  Section 9 of the Bihar Electricity Duty Act 1948 2. The Bihar Act 1948 was  adopted with effect from 15 November 2000 for the State of Jharkhand under the  provisions of the Bihar Reorganization Act 2000.     2     “the Bihar Act 1948”                                               4                                                                          PART C  C          Captive power plant : assessment to electricity duty   4          The respondent was granted a certificate of commencement of commercial  production on 31 May 2013. The certificate records that the integrated  manufacturing unit of Sponge Iron and Mild Steel Billets, together with a captive  thermal plant of 20 MW capacity set up by the respondent commenced  commercial production on 17 August 2011. A certificate of registration was  granted to the respondent on 22 November 2011 under Rule 4 of the Bihar  (Jharkhand) Electricity Duty Rules 1949 3, according to which it was liable to pay  duty for distribution and/or consumption of the energy from 1 October 2011. On  the basis of the returns submitted by the respondent in Form-III, read with Rule 9  of the Bihar Rules 1949, assessment orders were passed by the assessing  officer for FY 2011-12 on 9 December 2014, for FY 2012-13 on 18 December  2015 and for FY 2013-14 on 16 December 2016.    3     “the Bihar Rules 1949”                                            5                                                                                            PART D  D          Industrial Policy 2012   5          The Industrial Policy 2012 was notified by the State government on 16  June 2012. Some of the salient features of the Industrial Policy 2012 need to be  visited:   (i)        Clause 32.10 provided an exemption from the payment of 50 per cent of             the electricity duty for a period of five years, for captive power plants             established for self-consumption or captive use:                          “32.10 Incentive for captive power plant                          New or existing industrial units setting up captive power plant                         shall be exempted from the payment of 50% of electricity duty                         for a period of five years for self - consumption or captive use                         (i.e. in respect of power being used by the plant) from the                         date of its commissioning”.      (ii)   Clause 35.7(b) envisaged that the entitlement would ensue from the             financial year following the Date of Production (DoP):                          “35.7(b) Industrial units will be entitled for reimbursement /                         payment of subsidy / incentives under different categories                         only from the next financial year of DoP.”     (iii)     Clause 38(b) stipulated that notifications enforcing the terms of the             industrial policy would be issued within a period of one month by the             Departments of the State government:                          “38. Monitoring and Review                          (b)      All concerned departments and organizations would                         issue necessary follow up notifications within a month to give                         effect to the provisions of this Policy. The implementation of                         this policy will be duly monitored by Government at the level                         of Chief Secretary at least once in a quarter, so that the State                         Government may carry out a mid - term review of this Policy.”                                                     6                                                                                                     PART E  E       Exemption from Electricity Duty    6       Though the Industrial Policy 2012 which was notified on 16 June 2012  envisaged that notifications by the Departments of the State government would  be issued within one month, there was a failure to comply with the time schedule.  In order to give effect to the exemption from electricity duty, a notification under  Section 9 of the Bihar Act 1948 was necessary. Section 9 recognizes the power  of the State government to grant exemptions 4.   7       Rule 6 of the Bihar Rules 1949 casts a duty on every assessee to pay the  duty which falls due within two calendar months of the month to which it relates.  Rule 9 requires the submission of a return in Form-III within a period of two  calendar months from the expiry of the month to which the return relates 5.   8       Since an exemption notification was not issued by the State of Jharkhand  under Section 9, a writ petition was filed under Article 226 of the Constitution  before the High Court of Jharkhand by a company by the name of Usha Martin  Limited 6. Eventually, the State government issued an exemption notification on 8  January 2015 but made it effective from the date on which it was issued. The  exemption notification is extracted below:    4  “Section 9. Power of State Government to grant exemptions- The State Government shall have power to exempt any person or class of persons notified in this behalf from the duty payable under this Act and such exemptions, may be subject to such conditions and exemptions if any, as may be mentioned in the said notification.” 5   Rule 6. Payment of duty. - Every assessee shall pay the full amount of the duty due from him under section 4           within two calendar months of the month to which the duty relates.   Rule 9. Submission of Returns. - Every assessee shall submit to the appropriate inspecting authority of the           Circle or sub-circle as the case may be, a return in Form III, within two calendar months from the           expiry of the month to which the return relates. The return shall be verified in the manner indicated           therein and shall be signed by the assessee or by his authorised agent. When an assessee holds           more than, one license, separate returns shall be submitted in respect of each license. 6   WP (T) No. 6008 of 2014, decided on 3/4 February 2015.                                                        7                                                                                 PART F               “S.O.67 dated 8th January, 2015 – In the light of Para 32.10 of              Jharkhand Industrial Policy, 2012 and in exercise of the              powers conferred by the Section 9 of the adopted Bihar              Electricity Duty Act, 1948, the Governor of Jharkhand is              pleased to exempt new or existing industrial units setting up              captive power plant for self-consumption or captive use (in              respect of power being used by the plant) from the payment              of 50% of Electricity Duty from the date of the commissioning              of the power plant.               This notification shall be effective from the date of issue and              shall remain effective till the period mentioned in the relevant              provisions of the Jharkhand Industrial Policy, 2012.”    9     The Industrial Policy 2012 announced an incentive in the form of a rebate  or deduction on electricity duty for a period of five years from the commencement  of production. If a notification under Section 9 had been issued by the State  government within a month, in terms of the representation held out by the  Industrial Policy 2012, the respondent would have had the benefit of almost the  entire period of exemption contemplated by the policy. But since the exemption  notification dated 8 January 2015 was made prospective, the respondent (and  other similar units) would receive the benefit of the exemption from electricity duty  for a much lesser period. Faced with this situation, the respondent instituted writ  proceedings before the High Court of Jharkhand in August 2019.   F     Before the High Court   10    Placing reliance on the doctrine of promissory estoppel, the respondent  sought, in its submissions before the High Court, one of two reliefs or directions.  First, the respondent claimed that the clause in the notification making it  prospective should be effaced since it was contrary to the representation that was  held out by the Industrial Policy 2012. Alternately, the respondent sought a                                                 8                                                                                PART F  direction that it would be entitled to an exemption from electricity duty for a period  of five years from the date of the issuance of the notification (the period of five  years being the envisaged period under the Industrial Policy 2012).   11      The High Court accepted the first of the two courses of action noted above,  placing reliance on the decisions of this Court in State of Bihar vs Kalyanpur  Cement Limited 7 (“Kalyanpur Cement Ltd.”) and Manuelsons Hotels Private  Limited vs State of Kerala 8 (“Manuelsons Hotels Pvt. Ltd.”). These decisions  are premised on the doctrine of promissory estoppel enunciated in Motilal  Padampat Sagar Mills Co. Ltd. vs State of UP 9 (“Motilal Padampat”). The High  Court held that a promise was made by the State government to give the benefit  of an exemption of 50 per cent in electricity duty for a period of five years, for self-  consumption or captive use, to all new and existing industrial units setting up  captive power plants in the State of Jharkhand. The High Court observed that it  was not the case of the State government that it did not intend to give the benefit  to these industrial units since, as a matter of fact, it had issued a notification,  though belatedly, on 8 January 2015.   12      Finding fault with the delay on the part of the government in issuing an  exemption notification, the High Court held that there was no specific reason for  the delay and that “but for the lethargic approach of the state authorities” the  exemption should have been issued within a month of the issuance of the  Industrial Policy 2012. The effect of the belated notification was to deny industrial  units of the benefit of the promise held out by the State government. The High  7   (2010) 3 SCC 274. 8   (2016) 6 SCC 766. 9   (1979) 2 SCC 409.                                             9                                                                             PART F  Court noted that the benefit was to be given with effect from FY 2011-12 for a  period of five years which ended in FY 2015-16. Since the exemption notification  was issued on 8 January 2015, the unit of the respondent and similarly placed  units would receive the benefit for only one or two years instead of promised five  years, as the Industrial Policy 2012 envisaged. In this backdrop, the conclusion of  the High Court was that the failure of the State to issue an exemption notification  within time should not stand in the way of the industrial units getting the benefit  which was promised and its denial of such benefit for FYs 2011-12, 2012-13 and  2013-14 was contrary to the doctrine of promissory estoppel. The issuance of an  exemption notification being a ministerial act, the High Court held that it should  not stand in the way of industrial units obtaining relief under the doctrine as a  result of the unconscionable delay caused by the State government. It was on  this rationale that the High Court concluded that the notification dated 8 January  2015 issued by the Commercial Tax Department of the State government ought  not to be construed with prospective effect and the clause making it prospective  would have to be struck down. The notification was deemed to be in effect from  the date of the Industrial Policy 2012 (1 April 2011). The electricity duty deposited  for FYs 2011-12, 2012-13 and 2013-14 was directed to be adjusted against the  future liability of the respondent towards electricity duty. Since the amount has  already been deposited no refund, but an adjustment of future payments was  directed.   13    The State is in appeal.                                             10                                                                          PART G  G       Submissions of Counsel   14      Mr Tapesh Kumar Singh, Additional Advocate General appearing for the  State of Jharkhand submits that:   (i)     In terms of the rebate/concession admissible under the Industrial Policy          2012, the respondent was required by Column 6(iv) of Form-III to raise a          claim for exemption from the payment of electricity duty;   (ii)    In all the three returns which were furnished by the respondent, a          rebate/deduction was sought only towards “auxiliary consumption”, which          was accepted and allowed by the assessing officer;   (iii)   In the absence of a claim for rebate/deduction sought before the assessing          officer, the assessing officer could not have granted a concession to the          respondent;   (iv)    The three assessment orders demonstrate that the respondent paid          electricity duty without protest or demur, and the computation made by the          assessing officer of the payable amount was accepted;   (v)     The three returns filed by the respondent for the corresponding          assessment years were belated and an amount of Rs 2000/- was levied as          penalty;   (vi)    The submission that the notification under Section 9 of the Bihar Act 1948          was belatedly issued on 8 January 2015 is not available to the respondent          since two of the three assessment orders were issued eleven months and          twenty-three months after the issuance of the notification. Hence, in the                                           11                                                                                 PART G            assessment orders of FYs 2012-13 and 2013-14, no prejudice has been            caused to the respondent by the belated issuance of the notification;   (vii)     For FY 2011-12, it has been conceded during the course of the hearing by            the respondent that upon a correct construction of the relevant terms of the            Industrial Policy 2012, it is not entitled in law to claim a rebate/deduction or            adjustment in view of Clause 35.7(b);   (viii)    The relief which has been granted by the High Court to another similarly            situated writ petitioner on 4 February 2015 shall operate erga omnes;   (ix)      In 2019, the respondent instituted three writ petitions for the corresponding            three assessment years – FYs 2011-12, 2012-13 and 2013-14 with a view            to overcome the period of limitation under the general law and these have            erroneously been allowed by the common judgment and order of the High            Court;   (x)       The law laid down in the judgments of the Constitution Bench in State of            Madhya Pradesh vs Bhailal Bhai 10 (“Bhailal Bhai”) and Suganmal vs            State of Madhya Pradesh 11 (“Suganmal”) continues to hold the field;   (xi)      The above judgments hold that any claim for refund could be made only            within the period of limitation prescribed under the general law for the filing            of suits for the recovery of amounts due and the High Court ought not to            entertain a petition under Article 226 in the exercise of its extra-ordinary            writ jurisdiction;   10      AIR 1964 SC 1006. 11      AIR 1965 SC 1740.                                               12                                                                                 PART G  (xii)      In the absence of any pleading before the High Court, there is a             presumption in law against the respondent that the amount claimed as             rebate/deduction from electricity duty has already been passed on to its             customers. Hence, the adjustment which has been granted by the High             Court would result in unjust enrichment to the respondent. Reliance was             placed on the decision of this Court in Mafatlal Industries Ltd. vs Union             of India 12 (“Mafatlal Industries”);   (xiii)     An alternative and efficacious statutory remedy of an appeal under Section             9A of the Bihar Act 1948 was available to the respondent against the             orders of assessment, and hence the High Court should have refused to             allow recourse to the extra-ordinary writ jurisdiction; and   (xiv)      Since the unit of the respondent commenced commercial production on 17             August 2011, whereas the Industrial Policy is of 2012, the doctrine of             promissory estoppel cannot be extended “backwards in favour of the             respondent”.   15         On the other hand, opposing these submissions on behalf of the  respondent and in support of the judgment of the High Court, Mr. Devashish  Bharuka, learned Counsel urged the following submissions:   (i)        The act of the State government in making the exemption notification             prospective in effect from 8 January 2015 is in derogation to the promise             held out by the State in its Industrial Policy 2012. The High Court in placing             reliance on the doctrine of promissory estoppel has correctly relied upon  12      (1997) 5 SCC 536.                                                13                                                                             PART G          the decisions of this Court in Motilal Padampat (supra), Kalyanpur          Cement Ltd (supra) and Manuelsons Hotels Pvt Ltd. (supra);   (ii)    As regards the claim of exemption by the first respondent:           (a)   The benefit of a rebate/deduction could not have been claimed in                the returns for FYs 2011-12, 2012-13 and 2013-14. The exemption                notification was issued only on 8 January 2015, and that too with                prospective effect;          (b)   The first respondent has, as a matter of fact, received a                rebate/deduction only for the period 8 January 2015 to 31 March                2015 and for FY 2015-16;   (iii)   As regards the submission that there has been a delay in instituting the          writ petitions before the High Court under Article 226:           (a)   The issue of delay has not been raised by the State government                either before the High Court or in the Special Leave Petition;          (b)   Once the High Court entertained the writ petition on merits, this                Court ought not to interfere on the ground of delay alone, particularly                when the judgment of the High Court is legally sustainable;          (c)   Delay by itself in filing a Writ Petition may not defeat the claim                unless the position of the opposite party has been so altered that it                cannot be retracted on account of a lapse of time or inaction of the                writ petitioner. The State has neither pleaded nor argued any                change in its position;                                              14                                                                            PART H         (d)    This is a case where the opposite party has not been put through                any hardship by reason of the delay in approaching the High Court;                and  (iv)   The decisions in Bhailal Bhai (supra) and Suganmal (supra) are         distinguishable as they relate to a writ petition seeking refund of illegally         collected tax.   16     On the above grounds, it has been submitted that the respondent is  entitled to the benefit of a rebate for a period of five years as held out in clause  32.10 of the Industrial Policy 2012.   17     The respondent has submitted that the period of five years may commence  from 17 August 2011 (the date of commercial production) or from FY 2012-13 (in  accord with clause 35.7(b) of Industrial Policy 2012) or from 8 January 2015 (the  date of the notification).   H      Analysis  18     The rival submissions will now be considered.   H.I    A State in breach of policy commitments  19     The Industrial Policy 2012 refers to the earlier Industrial Policy, which was  formulated in 2001 after the formation of the State of Jharkhand. The policy notes  that “considerable progress in industrialization has been achieved during the  policy period”. Yet, according to Clause 1.8, there is a need to “boost economic  activities to sustain the current level of growth and achieve even better pace of  development”. Clause 1.9 takes notice of the fact that “there has been large scale                                            15                                                                             PART H  change in (the) industrialization environment (sic) due to economic liberalization,  privatization and globalization”. The policy document states in Clause 1.12 that it  “aims at creating (an) industry-friendly environment for maximizing investment”:               “1.12. The present policy aims at creating industry-friendly              environment for maximizing investment especially in mineral              and natural resource based industries, MSMEs, infrastructure              development and rehabilitation of viable sick units. The              objective here is to maximize the value addition to state’s              natural resources by setting up industries across the state,              generating revenue and creating employment.”    Clause 1.13 stipulates that the policy was drafted after intensive interaction with  stakeholders and to accommodate their views. It was expected that the policy  would, upon implementation, facilitate industrialization of the State, generate  employment and add to its overall growth.   20    As an integral component of the policy, Clause 32.10 envisages the grant  of an exemption from the payment of 50 per cent of the electricity duty for a  period of five years both for new and existing industrial units setting up captive  power plants for self-consumption or captive use The period of five years was to  be reckoned from the date of the commissioning of the plant. Under Clause  35.7(b), the entitlement would ensue from the financial year following the date of  production. The State government was cognizant of the need to implement the  policy immediately to secure the benefit to eligible units over the entire term of  five years. Recognizing this need, Clause 38(b) envisaged that notifications by its  diverse departments to enforce the terms of the policy would be issued within a  period of one month.                                                16                                                                             PART H  21    The alacrity expected by the Industrial Policy 2012 of the State of  Jharkhand did not find a resonance in its administrative apparatus. The High  Court has justifiably referred to this as a case of bureaucratic lethargy. As a  matter of first principle, there can be no gainsaying the fact that when a statute,  such as the Bihar Act 1948, empowers the state to grant an exemption from its  provisions, the State has the discretion to determine the date from which and the  period over which the exemption will operate. An individual or entity cannot  compel the State to issue a notification providing for an exemption or to insist  upon the terms on which the government does so. Whether an exemption should  be issued and if so, the terms for the exemption, have to be determined by the  State. But this case does not rest on that principle nor did the claim of the  respondent require the High Court to make a departure from it. The Industrial  Policy 2012 contained a representation that a rebate/deduction would be granted.  It held out a representation that a notification would be issued in a month. These  were solemn commitments made by the State of Jharkhand. What remained was  their implementation by issuing a notification, which was to be done within one  month. The State government evidently intended to implement and act in  pursuance of its commitment. For, ultimately, it did issue a notification. But it did  so on 8 January 2015 – after a period of a month envisaged under the Industrial  Policy 2012 had dragged on for nearly three years.    22    It is time for the State government to take notice of the observations of the  High Court in regard to administrative lethargy. If the object of formulating the  industrial policy is to encourage investment, employment and growth, the                                            17                                                                              PART H  administrative lethargy of the State apparatus is clearly a factor which will  discourage entrepreneurship. The policy document held out a solemn  representation. It contemplated the grant of a rebate/deduction from the payment  of electricity duty not only to new units but to existing units as well who had or  would set up captive power plants. The State, in the present case, held out inter  alia a solemn representation in terms of Clauses 32.10 and 35.7(b) of the  entitlement of the exemption for a period of five years from the date of production.  Besides this, it also contemplated in Clause 38(b) that a follow-up exemption  notification would be issued within one month. That period of one month  stretched on interminably with the result that the purpose and object of granting  the exemption would virtually stand defeated. The net result was that when  belatedly, the State government issued a notification under Section 9 of Bihar Act  1948 on 8 January 2015, it was prospective. As a consequence, by the time that  the exemption notification was issued, a large part of the term for which the  exemption was to operate in terms of the Industrial Policy 2012 had come to an  end.   23     The State government was evidently inclined to grant the exemption. This  is not a case where due to an overarching requirement of public interest, the  State government decided to override the representation which was contained in  the Industrial Policy 2012. To the contrary, it sought to implement the  representation albeit in fits and starts. Firstly, there was a delay of three years in  the issuance of the notification. Secondly, by making the notification prospective,  it deprived units such as the respondent of the full benefit of the exemption which  was originally envisaged in terms of the Industrial Policy 2012.                                           18                                                                                  PART H  H.2   Building on Motilal Padampat   24    In this backdrop, the High Court has, with justification, adverted to two  decisions of this Court. In Kalyanpur Cement (supra), an industrial policy had  been notified in 1995 in the State of Bihar. The policy contained a provision for  monitoring and reviewing and envisaged that all departments and organizations  would issue a follow-up notification to give effect to the policy within one month.  This was similar to clause 38(b) of the policy in the present case. No notification  was issued by the State of Bihar to give effect to the industrial policy, which  lapsed on 31 August 2000. The claim to sales tax exemption by the unit was  rejected by the State government on the ground that it had decided not to grant  an incentive to a sick industrial unit. A follow-up notification was issued during the  pendency of the case before this Court. In the backdrop of these facts, this Court  speaking through Justice S S Nijjar, observed:               “85. Even if we are to accept the submissions…that the              provisions contained in Clause 24 were mandatory, the time              of one month for issuing the notification could only have been              extended for a reasonable period. It is inconceivable that it              could have taken the Government three years to issue the              follow-up notification. We are of the considered opinion that              failure of the appellants to issue the necessary notification              within a reasonable period of the enforcement of the Industrial              Policy, 1995 has rendered the decisions dated 6-1-2001 and              5-3-2001 wholly arbitrary. The appellant cannot be permitted              to rely on its own lapses in implementing its Policy to defeat              the just and valid claim of the Company. For the same reason              we are unable to accept the submissions of the learned              Senior Counsel for the appellant that no relief can be granted              to the Company as the Policy has lapsed on 31-8-2000.              Accepting such a submission wo"

INTRODUCTION WITH BRIEF OUTLINE                   1.        This appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment and                   order dated 27.06.2014 in FAO No. 36 of 2010, whereby the High Court of                   Delhi at New Delhi has dismissed the appeal preferred by the present                   appellant and has affirmed the judgment and order dated 23.11.2009 as                   passed by the Additional District Judge, West District, Tis Hazari Courts,                   Delhi in Probate Case No. 465 of 2006, resulting in rejection of the                   appellant’s prayer for grant of probate in relation to the Will dated                   20.05.2003, said to have been executed by the mother of the contesting Signature Not Verified  Digitally signed by DEEPAK SINGH Date: 2020.05.19 15:37:10 IST Reason:                  parties1.                   1 Hereinafter also referred to as ‘the contested Will’ or ‘the Will in question’ or the ‘document in                  question’.                                                                    1 2.     The prayer of the appellant for grant of probate in relation to the Will  in question has been declined concurrently by the Trial Court and by the  High Court essentially after finding several unexplained suspicious  circumstances surrounding the Will in question. Being aggrieved, the  petitioner-appellant, who was appointed as the executor of the Will in  question and who was, admittedly, the major beneficiary thereunder, has  preferred this appeal while maintaining that execution of Will by the testatrix  with due compliance of all the requirements of law has been clearly  established on record and there has not been any such suspicious  circumstance which might operate against the genuineness of the Will in  question.  3.     Therefore, essentially the point for determination in this appeal is as  to whether the Trial Court and the High Court were justified in declining to  grant probate in relation to the Will dated 20.05.2003 as prayed for.  THE PARTIES AND THE WITNESSES  4.     For comprehension of the subject-matter and for effective  determination of the questions raised in this appeal, we may take note of  the principal parties and the witnesses involved in the matter with their  respective roles as infra:  4.1.   The testatrix:         Smt. Amarjeet Mamik wife of Lt. Col. (Rtd.) D. S. Mamik.                                          2          Her husband Lt. Col. (Rtd.) D. S. Mamik had expired on 20.10.2002.           The testatrix herself expired on 21.05.2006, leaving behind two           daughters and one son, who are the contesting parties herein.  4.2.     The appellant: Smt. Kavita Kanwar           She is the younger daughter of the testatrix. She is shown as the           executor of the Will in question and she is the major beneficiary           thereunder, though with certain conditions. She had filed the petition           seeking probate that has been declined by the Trial Court and the           High Court.  4.3.     Respondent No. 1: Smt. Pamela Mehta2           She is the elder and widowed daughter of the testatrix. The           conditions stated in the contested Will are purportedly aimed at           making a provision for her residence. Initially, she did not file the           written statement of contest but at the later stage of proceedings           and during the evidence of the appellant, she attempted to file her           written statement. However, the prayer so made by her was           declined by the Trial Court. Nevertheless, she has continuously           contested the matter, as shall be noticed hereafter.     2 The respondent No. 1 of the present appeal was on record as respondent No. 2 in the Trial Court and High Court. Therefore, reference to her in the impugned judgments and other proceedings shall appear with description as ‘respondent No. 2’. However, for continuity of expressions in this judgment, she is referred to as ‘the respondent No. 1’ with contextual clarification wherever required.                                                  3 4.4.     Respondent No. 2: Col. (Rtd.) Prithiviraj Mamik3           He is the son of the testatrix. By way of bequeath in the Will in           question, he has been given ‘credit balance’ lying in the bank           accounts of the testatrix but with clarification that he shall not inherit           any portion of the immovable assets of testatrix. He had filed the           written statement and has consistently contested the claim for           probate of the Will in question.  4.5.     The attesting witnesses:           PW-2: Shri. Urvinder Singh Kohli, who is said to be a friend of the           appellant and his daughter got married to the son of a cousin of the           appellant; and PW-3: Major General Manjit Ahluwalia, who is son of           the sister of testatrix.  THE   IMMOVABLE                 PROPERTY             INVOLVED:            ANNALS          AND DESCRIPTION  5.       We may also notice at the outset that the immovable property, a part  whereof forms the subject of bequeath and which is the major bone of  contention in this case, has its own chronicle of different transfers as per the  desire of its original owner, father of the contesting parties. For  comprehension of the relevant factual aspects as also salient features of  this case, it is equally necessary to take note of the description of  immovable property in question as also the past dealings in relation thereto.    3 Similar to FN 2 ibid., the respondent No. 2 of the present appeal was on record as respondent No. 3 in the Trial Court and High Court. Therefore, in the impugned judgments and other proceedings he is described as ‘respondent No. 3’. However, for continuity of expressions in this judgment, he is referred to as ‘the respondent No. 2’ with contextual clarification wherever required.                                                4 5.1.   The property in question is identified as bearing number D-179,  Defence Colony, New Delhi admeasuring 325 square yards and comprising  of a building having ground floor, first floor, terrace and annexe block of  garage and servant quarter. The whole property originally belonged to Lt.  Col. (Rtd.) D. S. Mamik, father of the contesting parties who, in his lifetime,  gifted the ground floor of this property to the appellant by way of a  registered Gift Deed dated 25.01.2001; and thereafter, he bequeathed the  remaining portion/s, that is, the first floor, terrace and the annexe block of  garage and servant quarter in favour of his wife Smt. Amarjeet Mamik  through a registered Will dated 14.02.2001. Lt. Col. (Rtd.) D. S. Mamik  expired on 20.10.2002. Hence, after his demise, Smt. Amarjeet Mamik,  mother of the contesting parties, became owner of the first floor and other  portions of the said property except the ground floor.  5.2.   It is also noteworthy that at the time of execution of the contested  Will dated 20.05.2003, the testatrix Smt. Amarjeet Mamik was residing at  the ground floor of this property (which had otherwise been gifted to the  appellant by her father). The first floor of this property (which had otherwise  been bequeathed to the testatrix by her husband) has remained in  occupation of respondent No. 1, the widowed daughter of the testatrix.  THE WILL IN QUESTION  6.     The contested Will dated 20.05.2003 has been placed on record as  Ex. PW1/H. A vast variety of features related with this Will form the subject  of dispute in this case. The Trial Court and the High Court have also                                        5 analysed and taken into account several of the suspicious circumstances  surrounding this Will and the long length of arguments of the learned  counsel for the contesting parties in this appeal have also revolved around  this Will. Having regard to the questions involved, it would be apposite to  take note of the features and attributes of the contested Will to appreciate  the stand of the contesting parties as also the findings in the impugned  judgments.  6.1.    The contested Will is drawn up in two pages. It is a partly holograph  document in the manner that its opening and concluding passages/clauses  are handwritten whereas the other paragraphs/clauses are of electronic  print. This Will is said to have been executed on 20.05.2003 by Smt.  Amarjeet Mamik while residing on the ground floor of the property in  question at D-179, Defence Colony, New Delhi in the presence of the  attesting witnesses and the appellant.  7.      The Will in question reads as under: -                                      “WILL         I Amarjit Mamik aged 77 years w/o Lt. Col. (Retd) D.S.

Having taken note of the particulars of the parties and the property  involved as also the contents of the Will in question, we may now  summarise the pleadings of the parties, the issues framed by the Trial  Court, the material aspects of evidence led by the parties and the relevant  part of the proceedings in the Trial Court, which have bearing on the  questions involved herein.  8.1.     Briefly put, the petition leading to this appeal was filed by the  appellant on 06.11.2006 in the Court of District Judge at Delhi under  Section 276 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925 4 for grant of probate of the  Will in question, said to have been executed by her mother Smt. Amarjeet  Mamik while arraying the State (N.C.T., Delhi) as the party respondent.  Thereafter, by filing amended memo of parties, the present respondent Nos.  1 and 2 were arrayed as respondent Nos. 2 and 3 respectively. The  appellant stated the facts relating to the children of the testatrix as also the  said gift of the ground floor made by the father in her favour and then,  asserted in the petition that by the Will in question, the testatrix had  bequeathed the first floor and other portions except the ground floor of the   4 Hereinafter also referred to as ‘the Succession Act’.                                                  9 said property at No. D-179, Defence Colony, New Delhi in her favour with  directions to carry out one of the two options, i.e., either to construct on the  terrace of the first floor of the said property or to demolish the said building  and to re-construct and give the highest floor of the said building to Mrs.  Pamela Mehta (other daughter of testatrix) while retaining the terrace rights  thereon; and had bequeathed the balance in her savings bank account  maintained with Central Bank of India in favour of her son Col. (Rtd.)  Prithivijit Mamik. While stating that the Will in question was duly executed in  the presence of the aforesaid two witnesses and that the testatrix expired  on 21.05.2006, the appellant asserted that she was the executor and  beneficiary of the Will in question and was entitled to seek its probate.  8.2.

Rs. 577389.00”            ***                ***                 ***”  9.        The said petition seeking probate was eventually transferred to the  Court of Additional District Judge, Delhi for consideration. After requisite  publication and due notice, the respondents put in appearance but, on  18.04.2007, it was given out on behalf of the present respondent No. 1 that  she did not wish to file objections to the petition. However, the objections  with documents were indeed filed on behalf of the present respondent No.                                         12 2, who refuted the claim of the appellant and contended, inter alia, that the  Will in question was forged and fabricated, where the appellant was the  major beneficiary as also the executor; that there was no reason for  exclusion of the respondents and grandchildren from the legacy; and that  the property in question being an ancestral property, belongs to all the legal  heirs of late Shri D.S. Mamik. The replying respondent maintained that  there existed no dispute between testatrix and himself and there was no  reason for the mother to have excluded him from the Will. He also  contended that the property bequeathed in favour of the appellant was  worth crores of rupees and hence, it was impossible to comprehend that his  mother had left him merely a sum of Rs. 5,77,389/- when the relations  between him and his mother were cordial.  10.    The Trial Court framed the following issues for determination of the  questions involved in the matter: -         “1. Whether the Will dated 20-5-2003 of Smt. Amarjeet        Mamik is proper and valid? OPP        2. Whether the Will dated 20-5-2003 of Smt. Amarjeet Mamik        is forged and fabricated? OPR-3        3. Whether the petitioner is entitled to the grant of        Probate/Letter of Administration in respect of Will dated 20-5-        2003 of Smt. Amarjeet Mamik? OPP        4. Relief”  11.    In evidence, the appellant examined herself as PW-1; and the two  attesting witnesses of the contested Will, Shri Urvinder Singh Kohli and  Major General Manjit Ahluwalia as PW-2 and PW-3 respectively. Shri Nikhil  Kanwar, son of the appellant, was also examined as PW-4. In documentary  evidence, the Will in question was marked as Ex. PW1/H.                                        13 11.1.   It had been the consistent case of the appellant that she had no  prior knowledge that the Will was being executed on the given day and that  it was the testatrix who invited the appellant to her residence. The appellant  asserted in her evidence that only after reaching her mother’s house on the  given day, it came to her knowledge that her mother was executing a Will.  She further stated that she was not aware of the contents of the Will. It had  also been the assertion of the appellant that her parents had special love  and affection for her and that had been the reason for them having gifted  and bequeathed the said property to her only. The appellant also stated in  the cross-examination: (i) that she did not know the educational qualification  of the testatrix but she (testatrix) knew how to read and write in English; (ii)  that she and the testatrix were not residing together for the last 20-22 years;  (iii) that the testatrix neither discussed the contents of the Will with her nor  mentioned as to who had drawn and typed the Will in question; (iv) that she  came to know about the existence of the Will on 20-21 May, 2003; (v) that  her mother had not called respondent Nos. 1 and 2 on the day of execution  of the Will; (vi) that respondent No. 1 was living on the floor above the  testatrix and was looking after the testatrix, who was suffering from cancer;  (vii) that the testatrix had called the attesting witnesses; (viii) that she did  not know when the testatrix discussed the Will with the respondents; (ix)  that the testatrix had discussed the contents of the Will with the attesting  witnesses (x) that she remembered the testatrix writing something but was                                          14 not sure whether it was on the Will or something else 5; and (xi) that the  relations of the testatrix and the respondent No. 2 were strained.  11.2.    PW-2 and PW-3, the attesting witnesses, both specifically deposed  that on their arrival at the house of Smt. Amarjeet Mamik, they found that  the appellant was already present there; that the testatrix wrote something  on the Will in their presence before signing it; and that they were unaware  of the contents of the Will as the same was not discussed with them. PW-2  also maintained that on 18.05.2003, the appellant had called him to the  house of her mother on 20.05.2003. On the other hand, PW-3 deposed that  it was the testatrix who invited him to her house that day; that he was  having good relations with the appellant and the respondents; that the  testatrix was having good relations with respondent No. 2 and also that  when Smt. Amarjeet Mamik wrote something on the Will, she copied it from  a draft which she had with her.  12.      In opposition, the contesting respondents deposed as R2W-1 and  R3W-1 respectively. Shri Ram Gopal Meena from the Post Office, Defence  Colony was examined as R3W-2; Shri S.P. Sharma from State Bank of  India as R3W-3; Shri R.S. Negi from Defence Colony Association Club as  R3W-4; and Shri S.P. Khamra from Central Bank of India was examined as  R3W-5. Several documents produced by the respondents like family  photographs, birthday card sent by testatrix to respondent No. 2 etc. shall  also be referred to at the appropriate juncture, to the extent of relevancy.   5 Though in the affidavit-in-evidence, the appellant had mentioned that her mother had written the introduction portion as also the concluding portion on the Will.                                               15 12.1.   The respondent No. 1 in her evidence, inter alia, deposed that their  mother was not even 10th standard pass and that she was having cordial  relations with herself as also with the respondent No. 2.  12.2.   The respondent No. 2 in his evidence, inter alia, deposed that he  was having good relations with his mother; and, as he was serving in Indian  Army, the mother would talk to him over the phone and would even send  letters and birthday card wishing him all the happiness.  13.     Before proceeding further, one of the peculiar aspects of the matter,  which carry its own bearing on the relevant questions and emanates from  the record of proceedings of the Trial Court, may be noticed as infra.  13.1.   It appears that at the initial stage of proceedings in the Trial Court,  the relations of the appellant and the respondent No. 1 (who was  respondent No. 2 in the Trial Court) had not gone into any discord. As  noticed, the present respondent No. 1 stated before the Trial Court on  18.04.2007 that she did not wish to file any objections to the petition.  However, it appears that during the course of evidence of the appellant,  differences and disputes spurted between the appellant and the respondent  No. 1 and the appellant filed a separate civil suit for injunction against the  respondent No. 1. In sequel to this new position of conflict of interests, the  respondent No. 1 attempted to put forward direct contest of the petition  seeking probate and, on 24.03.2008, moved an application under Section  151 of the Code of Civil Procedure (‘CPC’) before the Trial Court, seeking  opportunity of further cross-examination of the appellant. In this application,                                        16 the respondent No. 1, inter alia, raised a plea about the alleged third page  of the Will in question. The application so moved was rejected by the Trial  Court on 25.03.2008 and, as regards the point concerning the alleged third  page of the Will, the Court observed as under:          “25.03.2008         ***              ***               ***         Point No. 2: From the point No. 2, it appears that         respondent No. 2 now is raising a totally different and new         stand regarding the 3rd page of the Will. She has not         produced the original or copy of the alleged 3 rd page along         with this application. The story of this 3rd page has come on         record first time through this application which cannot be         believed when nothing in this regard was asked in the cross         examination of PW-1. Non filing of any objections against         this Will despite taking opportunities prima facie leads to the         inference that respondent No. 2 accepted the Will as correct.         She was also given some portion in the property under the         Will and thus kept quite without disputing Will and now is         challenging the genuineness of the Will all of a sudden simply         on the ground that petitioner has filed a civil suit for injunction         claiming exclusive ownership of the property.             In the probate proceedings, the question of the ownership         or title is not decided and court is only concerned with the         fact whether the Will is genuine or not. Counsel for the         petitioner during arguments stated that the rights given to the         respondent No. 2 under the Will shall be protected. Keeping         in view these above circumstances, I am of the view that no         permission can be granted to the respondent No. 2 to cross         examine further at point No. 2 mentioned in para No. 4 of the         application.”   13.2.   On 24.03.2008, another part of the proceedings had been that the  Court closed the opportunity for cross-examination of some of the  witnesses of the appellant by the respondent No. 2. After the aforesaid  proceedings, an application under Order IX Rule 7 CPC was filed on behalf  of the respondent No. 2. On the other hand, an application seeking                 "

Except Special Leave Petition (Civil) D.No.13142 of 2020: (i)        permission to file Special Leave Petition is granted in all the concerned        matters; and (ii) Special Leave to Appeal is granted in all matters.         2.        These appeals arise out of the final judgment and order dated        06.05.2020 passed by the Division Bench of the High Court1 in Special        Appeal No.207 of 2019 and all connected matters whereby the Division        Bench of the High Court set aside the Order dated 29.03.2019 passed by the        Single Judge of the High Court in Writ Petition No.1188(SS) of 2019 and        other connected matters. These appeals, inter alia, deal with the extent of        rights of Shiksha Mitras and benefits conferred upon them by the decision        of this Court in State of U.P. and another vs. Anand Kumar Yadav and        others2.         3.        The facts leading to the decision of this Court in Anand Kumar        Yadav2 were set out in said decision as under:-                     “3. Brief factual matrix may be noted. The U.P. Basic                    Education Act, 1972 (the 1972 Act) was enacted to regulate        1           The High Court of Judicature at Allahabad, Lucknow Bench       2           (2018) 13 SCC 560                                                                                     7 Civil Appeal No. 3707 of 2020 (Arising out of SLP(C)No.6841 of 2020) Ram Sharan Maurya and Ors. Vs. State of U.P. and others                     and control basic education in the State of U.P. Section 19                   of the 1972 Act authorises the State Government to make                   rules to carry out the purpose of the Act. The U.P. Basic                   Education (Teachers) Service Rules, 1981 (the 1981 Rules)                   lay down sources of recruitment and qualification for                   appointment of teachers. The National Council for                   Teachers’ Education Act, 1993 (NCTE Act) was enacted by                   Parliament for planned and coordinated development for                   teacher education system. The Right of Children to Free and                   Compulsory Education Act, 2009 (the RTE Act, 2009) was                   enacted by Parliament for free and compulsory education to                   all children of the age of 6 to 14 years. Section 23 provides                   for qualification for appointment of teachers. NCTE was                   designated as authority under Section 23(1) to lay down the                   qualifications for appointment of teachers.                    4. NCTE issued Notification dated 23-8-2010 laying down                   such qualifications. With regard to teachers appointed prior                   to the said notification, it was stated that they were required                   to have qualifications in terms of the National Council for                   Teacher Education (Determination of Minimum                   Qualifications for Recruitment of Teachers in Schools)                   Regulations, 2001 (the 2001 Regulations), if the teachers                   were appointed on or after 3-9-2001 subject to their                   undergoing NCTE recognised six months’ special                   programme in certain situations. Teachers appointed before                   3-9-2001 were required to have qualifications as per the                   prevalent recruitment rules. One of the requirements under                   the said notification is the requirement of passing Teachers                   Eligibility Test (TET). However, by Letter dated 8-11-                   2010, the Central Government sought proposals for                   relaxation under Section 23(2) of the RTE Act which was                   followed by the relaxation Order dated 10-9-2012 for                   certain categories of persons which was to operate till 31-                   3-2014. Vide Letter of NCTE dated 14-1-2011, NCTE                   accepted the proposal of the State of Uttar Pradesh for                   training of untrained graduate Shiksha Mitras by open and                   distance learning but it was made clear that no appointment                   of untrained teachers was permitted.                    5. In exercise of powers under the RTE Act, 2009, the RTE                   Rules, 2010 were framed by the Central Government. At                   the same time, the State of U.P. also purported to frame                   rules called the U.P. RTE Rules, 2011.                                                                                     8 Civil Appeal No. 3707 of 2020 (Arising out of SLP(C)No.6841 of 2020) Ram Sharan Maurya and Ors. Vs. State of U.P. and others                     6. Reference may now be made to the scheme under which                   the Shiksha Mitras were recruited. On 26-5-1999, a                   Government Order was issued by the State of U.P. for                   engagement of Shiksha Mitras (Parateacher). The purported                   object of the Order was to provide universal primary                   education and for maintenance of teacher student ratio in                   primary schools by hiring persons who were not duly                   qualified at lesser cost as against the prescribed salary of a                   qualified teacher. The Government Order (G.O.) stated that                   up to the limit of 10,000, Shiksha Mitras could be                   contracted for academic session 1999-2000 at honorarium                   of Rs 1450 per month. The salient aspects of the scheme as                   summed up in the impugned judgment3 of the High Court                   from the said G.O. were: (Anand Kumar case3, SCC                   OnLine All para 17)                           “(i) The appointment of Shiksha Mitras was to be                          against the payment of an honorarium;                           (ii) The appointment was to be for a period of eleven                          months renewable for satisfactory performance;                           (iii) The educational qualifications would be of the                          intermediate level;                           (iv) The unit of selection would be the village where                          the school is situated and in the event that a qualified                          candidate was not available in the village, the unit                          could be extended to the jurisdiction of the Nyaya                          Panchayat;                           (v) The services of a Shiksha Mitra could be                          terminated for want of satisfactory performance;                           (vi) Selection was to be made at the village level by                          the Village Education Committee; and                           (vii) The scheme envisaged the constitution, at the                          district level, of a Committee presided over by the                          District Magistrate and consisting, inter alia, of the                          Panchayat Raj Officer and the District Basic       3         2015 SCC OnLine All 3997 : ILR 2015 All 1108 [Anand Kumar Yadav vs. Union of       India]                                                                                    9 Civil Appeal No. 3707 of 2020 (Arising out of SLP(C)No.6841 of 2020) Ram Sharan Maurya and Ors. Vs. State of U.P. and others                            Education Officer among other members to oversee                          implementation.”                    7. Further G.Os. were issued by the State of U.P. including                   G.O. dated 1-7-2001 expanding the scheme and clarifying                   that the scheme was not for employment in a regular service                   but to provide opportunity to the rural youth to render                   community service.                    8. Even though vide Notification dated 23-8-2010,                   minimum statutory qualification was laid down by NCTE,                   the issue for relaxation under Section 23(2) of the RTE Act                   was taken up by the Union Government for relaxation for                   the limited interim statutory period and if a particular State                   did not have adequate institutions for teachers training or                   did not have the adequate number of candidates during the                   period. The State Government, in response to the letter of                   the Central Government, responded by stating that it had                   appointed Shiksha Mitras on contractual basis who were                   required to be given teachers training. The Central                   Government issued an Order for relaxation under Section                   23(2) subject to certain conditions for the period up to 31-                   3-2014.                    9. The State Government submitted a revised proposal                   dated 3-1-2011 envisaging giving of training to the Shiksha                   Mitras which was accepted by the Central Government in                   terms of the Letter dated 14-1-2011 for two years’ diploma                   in elementary education through open and distance learning                   mode with a clear understanding that no untrained teachers                   will be appointed.                    10. Finally, the State of U.P. took the following steps which                   were subject-matter of challenge before the High Court:                    10.1. The Notification dated 30-5-2014 amending the U.P.                   RTE Rules introducing Rule 16-A authorising the State                   Government to relax minimum educational qualifications                   for appointment of Assistant Teachers in Junior Basic                   Schools.                    10.2. The Notification dated 30-5-2014, amending the 1981                   Rules: Rule 8 laid down revised qualifications for                   appointment of Assistant Master and Assistant Mistress of                                                                                    10 Civil Appeal No. 3707 of 2020 (Arising out of SLP(C)No.6841 of 2020) Ram Sharan Maurya and Ors. Vs. State of U.P. and others                     Junior Basic Schools which qualifications are different                   from the statutory qualifications under Section 23 of the                   RTE Act. Rule 5 was amended to add Shiksha Mitras as                   source for recruitment of teachers in addition to the existing                   source of direct recruitment in accordance with the existing                   rules. Rule 14 was also amended to enable Shiksha Mitras                   to be appointed as teachers against substantive posts                   without having the qualifications prescribed under Section                   23 of the RTE Act.                    10.3. G.O. dated 19-6-2013 was issued giving permission                   for appointment of Shiksha Mitras on the post of Assistant                   Teachers in primary schools without having the eligibility                   and qualifications in terms of the RTE Act, 2009. A time                   table was laid down for absorption of Shiksha Mitras as                   Assistant Teachers.                    10.4. The consequential executive orders were issued for                   absorption of 1,24,000 graduate Shiksha Mitras and 46,000                   intermediate Shiksha Mitras.”                                             …     …    …                    13. Batch of writ petitions was filed before the High Court                   by persons who claimed to be eligible for appointment and                   whose chances were affected by filling up of vacancies of                   teachers by regularising the Shiksha Mitras against the said                   vacancies……….                    14. Case set out in the petition was that in view of                   Notification issued by NCTE on 23-8-2010 laying down                   minimum qualification for appointment of Assistant                   Teacher for Classes I to VIII, the decision of the U.P.                   Government dated 19-6-2014 and amendments made by the                   U.P. Government on 30-5-2014 were in conflict with the                   Notification issued by NCTE on 23-8-2010 and could not,                   thus, be justified. TET being a mandatory qualification, the                   State Government could not make any appointment to the                   post of teacher without the said qualification. The                   appointments did not fall under the relaxation clause being                   post 23-8-2010 Notification and being not covered by the                   conditions for relaxation. The 1981 Rules of the State could                   not incorporate a provision for absorption of Shiksha Mitras                   in violation of law laid down by this Court in State of                                                                                     11 Civil Appeal No. 3707 of 2020 (Arising out of SLP(C)No.6841 of 2020) Ram Sharan Maurya and Ors. Vs. State of U.P. and others                     Karnataka v. Umadevi (3)4 as their appointment was dehors                   the 1981 Rules, having not been made after following the                   rules for appointment of teachers. It was also submitted that                   the nature of appointment of Shiksha Mitras was                   contractual to enable them to render community service and                   not in terms of prescribed qualifications for appointment of                   teachers. Training by open and distance learning mode was                   relevant only for teachers validly appointed and not for                   contractual employees appointed dehors the rules.                   Moreover, 46,000 Shiksha Mitras were not even graduates                   which was a condition for approval by NCTE in its letter                   dated 14-1-2011………”         3.1       The decision rendered by the Full Bench of the High Court of        Judicature at Allahabad was dealt with as under:-                    “17. The findings of the High Court in brief are that having                   regard to the nature of appointment of Shiksha Mitras, they                   could not be treated as teachers in terms of the 1981 Rules.                   They also did not have the qualifications prescribed under                   the said Rules inasmuch as on the date of appointment, they                   did not have graduate degree nor they had basic teachers’                   certificate as prescribed under the 1981 Rules. Reservation                   policy had also not been followed. No doubt they may have                   served the need of the hour, their regular appointment in                   violation of the requisite statutory qualification was illegal.                   Reference was made to earlier Full Bench judgment in                   Sandhya Singh v. State of U.P.5 with regard to the nature of                   such appointments.                    18. It was further held that Section 23(2) permitted                   relaxation of minimum qualification for appointment of                   teachers only for a limited period not exceeding five years                   and qualification for TET could not be relaxed as held by                   the Full Bench judgment of the High Court in Shiv Kumar                   Sharma v. State of U.P.6 for post-23-8-2010 appointments.                   Nor pre-23-8-2010 appointments could be saved unless                   initial appointments were to the post of teachers in terms of        4           (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753       5           (2013) 7 ADJ 1 (FB)       6           2013 SCC OnLine All 4097 : (2013) 6 ALJ 366 : 6 ADJ 310 (FB)                                                                                    12 Civil Appeal No. 3707 of 2020 (Arising out of SLP(C)No.6841 of 2020) Ram Sharan Maurya and Ors. Vs. State of U.P. and others                     applicable rules as stated in the Notification dated 23-8-                   2010. The amendments to the State RTE Rules, 2011 and                   the Service Rules of 1981 were in conflict with the mandate                   of Section 23(2) under which power to relax the minimum                   qualifications was vested only with the Central Government                   for a limited period. Moreover, the regularisation of                   Shiksha Mitras as teachers was not permissible in view of                   the law laid down in Umadevi (3)4. The appointment of                   Shiksha Mitras was not as teachers nor could it be held to                   be merely irregular in the absence of their minimum                   qualifications for the post of teachers which was a                   distinguishing feature rendering the judgments State of                   Karnataka v. M.L. Kesari7 and Amarendra Kumar                   Mohapatra v. State of Orissa8 inapplicable.         3.2.      Affirming the view taken by the Full Bench, this Court concluded:-                    “28. We are in agreement with the above findings. In view                   of clear mandate of law statutorily requiring minimum                   qualification for appointment of teachers to be appointed                   after the date of the Notification dated 23-8-2010, there is                   no doubt that no appointment was permissible without such                   qualifications. Appointments in the present case are clearly                   after the said date. Relaxation provision could be invoked                   for a limited period or in respect of persons already                   appointed in terms of applicable rules relating to                   qualifications. The Shiksha Mitras in the present case do not                   fall in the category of pre 23-8-2010 Notification whose                   appointment could be regularised.                    29. Further difficulty which stares one in the face is the law                   laid down by this Court on regularisation of contractually                   appointed persons in public employment. Appointment of                   Shiksha Mitras was not only contractual, it was not as per                   qualification prescribed for a teacher nor on designation of                   teacher nor in pay scale of teachers. Thus, they could not be                   regularised as teachers. Regularisation could only be of                   mere irregularity. The exceptions carved out by this Court                   do not apply to the case of the present nature.         7           (2010) 9 SCC 247 : (2010) 2 SCC (L&S) 826       8           (2014) 4 SCC 583 : (2014) 2 SCC (L&S) 54                                                                                      13 Civil Appeal No. 3707 of 2020 (Arising out of SLP(C)No.6841 of 2020) Ram Sharan Maurya and Ors. Vs. State of U.P. and others                     30. In view of our conclusion that the Shiksha Mitras were                   never appointed as teachers as per applicable qualifications                   and are not covered by relaxation order under Section 23(2)                   of the RTE Act, they could not be appointed as teachers in                   breach of Section 23(1) of the said Act. The State is not                   competent to relax the qualifications.                                         …      … …                    32. On the one hand, we have the claim of 1.78 lakh persons                   to be regularised in violation of law, on the other hand is the                   duty to uphold the rule of law and also to have regard to the                   right of children in the age of 6 to 14 years to receive quality                   education from duly qualified teachers. Thus, even if for a                   stop-gap arrangement teaching may be by unqualified                   teachers, qualified teachers have to be ultimately appointed.                   It may be permissible to give some weightage to the                   experience of Shiksha Mitras or some age relaxation may                   be possible, mandatory qualifications cannot be dispensed                   with. Regularisation of Shiksha Mitras as teachers was not                   permissible. In view of this legal position, our answers are                   obvious. We do not find any error in the view3 taken by the                   High Court.”          3.3       However, in the peculiar fact situation, following observations were        made by this Court:-                     “33. Question now is whether in the absence of any right in                   favour of Shiksha Mitras, they are entitled to any other                   relief or preference. In the peculiar fact situation, they ought                   to be given opportunity to be considered for recruitment if                   they have acquired or they now acquire the requisite                   qualification in terms of advertisements for recruitment for                   next two consecutive recruitments. They may also be given                   suitable age relaxation and some weightage for their                   experience as may be decided by the authority concerned.

In an F.I.R dated 18.11.2018, involving Sections 302, 307, 452, 427,                   341, 34 of the Indian Penal Code read with Section 25 of the Arms Act,                   1959, Sections 3, 4, 5, 6 of the Explosive Substances Act, 1908 and                   Section 13 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, it was                   stated as follows:                            “I am a resident of above address and doing the business                          of furniture at Nehru Complex, Amritsar. I do my religious                          services in the Nirankari Bhawan at Rajasansi every Signature Not Verified  Digitally signed by                          Sunday. Today, i.e, on 18.11.2018, Satsang was going on Charanjeet kaur Date: 2020.10.12 17:45:12 IST                          at Satsang Bhawan, where about 200 Satsangis were                          present. At about 11.30 a.m., I along with my companion Reason:                              Gagandeep Singh son of Balwinder Singh, resident of                                                                                        1         Gumtala, was doing the duty of a Security Guard on the         main gate, when two young boys came there on a Pulsar         Motor Cycle without number of Black shade. Out of them,         one had worn Jean and Jacket and was having turban on         his head and he has muffled his face with a cloth of check.         He went inside and the other young boy, who was wearing         Kurta, Pyjama and Jacket and had muffled his face with a         handkerchief, took out a Pistol from the fold of his Pyjama         and made us to stand together near the Bathroom. The         young boy who had gone inside the Satsang Hall threw a         Hand Grenade on the stage with his right hand. An         explosion took place and the above-said young boy took         out a Pistol and ran towards the gate. Both the young men         ran towards Village Adliwal on their Pulsar Motor Cycle.         Due to Grenade explosion, about 22 persons from the         Sangat sustained serious injuries. The other persons         arranged conveyance and carried the injured to IVY         Hospital, Amritsar and Guru Nanak Dev Hospital, Amritsar,         where Sukhdev Kumar son of Kans Raj, resident of Kohali,         now resident of Mirankot, aged about 45 years, Kuldeep         Singh son of Joginder Singh, resident of Bagga and         Sandeep Singh son of Amarjit Singh, resident of Ward No.         7, Rajasansi died in IVY Hospital, Amritsar. The above         young men by throwing a Hand Grenade on the Sangat,         have injured 22 persons seriously, out of which three         persons have died. Deterrent action be taken against the         above-mentioned accused. I have heard my statement. It is         correct.”   3. Pursuant to this F.I.R, the Punjab State Police apprehended the    Appellant, one Bikramjit Singh, aged 26 years, on 22.11.2018, on    which date he was remanded to custody by the learned Sub-Divisional    Magistrate. After 90 days in custody, which expired on 21.02.2019, an    application for default bail was made to the Sub-Divisional Judicial    Magistrate, Ajnala. This application was dismissed on 25.02.2019 on                                                                          2 the ground that the learned Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate had, by  an order dated 13.02.2019, already extended time from 90 days to  180 days under Section 167 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973  (hereinafter referred to as “the Code”) as amended by the Unlawful  Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 (hereinafter referred to as “UAPA”) –  See Section 43-D(2). However, this Order was challenged by way of a  revision petition by the Appellant and his co-accused, which revision  succeeded by an order dated 25.03.2019, by which the learned  Additional Sessions Judge being the Special Court set up under the  National Investigation Agency Act, 2008 (hereinafter referred to as the  “NIA Act”) held as follows:         “6. After hearing the Ld Counsel for revision petitioner and        Ld PP for State, I am of the view that since Ld PP has not        controverted the proposition of law, wherein it is provided        that Ilaqa Magistrate has no jurisdiction to entertain any        application for extension the period of investigation or        granting bail u/s 167 (2) Cr.P.C in default of presentation of        Challan u/s 45 D (2) Unlawful Activities (Prevention Act        1967) and in view of the Notification supra passed by        Government of Punjab, to deal with the cases of unlawful        activities act, court of session or court of Additional Session        Judge, in every district has been designated to try the said        cases, so the application for seeking extension of time for        filing challan was not maintainable before Ilaqa magistrate.        7. Therefore, in view of the said notification as well as the        case laws referred by the Ld Counsel for revision petitioner,        only this court being special designated court was        competent to pass an order on any application moved u/s        45(D) (2) Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act 1967. It        means, Ilaqa Magistrate was not competent to pass any        order on any such application. In case the same has been                                                                           3          filed and passed i.e. without its jurisdiction. So because of          the said reason order passed by Ilaqa magistrate is not          sustainable in the eyes of law and the same is liable to be          set aside by way of acceptance of this revision petition.          Accordingly this revision is allowed and order of Ilaqa          magistrate dated 13.02.2019 is set aside. Trial court record          along with copy of this order be sent back to the Trial Court          and file of this court be consigned to record room.”  4. One day later, on 26.03.2019, a charge sheet was filed before the    learned Special Judge after police investigation, in which Sections    302, 307, 452, 427, 341, 34 of the Indian Penal Code read with    Section 25 of the Arms Act, 1959, Sections 3, 4, 5, 6 of the Explosive    Substances Act, 1908 and Sections 13, 16, 18, 18-B and 20 of the    Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 were invoked for offences    that were committed pursuant to investigation of the FIR lodged on    18.11.2018. Meanwhile, a revision petition that was filed against the    order dated 25.02.2019, was dismissed by the Special Judge on    11.04.2019 who, after noticing the order dated 25.03.2019 allowing    the revision petition against the order dated 13.02.2019 of the Judicial    Magistrate, yet refused to grant default bail as follows:           “10. No doubt, vide gazette notification issued by          Government of Punjab on 10.06.2014, the Session Judge          and first Additional Session Judge at each District Head          Quarters in the State are designated as special court for          the trial of offences of unlawful activities act. However, as          per the local arrangement, all the cases pertaining to          unlawful activities act are dealt in this court. So, being a          special court, this court is competent to directly receive the          challan or police report under section 173 Cr PC. Since the          challan has already been presented and in the judgement                                                                            4          titled as Abdul Aziz PV and Other vs National Investigation          Agency                                                   2015          (1) RCR (Criminal) 239, it has been held that merely          because certain facets of the matter called for further          investigation, it does not deem such report anything other          than a final report, revisionist are not entitled to statutory          bail under section 167 (2) Cr PC.          xxx xxx xxx          12. Since Challan has already been presented, so revision          petitioner have lost their right for bail by way of default          under section 167 (2) Cr PC. Therefore there is no reason          to interfere in the order of Ilaqa Magistrate passed under          section 167 (2) Cr PC so this revision petition fails and is          dismissed. Consign file to the record room.” 5. On the same day i.e. 11.04.2019, an application for default bail dated    08.04.2019 was also dismissed. By the impugned judgment dated    30.10.2019, the High Court, after setting out Section 167 of the Code    of Criminal Procedure, 1973 and some of the provisions of the UAPA    and NIA Act, then arrived at the following conclusion:           “A joint interpretation of Section 167 (2) Cr.P.C. read with          Section 43 (d) UAP Act, Section 6, 13 & 22 of NIA Act          would show that in case the investigation is being carried          out by the State police, the Magistrate will have power          under Section 167 (2) Cr.P.C. read with Section 43 (a) of          UAP Act to extend the period of investigation upto 180          days and then, commit the case to the Court of Sessions          as per provisions of Section 209 Cr.P.C., whereas in case          the investigation is conducted by the agency under the NIA          Act, the power shall be exercised by the Special Court and          challan will be presented by the agency before the Special          Court.          xxx xxx xxx          It is not case of the petitioner that the investigation was          conducted by the agency under Section 6 of the NIA Act          and till committal of the case to the Court of Sessions, as                                                                            5          per Section 22 (3) of NIA Act, it cannot be said that the          Magistrate has no power and therefore, the order dated          25.03.2019 suffers from illegal infirmity.          The arguments raised by learned senior counsel for the          petitioner that the petitioner is entitled to default bail under          Section 167 (2) Cr.P.C., in view of judgment of the Hon'ble          Supreme Court in Sanjay Dutt's case (supra), is not          available, once the challan was presented by the          prosecution on 25.03.2019, as the application was filed by          the petitioner on the next day i.e. 26.03.2019          The Judge, Exclusive Court has recorded a well reasoned          finding that mere fact that sanction has not been granted          so far, is no ground to grant concession of bail, as it is          rightly held that besides the offence committed under the          UAP Act, the accused is also facing the trial for committing          the offence under Sections 302, 307, 452, 341, 427, 34          IPC read with Section 25/54/59 of Arms Act and Sections 3,          4, 5, & 6 of Explosive Act, for which no sanction is required          to prosecute the petitioner.          For the reasons recorded above and in view of judgment of          the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Hitendra Vishnu Thakur vs.          State of Maharashtra, 1994 (3) RCR (Crl.) 156, finding no          merit in the present petition, the same is dismissed.”  6. Shri Colin Gonsalves, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of    the Appellant, referred to both the enactments as aforesaid in copious    detail and stressed the fact that once the Special Court had been set    up as an exclusive Court to try all offences under the UAPA, such    offences being scheduled offences relatable to the NIA Act, it was the    Special Court alone which had exclusive jurisdiction to extend the    period of 90 days to 180 days under Section 43-D (2)(b) of the UAPA.    This being the case, on an application having been made prior to the    filing of the charge sheet for default bail, his contention was that the                                                                              6   indefeasible right to default bail arose immediately after 21.02.2019,    when the 90 day period was over. An order that is passed without    jurisdiction by the learned Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate dated    13.02.2019, had been corrected by the learned Additional Sessions    Judge/Special Court vide the order dated 25.03.2019, as a result of    which his right to default bail sprung into action before filing of the    charge sheet dated 26.03.2019.       He, therefore, assailed the High    Court judgment on both counts – Firstly, that the exclusive jurisdiction    to extend time vested only in the Special Court and not in the Ilaqa    Magistrate, despite the fact that it was the State Police Agency that    investigated these offences. Secondly, he also argued, relying upon a    number of judgments, that the Appellant’s right to default bail was not    extinguished by the filing of the charge sheet dated 26.03.2019, as    was incorrectly held by the High Court.  7. Smt. Jaspreet Gogia, learned Advocate who appeared on behalf of the    State of Punjab, also took us through the provisions of both the    aforesaid enactments. She stressed in particular Section 10 of the NIA    Act, stating that nothing in the said Act would affect the powers of the    State Government to investigate and prosecute any scheduled    offence. She also stressed the fact that the entire investigation was    done only by the State Police and not by the National Investigation    Agency. This being the case, she argued that the Ilaqa Magistrate had                                                                           7   jurisdiction to extend time, and having so extended time on    13.02.2019, any application for default bail after the 90 day period was    over i.e. after 21.02.2019 had necessarily to be dismissed. She also    argued that the first application for default bail which was filed on or    before 25.03.2019, had spent its force, having been dismissed, and    that the application dated 08.04.2019 filed for default bail was clearly    after 26.03.2019, when the charge sheet was filed and, therefore, was    correctly dismissed by the order of the learned Special Judge dated    11.04.2019.  8. Having heard learned counsel for the parties, it is important at this    stage to set out all the relevant provisions of the three enactments that    we are directly concerned with – the Code, UAPA and NIA Act.  9. It is important to note that the expression “Court” is not defined by the    Code. On the other hand, Section 6 of the Code refers to classes of    Criminal Courts as follows:           “6. Classes of Criminal Courts.          Besides the High Courts and the Courts constituted under          any law, other than this Code, there shall be, in every          State, the following classes of Criminal Courts, namely:            (i) Courts of Session;            (ii) Judicial Magistrates of the first class and, in any            metropolitan area, Metropolitan Magistrates;            (iii) Judicial Magistrates of the second class; and            (iv) Executive Magistrates.”                                                                            8    The Court of Sessions is then referred to as a Court that is established     by the State Government under Section 9(1) of the Code for every     Sessions Division.  10. Section 26 of the Code refers to Courts by which offences are triable.     We are concerned directly with Section 26(b) which states as follows:            “26. Courts by which offences are triable.           Subject to the other provisions of this Code,           xxx xxx xxx           (b) any offence under any other law shall, when any Court           is mentioned in this behalf in such law, be tried by such           Court and when no Court is so mentioned, may be tried by           —             (i) the High Court, or             (ii) any other Court by which such offence is shown in the             First Schedule to be triable.” 11. Section 167 of the Code makes it clear that whenever a person is     arrested and detained in custody, the time for investigation relating to     an   offence   punishable    with   death,   imprisonment   for   life   or     imprisonment for a term of not less than 10 years, cannot ordinarily be     beyond the period of 15 days, but is extendable, on the Magistrate     being satisfied that adequate grounds exist for so doing, to a     maximum period of 90 days – See first proviso (a)(i) to Section 167(2)     of the Code. The said proviso goes on to state that the accused     person shall be released on bail if he is prepared to and does furnish     bail on expiry of the maximum period of 90 days, and every person so                                                                             9    released on bail be deemed to be so released under the provisions of      Chapter XXXIII for the purposes of that Chapter. 12. The First Schedule to the Code then sets out at the fag end, in Part II     thereof, classification of offences against other laws as follows:                           THE FIRST SCHEDULE                   CLASSIFICATION OF OFFENCES       II.—CLASSIFICATION OF OFFENCES AGAINST OTHER                            LAWS           Offence        Cognizable Bailable or         By what                             or non-      non-             court                           cognizable   bailable          triable     If punishable with Cognizable Non-                 Court     of     death,                           bailable          Session     imprisonment     for     life,             or     imprisonment     for     more than 7 years     If punishable with Ditto         Ditto             Magistrate     imprisonment for 3                                 of     first     years and upwards                                  class     and not more than     7 years     If punishable with Non-          Bailable          Any     imprisonment     for cognizable                    Magistrate     less than 3 years or     with fine only  13. The UAPA deals with “unlawful activity” and “unlawful association”, and     interdicts both unlawful activity and unlawful association as defined     under Sections 2(o) and 2(p). It further defines what are terrorist acts,     terrorist gangs and terrorists organisations under Section 2(k), 2(l) and     2(m) and proscribes each of these in offences which are than fleshed                                                                          10 out under its provisions. What is important from our point of view in this  case is the definition of “Court” in Section 2(1)(d) of UAPA which is as  follows:         “2. Definitions.-(1) In this Act, unless the context otherwise        requires,-        xxx xxx xxx        (d) “court” means a criminal court having jurisdiction, under        the Code, to try offences under this Act and includes a        Special Court constituted under section 11 or under section        21 of the National Investigation Agency Act, 2008” Equally important is the provision contained in Section 43-D(2) of  UAPA, which is set out as follows:      “43-D. Modified application of certain provisions of the      Code.         xxx xxx xxx         (2) Section 167 of the Code shall apply in relation to a case        involving an offence punishable under this Act subject to        the modification that in sub-section (2),-             (a) the references to “fifteen days”, “ninety days” and            “sixty days”, wherever they occur, shall be construed as            references to “thirty days”, “ninety days” and “ninety            days” respectively; and             (b) after the proviso, the following provisos shall be            inserted, namely:—                “Provided further that if it is not possible to complete               the investigation within the said period of ninety days,               the Court may if it is satisfied with the report of the               Public Prosecutor indicating the progress of the               investigation and the specific reasons for the               detention of the accused beyond the said period of                                                                             11                 ninety days, extend the said period up to one                 hundred and eighty days:                 Provided also that if the police officer making the                 investigation under this Act, requests, for the                 purposes of investigation, for police custody from                 judicial custody of any person in judicial custody, he                 shall file an affidavit stating the reasons for doing so                 and shall also explain the delay, if any, for requesting                 such police custody.””  14. A cursory reading of these provisions would show that the offences     under the UAPA under Sections 16, 17, 18, 18-A, 18-B, 19, 20, 22-B,     22-C and 23, being offences which contain maximum sentences of     over 7 years, would be exclusively triable by a Court of Sessions when     read with Part II of the First Schedule to the Code. It is only after the     NIA Act was enacted that the definition of “Court” was extended to     include Special Courts that were set up under Section 11 or Section      22 of the NIA Act. 15. When we come to the NIA Act, the Preamble of the said Act indicates     the thrust of the provisions of that Act as follows:           “An Act to constitute an investigation agency at the national           level to investigate and prosecute offences affecting the           sovereignty, security and integrity of India, security of State,           friendly relations with foreign States and offences under           Acts enacted to implement international treaties,           agreements, conventions and resolutions of the United           Nations, its agencies and other international organisations           and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.”    Under Section 2(g) “Scheduled Offence” is defined as follows:           “2. Definitions.- (1) In this Act, unless the context           otherwise requires,-           xxx xxx xxx                                                                                12           (g) “Scheduled Offence” means an offence specified in the           Schedule””    Section 2(h) defines “Special Court” as follows:           “2. Definitions.- (1) In this Act, unless the context           otherwise requires,-           xxx xxx xxx           (h) “Special Court” means a Special Court constituted           under section 11 or, as the case may be, under section 22” 16. Section 3 constitutes a National Investigation Agency which is a     special agency set up for prosecution of offences under the Acts     specified in the Schedule by the Central Government. It may be noted     that the UAPA is Item 2 of the said Schedule. Section 10, upon which     strong reliance is placed by the State, is as follows:            “10. Power of State Government to investigate           Scheduled Offences.—Save as otherwise provided in this           Act, nothing contained in this Act shall affect the powers of           the State Government to investigate and prosecute any           Scheduled Offence or other offences under any law for the           time being in force”    Sections 11 and 22 which speak of the power of the Central     Government and the State Government respectively, to designate     Courts of Sessions as Special Courts, are as follows:             “11. Power of Central Government to constitute Special           Courts.—           (1) The Central Government shall, by notification in the           Official Gazette, for the trial of Scheduled Offences,           constitute one or more Special Courts for such area or           areas, or for such case or class or group of cases, as may           be specified in the notification.                                                                            13 (2) Where any question arises as to the jurisdiction of any Special Court, it shall be referred to the Central Government whose decision in the matter shall be final. (3) A Special Court shall be presided over by a judge to be appointed by the Central Government on the recommendation of the Chief Justice of the High Court. (4) The Agency may make an application to the Chief Justice of the High Court for appointment of a Judge to preside over the Special Court. (5) On receipt of an application under sub-section (4), the Chief Justice shall, as soon as possible and not later than seven days, recommend the name of a judge for being appointed to preside over the Special Court. (6) The Central Government may, if required, appoint an additional judge or additional judges to the Special Court, on the recommendation of the Chief Justice of the High Court. (7) A person shall not be qualified for appointment as a judge or an additional judge of a Special Court unless he is, immediately before such appointment, a Sessions Judge or an Additional Sessions Judge in any State. (8) For the removal of doubts, it is hereby provided that the attainment, by a person appointed as a judge or an additional judge of a Special Court, of the age of superannuation under the rules applicable to him in the service to which he belongs shall not affect his continuance as such judge or additional judge and the Central Government may by order direct that he shall continue as judge until a specified date or until completion of the trial of the case or cases before him as may be specified in that order. (9) Where any additional judge or additional judges is or are appointed in a Special Court, the judge of the Special Court may, from time to time, by general or special order, in writing, provide for the distribution of business of the Special Court among all judges including himself and the additional judge or additional judges and also for the disposal of urgent business in the event of his absence or the absence of any additional judge.                                                                    14        22. Power of State Government to constitute Special        Courts.—        (1) The State Government may constitute one or more        Special Courts for the trial of offences under any or all the        enactments specified in the Schedule.        (2) The provisions of this Chapter shall apply to the Special        Courts constituted by the State Government under sub-        section (1) and shall have effect subject to the following        modifications, namely—        (i) references to “Central Government” in sections 11 and        15 shall be construed as references to State Government;        (ii) reference to “Agency” in sub-section (1) of section 13        shall be construed as a reference to the “investigation        agency of the State Government”;        (iii) reference to “Attorney-General for India” in sub-section        (3) of section 13 shall be construed as reference to        “Advocate-General of the State”.        (3) The jurisdiction conferred by this Act on a Special Court        shall, until a Special Court is constituted by the State        Government under sub-section (1) in the case of any        offence punishable under this Act, notwithstanding anything        contained in the Code, be exercised by the Court of        Session of the division in which such offence has been        committed and it shall have all the powers and follow the        procedure provided under this Chapter.        (4) On and from the date when the Special Court is        constituted by the State Government the trial of any        offence investigated by the State Government under the        provisions of this Act, which would have been required to        be held before the Special Court, shall stand transferred to        that Court on the date on which it is constituted.” Section 13 speaks of the jurisdiction of the Special Courts as follows:        “13. Jurisdiction of Special Courts.—        (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code, every        Scheduled Offence investigated by the Agency shall be        tried only by the Special Court within whose local        jurisdiction it was committed.                                                                         15       (2) If, having regard to the exigencies of the situation       prevailing in a State if,—       (a) it is not possible to have a fair, impartial or speedy trial;       or       (b) it is not feasible to have the trial without occasioning the       breach of peace or grave risk to the safety of the accused,       the witnesses, the Public Prosecutor or a judge of the       Special Court or any of them; or       (c) it is not otherwise in the interests of justice, the       Supreme Court may transfer any case pending before a       Special Court to any other Special Court within that State       or in any other State and the High Court may transfer any       case pending before a Special Court situated in that State       to any other Special Court within the State.       (3) The Supreme Court or the High Court, as the case may       be, may act under this section either on the application of       the Central Government or a party interested and any such       application shall be made by motion, which shall, except       when the applicant is the Attorney-General for India, be       supported by an affidavit or affirmation.” Section 14 clarifies that Special Courts may also try offences other  than the scheduled offences as follows:         “14. Powers of Special Courts with respect to other       offences.—       (1) When trying any offence, a Special Court may also try       any other offence with which the accused may, under the       Code be charged, at the same trial if the offence is       connected with such other offence.       (2) If, in the course of any trial under this Act of any       offence, it is found that the accused person has committed       any other offence under this Act or under any other law, the       Special Court may convict such person of such other       offence and pass any sentence or award punishment       authorised by this Act or, as the case may be, under such       other law.”                                                                             16 Section 16 is important and sets out the procedure and powers of  Special Courts as follows:         “16. Procedure and powers of Special Courts.—       (1) A Special Court may take cognizance of any offence,       without the accused being committed to it for trial, upon       receiving a complaint of facts that constitute such offence       or upon a police report of such facts.       (2) Where an offence triable by a Special Court is       punishable with imprisonment for a term not exceeding       three years or with fine or with both, the Special Court may,       notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1) of       section 260 or section 262 of the Code, try the offence in a       summary way in accordance with the procedure prescribed       in the Code and the provisions of sections 263 to 265 of       the Code shall, so far as may be, apply to such trial:       Provided that when, in the course of a summary trial under       this sub-section, it appears to the Special Court that the       nature of the case is such that it is not desirable to try it in a       summary way, the Specia"

Writ Petition (Criminal) No. 160 of 2020                    Page 2 of 128            7.     337/2020 295A IPC                    Naya Nagar, Thane                                                        (Maharashtra)                  The gist of the FIRs is almost identical. The petitioner, while         hosting the debate, had described Pir Hazrat Moinuddin Chishti,         also known as Pir Hazrat Khwaja Gareeb Nawaz, as “aakrantak         Chishti aya... aakrantak Chishti aya... lootera Chishti aya... uske         baad dharam badle”. Translated in English the words spoken         would read – “Terrorist Chishti came. Terrorist Chishti came.         Robber Chishti came - thereafter the religion changed,” imputing         that ‘the Pir Hazrat Moinuddin Chishti, a terrorist and robber, had         by fear and intimidation coerced Hindus to embrace Islam.’ It is         alleged that the petitioner had deliberately and intentionally         insulted a Pir or a pious saint belonging to the Muslim community,         revered even by Hindus, and thereby hurt and incited religious         hatred towards Muslims.   5.     The petitioner, as per the writ petition, claims that post the telecast         he was abused and given death threats on his phone, Twitter,         Facebook and other social media platforms. Fearing for his life and         limb, the petitioner had filed FIR No. 539 of 2020 dated 20 th June,         2020 at P.S. Sector-20, Noida, Uttar Pradesh, and submitted the         links to the threats received through social media platforms.    Writ Petition (Criminal) No. 160 of 2020     Page 3 of 128 6.     On or about 22nd June, 2020, the present writ petition was filed         under Article 32 of the Constitution of India with an application for         interim relief. This writ petition came up for hearing on 26 th June,         2020 whereby notice was issued with a direction to the petitioner         to implead the informants in the respective FIRs/complaints. An         interim order was passed directing that till the next date of hearing         there would be a stay on further steps/action on the FIRs         mentioned in the writ petition, relating to the telecast dated 15 th         June, 2020, and the petitioner was protected against any coercive         process arising out of or relating to the said FIRs.   7.     Pursuant to the aforesaid liberty, the writ petition was amended to         implead the complainants. Thereafter, the writ petition was         amended on a second occasion. The prayers made in the last         amended writ petition to this Court are:                    (a) for issue of writ of certiorari, quashing the                   complaints/FIRs referred to above or any other FIR or                   criminal complaint which may be filed thereafter                   relating to the telecast in question dated 15 th June,                   2020;                    (b) strictly in the alternative, transfer and club the                   FIRs mentioned above or elsewhere in the country                   with the first FIR, i.e. FIR No. 78, P.S. Dargah, Ajmer,                   Rajasthan;                    (c) issue a writ of mandamus to the effect that no                   coercive process shall be taken against the petitioner    Writ Petition (Criminal) No. 160 of 2020        Page 4 of 128                   in the FIRs so lodged or subsequent complaint or                   FIRs on the subject broadcast; and                    (d) direct the Union of India to provide adequate                   safety and security to the petitioner, his family                   members and his colleagues at various places in the                   country.”  8.     The petitioner, in his submissions, claims that he has faith in         Banda Nawaz Hazrat Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti and has also         gone on Ziyarat pilgrimage to Ajmer Sharif to offer respects and to         worship. Expressing regret, the petitioner claims that the attributed         words were uttered inadvertently and by mistake; in fact, the         petitioner wanted to refer to Alauddin Khilji and not Gareeb Nawaz         Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti. Realising his mistake and to amend the         inadvertent error, and to dispel doubts and vindicate himself, the         petitioner had promptly issued a clarification and an apology vide a         tweet dated 17th June 2020. A video with similar clarification and         apology was also telecast by the news channel on the very same         day. Contention of the petitioner is that in a whirl, he had taken the         name of Chishti though he had no such intention, and he laments         his lapse as he did not wish to hurt anybody. Accordingly, he had         apologised to anyone who had been hurt. In addition, a number of         submissions have been made by the petitioner, which are         summarised as under:    Writ Petition (Criminal) No. 160 of 2020     Page 5 of 128        ? Multiple FIRs arising out of the same incident are abuse of law,             and violate fundamental rights of the petitioner and freedom of             press, causing a chilling effect on the freedom of speech and             expression.         ? The FIRs are meant to harass and intimidate the petitioner; no             part of ‘cause of action’ has arisen in the areas where the FIRs             were lodged.         ? On interpretation of Sections 153A, 295A, and 505(2) of the             Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short, the ‘Penal Code’) and             Section 66-F of the Information Technology Act, 2000, (in short,             the ‘IT Act’), no offence whatsoever can be made out; the             allegations are based upon utterances in isolation by picking up             select words and not on the programme as a whole; the             petitioner did not have any malicious intent and mens rea to             outrage religious beliefs and feelings; the programme has to be             judged from the standard of a reasonable and strong-minded             person and at best the words exhibit carelessness without any             deliberate and malicious intent, which fall outside the ambit of             Sections 153A, 295A and 505(2) of the Penal Code.     Writ Petition (Criminal) No. 160 of 2020   Page 6 of 128        ? In the alternative, it is submitted that a case of trifle or minor             harm is made out, which would be covered by Section 95 of the             Penal Code.           ? Again, in the alternative, it is submitted that all the FIRs should             be clubbed and transferred to Noida or Delhi.

The prayers made by the petitioner are opposed by the states of         Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh, and the         private respondents. The informants submit that the petitioner is a         habitual offender and has on numerous earlier occasions offered         similar apologies. The petitioner had twice repeated the words         ‘aakrantak Chishti aya,’ followed by the words ‘lootera Chishti aya’.         This assertion on three occasions conveys and reflects the         intention of the petitioner, who had described Khwaja Moinuddin         Chishti as an invader, terrorist and robber who had come to India         to convert its population to Islam. The pretext of inadvertent         mistake is an afterthought and a sham and unreal defence.   31    (1996) 7 SCC 705 32    1966 SCR 123. 33    1993 (27) DRJ 357. 34    (2003) 6 SCC 175 35    AIR 1960 SC 633 36    (2001) 6 SCC 181 37    AIR 1957 SC 896  Writ Petition (Criminal) No. 160 of 2020   Page 9 of 128        Respondent No.9, namely, Saber Chausa Mohd. Naseer, in his         affidavit has stated that the name of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti as         a Sufi Saint was taken by one of the panelists when the topic of         conversion was being debated. The panelist had gone on record to         state that the conversions at the time of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti         happened for moral, religious and spiritual reasons and the         devotees and followers of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti were inspired         by his teachings. The affidavit also states that the discussion at         that time was not in relation to Mughals or with reference to         Aurangzeb or Allaudin Khilji. Further, the petitioner had tampered         with the broadcast of the debate uploaded on YouTube on 16 th         June, 2020, by deliberately deleting the part wherein the petitioner         had used the word ‘aakrantak Chishti’ (twice) and ‘lootera Chishti’.         These acts of sieving out of offensive portions, and the subsequent         apology were after the petitioner had learnt about the protests and         registration of the FIRs at Ajmer and other places. The         respondents claim that the apology is not genuine but an act of         self-defence. FIR at Ajmer was registered on 16 th June, 2020 at         11:58 p.m. whereas the first apology (via Twitter) of the petitioner         appeared on 17th June, 2020, at 12:12 a.m., i.e., nearly 30 hours         after the live telecast of the show where offensive words were         uttered by the petitioner.  Writ Petition (Criminal) No. 160 of 2020   Page 10 of 128 10.    The points raised by the respondents can be summarised as         under:         ? The petition ought to be dismissed as Article 32 has been             invoked in a cavalier manner. Remedy under section 482 of the             Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereafter referred to as,           ‘Criminal Code’) was available to the petitioner. 38        ? The offending words were uttered thrice by the petitioner, which             shows his ill intention.39 The intention of the petitioner was to             create disharmony between the two faiths/groups and to incite           disorder.40        ? The debate was a staged program, where no experts or             historians were on the panel; the program was staged to malign           the Muslims and to promote hatred.41        ? The themes of the programs hosted by the Petitioner are           communal.42        ? The conduct of the petitioner was against norms of journalistic           standards.43        ? Petitioner uploaded an edited version of the video on Youtube,             where he had removed the part containing the offensive             speech. This was done after FIR was lodged as an attempt to             tamper/destroy the evidence.44 38    I.A. by Haji Syed Chisti, Khadim of Dargah; RESPONDENT NO. 9, 39    I.A. by Haji Syed Chisti, Khadim of Dargah; Respondent no. 9, Respondent no. 6 40    I.A. by Haji Syed Chisti, Khadim of Dargah 41    I.A. by Sajid Noormohammad Sheikh r/o Nashik, Maharashtra 42    Respondent no. 9, Respondent no. 10 43    Respondent no. 6 44    Respondent no. 9  Writ Petition (Criminal) No. 160 of 2020               Page 11 of 128         ? The Petitioner claimed that inadvertently he uttered “Chishti” in              place of “Khilji”, but there is no relation between these two              historical figures. Khwaja Chishti came to India in 1136 when              Md. Ghori was defeated by Prithvi Raj Chauhan for the first time              in the battle of Tarain. Whereas, Khiljis ruled in India from 1290              to    1320.      So     Khilji    and      Khwaja      Chishti   were   neither            contemporaries nor related to each other.45         ? Apology by the Petitioner was an afterthought. It came only              after the registration of FIR.46 The petitioner did not apologize              initially and let the followers of Khwaja Chishti be outraged, in            order to gain popularity.47         ? The two persons, whose credentials the petitioner has              mentioned in the petition, to press that the members of the              community have forgiven him, is false. These two people as TV              personalities and nowhere represent the devotees of Khwaja            Chishti.48         ? FIR need not have an encyclopaedia of the event. Even if only              material facts have been disclosed, it is enough to continue with              criminal proceedings.49     45    Respondent no. 9 46    I.A. by Haji Syed Chisti, Khadim of Dargah; Respondent no. 9, 47    I.A. by Haji Syed Chisti, Khadim of Dargah; Respondent no. 9, 48    Respondent no. 9 49    Respondent no. 9  Writ Petition (Criminal) No. 160 of 2020                Page 12 of 128        ? Some communal elements in Maharashtra, after the broadcast             of the utterances by the Petitioner, used this opportunity and           started circulating this video to spread hatred. 50        ? Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution is subject to express           limitations under Article 19(2) of the Constitution.        ? The police should be permitted to file report under Section 173             of the Criminal Code and court should frame the charges. Then             only the petitioner would get the opportunity to defend himself in           the court.51        ?

The Show and Debate  11.       Before we examine the first prayer, we must take notice of the fact            that the transcript filed by the petitioner with the original writ            petition and the amended writ petitions is not the true and correct            transcript. As per these transcripts the petitioner is stated to have            only uttered the words “Akranta Chishti came... Lootera Chishti            came after then religion changed”. However, in the transcript filed            by the petitioner on 8th July, 2020, it is accepted that the petitioner            had used the words ‘Akranta Chishti’ not once but twice. This is the  55      Respondent no. 4 56      (2005) 13 SCC 540  Writ Petition (Criminal) No. 160 of 2020       Page 14 of 128        correct version. The petitioner accepts that the topic of debate was         relating to the challenge posed by a Hindu priest organisation to         the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991, according to         which the de facto position of religious places as on 15 th August,         1947 could not be changed or altered, though Ayodhya was kept         out of the ambit of the Act, and this petition was opposed by a         Muslim organisation stating that if notice is issued there would be         widespread fear among the Muslim community. After the prelude         initiating the debate, the petitioner, as per the transcript, had stated         “Today, this will be the key issue of the debate... Ayodhya Verdict         delivered, Why Kashi-Mathura issue left unresolved?... asking         Hindu Priests!”. The petitioner as per the transcript had then         declaimed:                    “Now analyse the legal position of Kashi Mathura                   issue...Hindu Priest organisation has reached Supreme                   Court against Places of Worship (Special Provisions)                   Act, 1991...According to this Act of 1946, the de facto                   position of any religious place could not be altered in                   any condition...According to Act a mosque could not be                   changed into temple or a temple could not be changed                   into mosque...This is impossible...The Ayodhya issue                   was out of this ambit as it was already in litigation. The                   Ayodhya issue was 100 year old dispute...The priest                   organisation says that Places of Worship (Special                   Provisions) Act, 1991 is against the Hindus...Today we                   are not debating the issue of Kashi or Mathura...we are                   debating the Places of Worship (Special Provisions)                   Act, 1991...What changes should be made in this                   Act?...if the arguments of Hindu Priests to be believed.”    Writ Petition (Criminal) No. 160 of 2020        Page 15 of 128 12.    We must also at this stage itself reproduce portions of the debate,         including the portion which the petitioner seeks to rely upon:                    “I don’t want to make this debate a hot topic between                   Hindu-Muslim community...I would like to discuss the                   provisions of this Act...First, I am going to ask                   questions to Mahant Naval Kishore Das Ji...Naval                   ji...Why do you want a change to the provisions of this                   Act?...The indication is clear...Ayodhya Jhanki                   Hai...Mathura Kashi Baaki Hain...This was the slogan                   of RSS, VHP and BJP...                               xx               xx                 xx                    Atiq-Ur-Rehman: Amish Ji, I’m welcoming your                   statements that you said you don’t want the ‘Hindu-                   Muslim’ saga on the matter. And I pay respect to                   Mahant Ji as well. He put his thoughts in a well-                   behaved manner. The Mahant Ji raised the question;                   ‘a mole in the thief’s beard’ (darta wo hai jinki dadi me                   tinka hota hai).                               xx               xx                 xx                    Amish Devgan:                   Point Number-2: You have said that with a clever                   step...Atiq-Ur-Rehman Ji I’ve listened your statement,                   you talked around 2-2½ inutes. You said that the verdict                   on the Ayodhya case came on the board cleverly. But, I                   want to refresh your memory; in the year of 1991-92                   when there had the slogan for the Ayodhya in the air the                   Sant Samaj, VHP, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and                   authentic persons of the Hindu Samaj used to say                   Ayodhya jhanki hai, Kashi-Mathura baki hai.                    So the demand is very old. The wish is too old. But                   when the Ayodhya’s wish was fulfilled then definitely                   after that verdict you are raising the question on your                   own ways. That is your take. Now I’m moving to Dr.                   Sudhandhu Trivedi, Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind are saying                   that if these types of petitions to be heard then thee will                   be a danger to the Muslim worship places.   Writ Petition (Criminal) No. 160 of 2020        Page 16 of 128                              xx               xx                 xx                    Amish Devgan: Dr. Trivedi, you made your point. I’m                   moving to Maulana Ali Kadri, he is senior guy. Kadri                   Sahab; I’m asking you straight. The Saints/Pujaris/                   Purohits/Mahants have a constitutional right that they                   file the writ in the Supreme Court against the 1991 Act.                   And they have right to talk about the Kashi and                   Mathura. But, if there is the Dukan is the convcern, Dar                   ki Dukan to pahle hi khol di. In that petition had said if                   there was a notice on it the Muslims would feel that                   their worship places were not safe. They feel fear.                   Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind’s petition says then who is                   opening the Dar ki Dukan. The Dar ki Dukan has                   already opened. This is the constitutional right?                               xx               xx                 xx                    Amish Devgan: Ali Qadri Sahab, why the Jamiat Ulema-                   e-Hind is hiding its failure? Why the organisation is                   saying that there will be a fear in the Muslims for their                   worship places due to the notice? If you want to show                   Dr. Sudhandhu Trivedi’s party’s failure and wish to                   expose the RSS and VHP, then please tell in 20                   seconds.                               xx               xx                 xx                    Amish Devgan: Mr. Vinod Bansal, there is a symbol of                   Om is showing behind you. Om, the symbol of peace.                   But Maulana Ali Kadri is saying; you want to spread                   Ashanti. You have defeated by corona and now seeking                   a base from the Mathura-Kashi issues. After these                   issues you will raise the Jama Masjid matter and Taj                   Mahal will be in your hit list.                               xx               xx                 xx                    Amish Devgan: Then how the Kashi-Mathura issue                   came into limelight?                    Vinod Bansal: There is clearly written that the 1947’s                   status to be maintained. Despite of that why the                   properties had transferred to the Waqf Board in a large  Writ Petition (Criminal) No. 160 of 2020        Page 17 of 128                   level? Waqf Board asked properties on the name of                   Mazars, Mosques and Graveyards several times. Is all                   the things are belong to their father (Ye sara inka, inke                   Baap ka hai?) This is not the right way.                    The first thing is, if the law had implemented, it should                   complete in a shape.                    And the second one is...is it not true that thousands of                   the Hindu temples had demolished? The Hindu had                   converted and humiliated in a large scale. There should                   be needed to rectify the historical wrongs. Why they are                   trying to escape from the reality.                    Amish Devgan: The historical wrong should rectify.                   Though several historians said the Eidgah and Krishan                   Janam Bhoomi in Mathura are situated adjacent to each                   other. Several historians claimed that in the 17 th century                   emperor Aurangzeb had demolished a temple and had                   built a mosque on the very same place. VHP’s Giriraj                   Kishor also said the same thing that on the place where                   the mosque is situated in Mathura, the Lord Krishnan                   had birthed on the same place. Besides that, he said                   several things. Now I want to move to Shadab                   Chauhan. He wishes to say something. Please go                   ahead.                    Shadab Chauhan: Peace Party pay respect to the                   Constitution of India and the social harmony. So, we                   have filed the curative petition for the justice. Now we                   will talk about Kashi and Mathura. After defeating from                   the coronavirus, government is trying to divert the                   nation’s attention by raising the issue of Kashi and                   Mathura.                    And now I’m saying with the challenge that there should                   not be any ‘nanga-nach’ like the 1992, on the name "

What is the interplay between the provisions of the           Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter referred to as           “CrPC” for short) and the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940           (hereinafter referred to as “the Act” for short)?           Whether Signature Not Verified  Digitally signed by           in respect of offences falling under chapter IV of the Act, ASHA SUNDRIYAL Date: 2020.08.28 19:27:16 IST Reason:                                                    1 a FIR can be registered under Section 154 of the CrPC and  the case investigated or whether Section 32 of the Act  supplants the procedure for investigation of offences under  CrPC and the taking of cognizance of an offence under  Section 190 of the CrPC? Still further, can the Inspector  under the Act, arrest a person in connection with an offence  under Chapter IV of the Act.   2.   One Naushad Khan made an online complaint on 22.2.2018.  The Commissioner (Food Protection and Drugs) directed  enquiry and the Drug Inspector, Mau, U.P. along with two  others conducted an inspection at the Sharda Narayan Clinic  and Pharmacy and the respondent No.1 was directed to show  papers in respect of medicines stored in the shop.        The  first respondent according to the appellant stated that he  did not have any license though he was the owner of the  medical store and that he had stored the medicines without  proper license. Thereby, he has committed offence under  Section 18 and 27 of the Act.   On the basis of recovery made,  an FIR came to be lodged on 22.6.2018 purporting to be under                                   2 Section 18 (a)(i) and Section 27 of the Act.                      The  complainant it may be noted is none other than the Drugs  Inspector. The respondent filed a writ petition for  quashing the FIR and not to arrest him.               The appellant,  viz., the Union of India through the Secretary, Ministry  of Health and Family Welfare was not made a party to the  writ petition.    The respondents in the writ petition were  the Superintendent of Police, the Station House Officer and  the Drugs Inspector, Mau in his personal capacity. This is  apart from the State of U.P. which was made the first  respondent.    It is pointed out by the appellant that the  High Court issued notice seeking presence of the appellant.  The High Court by the impugned order had allowed the writ  petition and quashed the FIR.          In short, the reasoning of  the High Court is that under the Act Section 32 must be  scrupulously     observed   and       it   is   the   mechanism   for  prosecuting offences and there is no scope for registration  of a FIR under CrPC.                                       3 FINDINGS OF THE HIGH COURT   3.   The High Court referred to Section 32 of the Act and  found that only an Inspector, a Gazetted Officer conferred  with authority, a person aggrieved or recognized consumer  organization is eligible to make a complaint.      The court  adverted to the other provisions of the Act including  Sections 22, 23, 25 and 27 apart from Section 32 and found  that the Act clearly lays down a complete code for the trial  of offences committed in respect of Drugs and Cosmetics.  The Act was a special Act enacted for the trial of offences  committed under the Act.       No other provision would be  applicable as the Act had an overriding effect over all  Acts.   The provisions of the CrPC would not be applicable  except as provided in the Act itself.      Since the lodging  of an FIR is under Section 154 of the CrPC, the said  provision would not be invokable.        It further held as  follows:             “21. In this Act, the procedure for launching            a prosecution has been clearly laid down            saying that prosecution under this Act can be            initiated only on a complaint made by an                                4           authorized Inspector or other authorized           persons defined under Section 32, who is           supposed to follow the entire procedure as           narrated above. By no stretch of imagination           could the concerned Inspector have lodged an           F.I.R. in this case and authorize the police           to make investigation in this case.”   4.   It was further held that the lodging of the FIR is  absolutely barred and FIR deserved to be quashed.         The  court also directed the issue of notice to the Inspector  who had gone to lodge the FIR, despite there being a special  provision for launching the prosecution and explanation was  sought.   Still further it was directed as follows:             “23. We, accordingly, allow this petition           and quash the F.I.R. and simultaneously it is           further directed that notice shall be issued           to the concerned Inspector by the Competent           Authority to show cause as to why he           deliberately lodged an F.I.R. when there is           specific provision for prosecuting the           accused by lodging a complaint. The           explanation and action taken against him,           shall be forwarded to the Court by the           Competent Authority within 8 weeks from today           through Registrar General of this Court who           shall place the same before us for perusal in           our chambers as soon as the same is received           by Registrar General. We further grant           liberty to the respondent no. 4 to initiate           criminal proceedings in accordance with the                               5          procedure laid down under this Act forthwith          against the petitioner.           24. Registrar General to sent a certified          copy of this order to Principal Secretary,          Food   Safety and    Drug Administration,          Government of U.P. for his necessary          information and follow up action. It is          further directed that Principal Secretary,          Food   Safety and    Drug Administration,          Government of U.P. shall notify such          direction to all the D.Ms. of the State so          that no such error recurs.”   5.   We heard Ms. Pinky Anand, learned Additional Solicitor  General appearing on behalf of the appellant.      We also  heard Shri S. Nagamuthu, learned Senior Counsel, whom we  appointed as Amicus Curiae.    SUBMISSIONS OF THE APPELLANT   6.   Ms. Pinky Anand, learned Additional Solicitor General  would submit that the High Court was in error in holding  that FIR under CrPC cannot be lodged in respect of the Act.  She drew our attention to Section 36 AC of the Act.  Thereunder, as we shall see in greater detail, certain  offences under the Act have been declared to be cognizable                                6 offences.    She would point out that once these offences are  declared as cognizable offences it is inconceivable that  a FIR cannot be lodged under the CrPC in regard to the same.  She drew our attention to Section 4 and 5 of the CrPC.         She  contended that there is nothing in the Act which detracted  from a FIR being registered in regard to offences under the  Act. Regarding the consequences flowing from Section 32 of  the Act, it is her contention that the High Court fell in  error in ignoring Section 36AC of the Act.             It is her  complaint that the Act contemplated curbing of various  highly undesirable activities posing a great threat to the  health and the safety of citizens as can be gleaned from  the grave offences which have been created under the Act.  In   fact,   it   is   pointed   out   that   many   cases   where  investigation was carried out on the basis of FIR lodged  under the Act will witness unmerited burial and offenders  would go scot free if the impugned judgment of the High Court  is allowed to stand.     There is no bar under the Act to the  registration of FIR under CrPC.                                     7 7.     Shri Nagamuthu, learned senior counsel submitted that  having regard to the scheme of the Act and Section 32, in  particular, the judgment of the High Court is only to be  supported.       He    drew   our   attention   to   the   following  judgments:    a. Jeewan Kumar Raut and another v. CBI1;  b. State (NCT of Delhi) v. Sanjay2.    8.     He also referred to the judgment of this Court in Kanwar  Pal Singh v. State of Uttar Pradesh and another in Criminal  Appeal No.1920 of 2019.         He would submit that as far as  offences falling within the ambit of Section 36AC are  concerned, a FIR under Section 154 of the CrPC is not  contemplated and cannot be registered.          The mere fact that  Section 36 AC of the Act declares certain offences under  the Act cognizable would not mean that the scheme of Section  32 of the Act can be jettisoned.         He would point out that  1   (2009) 7 SCC 526 2   (2014) 9 SCC 772                                      8 prosecution can be launched only in the manner provided  under the Act in regard to offences under the Act covered  by Section 32.    The institution of the prosecution can be  only at the instance of the persons named in the said  section.   He points out that Section 32 came to be amended  at the same time as Section 36 AC was inserted.       Nothing  prevented the Legislature if it so desired to provide that  the   offences    falling   under   Section   32   should   be  investigated in the manner provided under the provisions  of the CRPC namely by lodging a FIR and after investigating  the offences by filing a report within the meaning of  Section 173 of the CrPC.     The fact that such a procedure  was not contemplated by the Legislature is clear from the  fact that under the pre amended regime, three out of four  categories mentioned in the present amended avtaar were  already present and the amendment added only one more to  the categories of persons who alone could institute the  prosecution.     In fact, as regards Section 36 AC declaring  certain offences under the Act to be cognizable, he drew  our attention to the second part of the first schedule of                                9 the CrPC.   He contended inter alia that even without the  aid of Section 36 AC, the offences under Section 27(1)(a)  and 27(1)(c) were cognizable having regard to the term of  imprisonment provided as punishment for the same. Nothing  turned on the offence being cognizable except apprehension  of the offender without the aid of a warrant.       He would  submit that in regard to the offences embraced by Section  32, an F.I.R. within the meaning of the CrPC is not  contemplated but he was at pains to point out that this did  not stand in the way of an F.I.R. being lodged if the  offence constituted a distinct offence under any other law.  In such a scenario, while the lodging of the F.I.R. in regard  to the offences covered by Section 32 would be impermissible  the Officer would be within his powers if he were to register  an F.I.R. and proceed to investigate offences other than  the offence falling under Section 32, should they be  cognizable. In this case, he would submit that the offence  alleged is under Section 27 (1)(b) of the Act which squarely  fell within the four walls of Section 32. So, also Section  18 prohibiting certain acts fell in Chapter IV of the Act,                               10 thus, attracting Section 32. In regard to these offences,  Section 32 constitutes a bar for the registration of an  F.I.R. under CrPC and the investigation as an ordinary case.   9.   In reply to submission of learned Amicus Curiae,  Ms. Pinky Anand, learned Additional Solicitor General, drew  our attention to Section 36AC and reiterated that neither  the CrPC nor the Act constitute a stumbling block to the  lodging of an FIR.   She also drew our attention to Section  13 of the Act. It is pointed out that Section 13 falls under  Chapter III. She contended that the Act contemplated a  Special Court to deal with the offences under the Act. The  procedure leading to the institution of the prosecution  case must be governed by the provisions of the CrPC, runs  her argument.    ANALYSIS   10. The Act purports to achieve the object of regulating the import, manufacture, distribution and sale of drugs and                                 11 cosmetics. The word Drugs has been defined in Section 3(b).  Section 3(e) defines Inspector:               “3 Definitions. —In this Act, unless there           is anything repugnant in the subject or           context,—           (e) “Inspector” means—           (i) in relation to Ayurvedic, Siddha or           Unani drug, an Inspector appointed by the           Central Government or a State Government           under section 33G; and           (ii) in relation to any other drug or           cosmetic, an Inspector appointed by the           Central Government or a State Government           under section 21;    11. Chapter III contains provisions which provide for deeming   definitions   of    misbranded   drugs,   adulterated  drugs, spurious drugs, misbranded cosmetics and spurious  cosmetics for the purpose of Chapter III. Section 13  provides for offences arising out of imports. Chapter IV  falls under the chapter heading “Manufacture, Sale and  Distribution   of   Drugs    and   Cosmetics”.   Interestingly,  misbranded   drugs,   adulterated     drugs,   spurious   drugs,                                  12 misbranded cosmetics and spurious cosmetics, adulterated  cosmetics are defined by provisions found in Chapter IV for  the purpose of Chapter IV. Section 18 contemplates that from  such date as may be fixed by the State Government,  manufacture for sale or distribution, or to sell, or stock  or exhibit or offer for sale or distribution of drugs  misbranded, adulterated, spurious drugs and cosmetics  inter alia are prohibited. Section 21 reads as follows:            “21. Inspectors.—        (1) The Central Government or a State        Government may by notification in the        Official Gazette, appoint such persons as        it thinks fit, having the prescribed        qualifications, to be Inspectors for such        areas as may be assigned to them by the        Central   Government    or   the    State        Government, as the case may be.        (2) The powers which may be exercised by an        Inspector and the duties which may be        performed by him, the drugs or [classes of        drugs or cosmetics or classes of cosmetics]        in relation to which and the conditions,        limitations or restrictions subject to        which, such powers and duties may be        exercised or performed shall be such as may        be prescribed.                               13        (3) No person who has any financial        interest in the import, manufacture or sale        of drugs or cosmetics shall be appointed to        be an Inspector under this section.        (4) Every Inspector shall be deemed to be        a public servant within the meaning of        section 21 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of        1860), and shall be officially subordinate        to such authority, having the prescribed        qualifications,]    as    the    Government        appointing him may specify in this behalf.”                              (Emphasis supplied)     12. It is necessary to notice the rules relevant in this regard. Rule (49) deals with qualifications of Inspectors.  It reads as follows: -            “49. Qualifications of Inspectors. —A person         who is appointed an Inspector under the Act         shall be a person who has a degree in Pharmacy         or Pharmaceutical Sciences or Medicine with         specialisation in Clinical Pharmacology or         Microbiology from a University established         in India by law: Provided that only those         Inspectors—         (i) who have not less than 18 months’         experience in the manufacture of at least one         of the substances specified in Schedule C, or                                14         (ii) who have not less than 18 months’         experience in testing of at least one of the         substances in Schedule C in a laboratory         approved for this purpose by the licensing         authority, or         (iii) who have gained experience of not less         than three years in the inspection of firm         manufacturing   any   of    the  substances         specified in Schedule C during the tenure of         their services as Drugs Inspectors; shall be         authorised to inspect the manufacture of the         substances mentioned in Schedule C:                Provided further that the requirement as         to the academic qualification shall not apply         to persons appointed as Inspectors on or         before the 18th day of October, 1993.”       Rule (51) deals with duties of Inspectors in regard to  sale. It reads as follows:          “51. Duties of Inspectors of premises         licensed   for    sale.—Subject    to   the         instructions of the controlling authority,         it shall be the duty of an Inspector         authorized to inspect premises licensed for         the sale of drugs—         (1) to inspect not less than once a year all         establishments licensed for the sale of drugs         within the area assigned to him;                                  15 (2) to satisfy himself that the conditions of the licences are being observed;  (3) to procure and send for test or analysis, if necessary, imported packages which he has reason to suspect contain drugs being sold or stocked    or   exhibited    for    sale   in contravention of the provisions of the Act or rules thereunder;  (4) to investigate any complaint in writing which may be made to him;  (5) to institute prosecutions in respect of breaches of the Act and rules thereunder;  (6) to maintain a record of all inspections made and action taken by him in the performance of his duties, including the taking of samples and the seizure of stocks, and to submit copies of such record to the controlling authority;   (7) to make such enquiries and inspections as may be necessary to detect the sale of drugs in contravention of the Act;  (8) when so authorized by the State Government, to detain imported packages which he has reason to suspect contain drugs, the import of which is prohibited.”                        16     Rule (52) deals with duties of Inspectors in regard to  manufacturer. It reads as follows:              “52. Duties of inspectors specially         authorised to inspect the manufacture of         drugs or cosmetics. —Subject to the         instructions of the controlling authority it         shall be the duty of an Inspector authorized         to inspect the manufacture of drugs—         (1) to inspect [not less than once a year],         all premises licensed for manufacture of         drugs or cosmetics within the area allotted         to him to satisfy himself that the conditions         of the licence and provisions of the Act and         Rules thereunder are being observed;         (2) in the case of establishments licensed to         manufacture products specified in Schedules         C and C (1) to inspect the plant and the         process of manufacture, the means employed         for standardizing and testing the drug, the         methods and place of storage, the technical         qualifications of the staff employed and all         details of location, construction and         administration of the establishment likely         to affect the potency or purity of the         product;           (3) to send forthwith to the controlling         authority after each inspection a detailed         report indicating the conditions of the         licence and provisions of the Act and rules         thereunder which are being observed and the                              17         conditions and provisions, if any, which are         not being observed;         (4) to take samples of the drugs manufactured         on the premises and send them for test or         analysis in accordance with these Rules;         (5) to institute prosecutions in respect of         breaches of the Act and rules thereunder.”      Section 22 deals with the powers of the Inspector.  reads as follows:           “22. Powers of Inspectors.—(1) Subject to         the provisions of section 23 and of any rules         made by the Central Government in this         behalf, an Inspector may, within the local         limits of the area for which he is         appointed,—"" (a) inspect,—""         (i) any premises wherein any drug or cosmetic         is being manufactured and the means employed         for standardising and testing the drug or         cosmetic;        (ii) any premises wherein any drug        or         cosmetic is being sold, or stocked        or         exhibited   or  offered for  sale,        or         distributed;         (b) take samples of any drug or cosmetic,—         (i) which is being manufactured or being sold         or is stocked or exhibited or offered for         sale, or is being distributed;         (ii) from any person who is in the course of         conveying, delivering or preparing to                               18 deliver such drug or cosmetic to a purchaser or a consignee; (c) at all reasonable times, with such assistance, if any, as he considers necessary,— (i) search any person, who, he has reason to believe, has secreted about his person, any drug or cosmetic in respect of which an offence under this Chapter has been, or is being, committed; or (ii) enter and search any place in which he has reason to believe that an offence under this Chapter has been, or is being, committed; or (iii) stop and search any vehicle, vessel or other conveyance which, he has reason to believe, is being used for carrying any drug or cosmetic in respect of which an offence under this Chapter has been, or is being, committed, and order in writing the person in possession of the drug or cosmetic in respect of which the offence has been, or is being, committed, not to dispose of any stock of such drug or cosmetic for a specified period not exceeding twenty days, or, unless the alleged offence is such that the defect may be removed by the possessor of the drug or cosmetic, seize the stock of such drug or cosmetic and any substance or article by means of which the offence has been, or is being, committed or which may be employed for the commission of such offence;                      19 (cc) examine any record, register, document or any other material object found with any person, or in any place, vehicle, vessel or other conveyance referred to in clause (c), and seize the same if he has reason to believe that it may furnish evidence of the commission of an offence punishable under this Act or the Rules made thereunder; (cca) require any person to produce any record, register, or other document relating to the manufacture for sale or for distribution, stocking, exhibition for sale, offer for sale or distribution of any drug or cosmetic in respect of which he has reason to believe that an offence under this Chapter has been, or is being, committed;   (d) exercise such other powers as may be necessary for carrying out the purposes of this Chapter or any rules made thereunder.   22(2)The provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974)] shall, so far as may be, apply to any search or seizure under this Chapter as they apply to any search or seizure made under the authority of a warrant issued under section 94 of the said Code. (2A) Every record, register or other document seized under clause (cc) or produced under clause (cca) shall be returned to the person, from whom they were seized or who produce the same, within a period of twenty days of the date of such seizure or production, as the case may be, after copies thereof or extracts                     20            therefrom certified by that person, in such            manner as may be prescribed, have been taken.            (3)If any person wilfully obstructs an            Inspector in the exercise of the powers            conferred upon by or under this Chapter or            refuses to produce any record, register or            other document when so required under clause            (cca) of sub-section (1), he shall be            punishable with imprisonment which may            extend to three years or with fine, or with            both.”                                     (Emphasis supplied)   13. Section 23 provides for the procedure to be followed by the Inspector. It includes the tendering of fair price  when a sample is taken of a drug or cosmetic under the  Chapter. There are various other provisions regarding the  procedure to be followed by the Inspector which includes  seizure of record/ register, documents or other material  objects and the need to notify a judicial Magistrate [See  Section 23(6)].   14. Section 27 provides for penalty for manufacture, sale etc. of drug in contravention of Chapter IV. It reads as  follows:                                   21 “27. Penalty for manufacture, sale, etc., of drugs in contravention of this Chapter.- Whoever, himself or by any other person on his behalf, manufactures for sale or for distribution, or sells, or stocks or exhibits or offers for sale or distributes,- (a) any drug deemed to be adulterated under     section    17A    or    spurious    under     section 17B and which when used by any     person for or in the diagnosis,     treatment, mitigation, or prevention of     any disease or disorder is likely to     cause his death or is likely to cause     such harm on his body as would amount to     grievous hurt within the meaning of     section 320 of the Indian Penal Code (45     of 1860), solely on account of such drug     being adulterated or spurious or not of     standard quality, as the case may be,     shall be punishable with imprisonment     for a term which shall not be less than     ten years but which may extend to     imprisonment for life and shall also be     liable to fine which shall not be less     than ten lakh rupees or three times value     of the drugs confiscated, whichever is     more:       Provided that the fine imposed on and     released from, the person convicted     under this clause shall be paid, by way     of compensation, to the person who had     used the adulterated or spurious drugs     referred to in this clause:       Provided further that where the use of     the adulterated or spurious drugs     referred to in this clause has caused the                      22 death of a person who used such drugs, the fine imposed on and realised from, the person convicted under this clause, shall be paid to the relative of the person who had died due to the use of the adulterated or spurious drugs referred to in this clause.

In the reference, the validity of the Government Office Ms. No.3           dated 10.1.2000 issued by the erstwhile State of Andhra Pradesh           providing 100% reservation to the Scheduled Tribe candidates out of           whom 33.1/3% shall be women for the post of teachers in the schools           in the scheduled areas in the State of Andhra Pradesh, is under           challenge.            2.              Several questions have been referred for consideration in the           order dated 11.1.2016. We have renumbered question nos.1(a)(b)(c)           and (d) based on interconnection. The questions are as follows: Signature Not Verified  Digitally signed by JAYANT KUMAR ARORA Date: 2020.04.22 18:03:05 IST Reason:                             “(1) What is the scope of paragraph 5(1), Schedule V to the                             Constitution of India?                                         2          (a) Does the provision empower the Governor to make a new         law?         (b) Does the power extend to subordinate legislation?         (c) Can the exercise of the power conferred therein override         fundamental rights guaranteed under Part III?          (d) Does the exercise of such power override any parallel         exercise of power by the President under Article 371D?          (2) Whether 100% reservation is permissible under the         Constitution?          (3) Whether the notification merely contemplates a classification         under Article 16(1) and not reservation under Article 16(4)?          (4) Whether the conditions of eligibility (i.e., origin and cut-off         date) to avail the benefit of reservation in the notification are         reasonable?""  3.   The facts in the backdrop project that by G.O.Ms. No.275 dated  5.11.1986, issued by the Governor in exercise of power under para  5(1) of Schedule V to the Constitution of India, directing the posts of  teachers in educational institutions in the scheduled tribe areas shall  be reserved for Scheduled Tribes only notwithstanding anything  contained in any other order or rule or law in force. The Andhra  Pradesh Administrative Tribunal (for short “the tribunal”) quashed the  notification by order dated 25.8.1989. The order was questioned in  this Court in C.A. Nos.2305­06/1991, which was dismissed as  withdrawn on 20.3.1998.   4.   Another G.O.Ms. No.73 dated 25.4.1987 was issued to amend  GOMs. No.275 dated 5.11.1986 to allow the appointment of non­  tribals to hold the posts of teachers in the scheduled areas till such                                     3  time the qualified local tribals were not made available. After that,  non­tribals who were appointed as teachers in the scheduled areas  filed Writ Petition No.5276/1993 in the High Court of Andhra Pradesh  at Hyderabad against termination of their services. The same was  allowed vide judgment and order dated 5.6.1996 and GOMs. No.73  dated 25.4.1987, and the advertisements were held to be violative of  Article 14 of the Constitution of India. In writ appeal, the order of the  Single Bench was set aside by the Division Bench vide judgment and  order dated 20.8.1997. The decision in W.P. No.16198/1988 thus  prevailed. The non­tribal appointees preferred Civil Appeal 6437/1998  before this Court, which was allowed on 18.12.1998.   5.   After this Court rendered the decision on 18.12.1998, the  Government issued a fresh notification vide GOMs. No. 3 dated  10.1.2000 effectively providing for 100% reservation in respect of  appointment to the posts of teachers in the scheduled areas. The  tribunal set aside the GOMs. Aggrieved thereby, writ petitions were  filed in the High Court, a 3­Judge Bench by majority upheld the  validity of G.O. Aggrieved by the same, the appeals have been  preferred.   6.   The majority view opined that historically scheduled areas were  treated   specially,   and   affirmative   action   taken   was   in   the  constitutional spirit. The notification was a step for increasing literacy                                     4  in the scheduled areas and also aimed at providing the availability of  teachers in every school in the scheduled areas. 100% reservation can  be sustained on the ground that it was based on intelligible differentia,  and the classification has nexus with the object sought to be achieved.  The G.O. became necessary considering the phenomenal absenteeism  of the teachers in the schools situated in the scheduled areas and was  a step in aid to promote educational developments of tribals. In  extraordinary situations, reservation can exceed 50%. The Governor  possessed the power to issue the impugned notification under  Schedule V, para 5(1) of the Constitution. The same overrides all other  provisions of the Constitution, including Part III of the Constitution of  India.   7.   The High Court in the minority view opined that providing 100%  reservation for Scheduled Tribes in scheduled areas offends the spirit  of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India. The Governor is not  conferred power to make any law in derogation to Part III or other  provisions of the Constitution of India in the exercise of his power  under Clause I, Para 5 of Schedule V. It was also held that G.O.Ms.  No.3 is discriminatory as the same adversely affects not only the open  category candidates but also other Scheduled Castes, Scheduled  Tribes, and backward classes. It also opined that the reservation  under Article 16(4) should not exceed 50%. However, little relaxation                                           5  was permissible. The rules made under Article 309 of the Constitution  could not be treated as an Act of Parliament or State Legislature.   8.   G.O.Ms. No.3 dated 10.1.2000, validity of which is questioned,  reserved all posts in the educational institutions within the scheduled  areas in favour of the local Scheduled Tribes. The order is extracted  hereunder:           ""Whereas, under sub-paragraph (1) of paragraph 5 of the Fifth          Schedule to the Constitution of India, the Governor of Andhra          Pradesh may by public notification direct that any particular Act          of Parliament or of Legislature of the State shall not apply to the          Scheduled Areas or any part thereof in the State or shall apply to          a scheduled area or any part thereof subject to specified          exceptions and modifications;          2.

AND WHEREAS, the Andhra Pradesh Administrative          Tribunal in its order dated 25.8.1989 in R.P.Nos.6377 and 6379          of 1988 quashed the orders issued in G.O.Ms.No.275, Social          Welfare Department dated 5.11.1986 on the ground that the          notification issued under sub-paragraph (1) of paragraph 5 of the          Fifth Scheduled to the Constitution of India does not reflect the          existence of either a State or a Central Legislation referable for          issuing such notification;          4. AND WHEREAS, the Division Bench of the High Court of          Andhra Pradesh in its judgement dated 20-8-1997 in Writ Appeal          No.874 of 1997 filed by the Project Officer, I.T.D.A.,          Rampachodayaram, East Godavari District, directed to continue          the petitioners respondents in their respective posts of teachers          without any break as temporary employees until replaced by the                                 6  qualified local tribals as and when such tribals are available to fill up those posts; 5. AND WHEREAS, the Andhra Pradesh Administrative Tribunal subsequently while disposing of O.A.No.4598/97 in its order dt.22.9.1997 directed the respondents to follow the statutory rules while making recruitment to the posts of Secondary Grade Teachers and also Telugu Pandits, Grade. I in Agency Areas without taking into consideration of the orders issued in G.O.Ms.No.275, Social Welfare Department, dated 5.11.1986. 6. AND WHEREAS, the Supreme Court of India while allowing Civil Appeal No.6437/98 in its order dated 18th December 1998, set aside the orders of the Andhra Pradesh Administrative Tribunal on the ground that the State withdraw the appeals arising out of the S.L.P. Nos.14562-63 of 1989: 7. AND WHEREAS, the Government considers that rule 4 (b) of the Andhra Pradesh School Educational Subordinate Service Rules, 1992 and rule 22A of the Andhra Pradesh State and Subordinate Service Rules, 1996 shall be modified to the extent that only Scheduled Tribe Women shall be appointed in Scheduled Areas against 33 1/3% reservation in respect of direct recruitment; 8. AND WHEREAS, the consultation of the Tribes Advisory Council has been made as required under sub-paragraph (5) of paragraph 5 of the Fifth Schedule to the constitution of India.  9. AND WHEREAS, the Government of Andhra Pradesh in order to strengthen the educational infrastructure in the Scheduled Areas, to promote educational development of Tribals, to solve the phenomenal absenteeism of Teachers in the Schools situated in Scheduled Areas and with a view to protect the interests of local tribals have decided to reserve the posts of teachers in favour of local Scheduled Tribes candidates;  10. AND WHEREAS, the Government considered to re-issue the said orders retrospectively from 5.11.1986 keeping in view the provisions of sub-paragraph (1) of paragraph 5 of Fifth Schedule to the Constitution;  11.

(emphasis supplied)  9.   In the notification various provisions have been mentioned.  Section 78 of the A.P. Education Act, 1982 provides for the  constitution of educational service. It confers power upon the  Governor to make rules to regulate the classification, methods of  recruitment, conditions of service, pay and allowances and discipline  and conduct of the members of the educational service. Section 79  inter alia deals with dismissal, removal, reduction in rank and  suspension of the employees of private institutions. Section 169 of the                                           8  A.P.

The Andhra Pradesh State and Subordinate Service Rules, 1996  referred to in the notification were made by the State in exercise of the  power conferred under proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution of  India. Rule 22 of the Andhra Pradesh State and Subordinate Service  Rules, 1996 provides for reservation. Rule 22 is extracted hereunder:           “Special Representation (Reservation): (1) Reservation may be          made for appointments to a service, class or category in favour          of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Backward Classes,          Women, Physically handicapped, Meritorious Sportsman, Ex-          Servicemen and such other categories, as may be prescribed by          the Government from time to time, to the extent and in the          manner specified hereinafter in these rules or as the case may be,          in the special rules. The principle of reservation as hereinafter          provided shall apply all appointments to a service, class, or          category.           (i) by direct recruitment, except where the Government by a          General or Special Order made in this behalf, exempt such          service, class or category;           (ii) otherwise than by direct recruitment where the special rules          lay down specifically that the principle reservation in so far as it          relates to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes only shall          apply to such services, class, or category to the extent specified          therein.                                          9           (2)(a) The unit of appointments for the purpose of this rule shall          be one hundred vacancies, of which, fifteen shall be reserved for          scheduled for Scheduled Castes, six shall be reserved for          Scheduled Tribes, twenty-five shall be reserved for the          Backward Classes and the remaining fifty-four appointments          shall be made on the basis of open competition and subject to          Rule 22-A of these rules.           (e) Appointments under this rule shall be made in the order of          rotation specified below in a unit of hundred vacancies.           Rule     22-A:    Women    reservation   in    appointments:          Notwithstanding anything contained in these rules or special          rules or Ad hoc Rules:           (1) In the matter of direct recruitment to posts for which women          are better suited than men, preference shall be given to women:                   Provided that such absolute preference to women shall not          result in total exclusion of men in any category of posts.           (2) In the matter of direct recruitment to posts for which women          and men are equality suited, there shall be reservation to women          to an extent of 33 1/3 % of the posts in each category of Open          Competition, Backward Classes (Group-A), Backward Classes          (Group-B), Backward Classes (Group-C), Backward Classes          (Group-D), Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Physically          Handicapped and Ex-Servicemen quota.           (3) In the matter of direct recruitment to posts which are reserved          exclusively for being filled by women, they shall be filled by          women only.”        Six per cent reservation has been provided in the State for  Scheduled Tribes.   11.   The A.P. Regulation of Reservation and Appointment to Public  Services Act, 1997, was enacted to ensure that the reservation  mandated under Rule 22 is followed scrupulously. The Act intended to  punish the officers for violation of the rules of reservation. The Act did                                   10  not provide any percentage of the reservation to the Scheduled Castes,  Scheduled Tribes, and the backward classes. The reservations were  provided under Rules 22 and 22A of the Rules framed under Article  309.  ARGUMENTS  12.    It was submitted by Mr. C.S.N. Mohan Rao, Mr. G. Ramakrishna  Prasad and Mr. G.V.R. Choudhary, learned counsel and other learned  counsel for the appellants that the limited legislative power is  conferred on the Governor to modify the existing legislation made by  the Parliament or the State legislature under Para 5(1) of the Fifth  Schedule to the Constitution. The power to make regulation was  conferred under Para 5(2) of Schedule V. Under Para 5(1), there is no  such legislative power. The earlier G.O.Ms. of 1986 was quashed. After  that, the appeal preferred in this Court was withdrawn, and fresh G.O.  was issued, again perpetuating the illegality by providing a 100%  reservation.   13.    Learned counsel for the appellants argued that Article 371­D of  the Constitution contains special provisions concerning the State of  Andhra Pradesh, which has now been amended for Andhra Pradesh as  well as Telangana. After re­organisation of the States, the Article has  been amended in its application to Andhra Pradesh as well as  Telangana. Article 371D was promulgated given the geographical                                     11  disparities in the arena of public employment in the State of Andhra  Pradesh as candidates from certain districts were capturing a  disproportionately large number of posts, as such by way of the  Presidential Order issued under the said provisions, local cadres were  created for different parts of the State. The Presidential Order provided  for   reservation   on   district/zonal   basis   for   different   posts.   A  district/zone as the case may constitute a local area. A district is a  unit for teachers, and all the posts have been ordered to be filled by  scheduled tribe candidates in the scheduled areas in several districts.   14.   Learned counsel for the appellants argued that as per the  Presidential Order issued under Article 371D, aspiring candidates  could not apply outside the district or zone, as the case may be. Thus,  the incumbents cannot apply outside their districts where they are  residing. Their chances of obtaining public employment as against the  posts of teachers have been taken away. Thus, the G.O. transgresses  the Presidential Order issued under Article 371­D of the Constitution  as such the same is unconstitutional and could not prevail.   15.   Learned counsel for the appellants further argued that providing  100% reservation is not permissible because of the catena of decisions  rendered by this Court, to be referred later. Learned counsel  vehemently argued that it is an unfortunate reality that the law­  makers are resorting to reservations on political basis catering to vote­                                    12  bank, thereby ignoring the constitutional mandate to which they owe  allegiance. The reservation so provided is against the wishes of the  founding fathers of the Constitution. The reason employed of chronic  absenteeism in the schools, could not have been made the fulcrum  justifying 100% reservation. Merit has been ignored and whittled  down. The noble profession of teaching cannot be demeaned. There  cannot be a compromise with the standard of education in the garb of  cent percent reservation, and merit is a casualty. It tantamounts to  reverse discrimination. It cannot be said to be a case of classification,  but it is a case of reservation. It is highly unfair and unreasonable  action. The Constitution of India does not permit 100% reservation in  respect of any particular class or category to the total exclusion of  others. Reservation set out under Article 16 should not exceed the  limit of 50%.   16.   The G.O. would be counter­productive to the aim of the  Constitution in providing protective legislation, and the main thrust of  the reservation is to bring in the disadvantaged classes into the  mainstream of the society at large. The idea of the tribal students to be  taught by tribal teachers in the scheduled areas is akin to  compromising with the merit and quality of education and further put  the tribal children at a disadvantage and segregate them from the  mainstream.      Regarding the language barrier, learned counsel                                        13  argued that qualifications for teachers could be provided that they  should know the local language, a resident of a district invariably  knows the local language. In the impugned notification, no such  aspect was mentioned.   17.   Learned counsel on behalf of the appellants further argued that  Rules 22 and 22A of the Andhra Pradesh State and Subordinate  Service Rules, 1996 provides for reservation framed under proviso to  Article 309 of the Constitution. The legislature did not frame them.  Thus, it could not have been amended or modified by the Governor in  exercise of the power under Para 5(1) of Schedule V to the  Constitution being subordinate legislation. That apart, it was argued  that no new law could have been created within the realm of Para 5(1)  of Schedule V. The Acts mentioned in G.O.Ms. No.3/2000 did not deal  with reservation. The Act of 1997, provided for the reservation, was  not amended. Even by amending the same, 100% reservation could  not have been provided.   18.   The classification created within the scheduled tribes to benefit  only the candidates or their parents continuously residing in the  scheduled     areas     since     26.1.1950    is   arbitrary,   illegal,   and  discriminatory vis­à­vis the scheduled tribes also, besides other  categories.   The     executive    order    could   not   have   provided   the  reservation. The legislation was imperative to provide for a 100%                                   14  reservation. Testing the case on the anvil of the doctrine of basic  structure is not germane as it is not a case set up that provisions  under Para 5 of Schedule V are against the basic structure of the  Constitution. The provisions of Para 5 of Schedule V are not  questioned, but only the legality of the action taken thereunder. The  right of judicial review is available in case of any action taken, which  is per se illegal, arbitrary or violative of fundamental rights and sans  any basis.   19.   Concerning the non­obstante clause, it was argued that the  order under Para 5 of Schedule V could not have been issued in  contravention of Article 371D. It contravened the Presidential order.   20.   Dr. Rajeev Dhawan, learned senior counsel appearing for the  respondents, argued that the Constitution has a solicitude for  scheduled castes and scheduled tribes under various provisions  contained in Articles 15 and 16 and the Directive Principles contained  in Articles 37, 38, 47 and 51(A). There are special provisions carved  out providing reservation to SCs/ STs; there is National Commission  for Scheduled Tribes, Article 330 provides reservation of seats for SC/  ST in House of People,      Article 332 provides reservation in State  Assemblies, Article 335 provides to consider the claim of SCs/STs to  services, Article 338 provides for the constitution of National  Commission for Scheduled Castes and Article 338A provides for the                                     15  constitution of National Commission for Scheduled Tribes. Articles  339, 341, 342 and 334, are other provisions relating to SCs/ STs.  Articles 343D and 343(T)(h) provide reservation for SC/ST in  Panchayats.    21.    Learned senior counsel further argued that India's Constitution  is symmetrical and spatial for SCs/STs. In that view, the scheduled  areas are constituted under the provisions of Article 244 and  Schedules V and VI. The Constitution creates special classification.  Equality is a concept of anti­arbitrariness. The normal rule of 50%  reservation can be relaxed in appropriate cases that have precisely  been done by the Governor. Reservation can be made by executive  order. Reservations cannot be termed to be anti­meritarian. He urged  that   the    reservations   were   provided   due     to   discrimination,  disadvantage, and to share the State power. Elaborately referred to the  decision in Indra Sawhney & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors., (1992)  Supp. 3 SCC 217, it was argued that reservations could be  rectified/revised. It is not permissible to sub­divide the SCs and STs.  Article 16(4) aims at group backwardness. Strictly speaking, the  constitution of a Commission to enquire is not necessary for providing  further reservations, particularly for scheduled tribes in the scheduled  areas. The scope of judicial review is limited in such matters. He  referred to various dictums to be adverted to later.                                   16    22.   Dr. Rajeev Dhawan, learned senior counsel, lastly argued that  G.O.Ms. No.3/2000 is constitutionally valid, and the Court may, if so  advised, issue directions to the States to maintain oversight. The  purposes of Article 371D and Para 5 of Schedule V are entirely  different. He further argued that to trickle down the necessary  benefits, the remedy lies in following what is inelegantly called the  ""bottoms up"" approach. The malady can be addressed by empowering  Gram Sabhas, ensuring the right to information, and strengthening its  implementation. Learned senior counsel alternatively argued that in  case this Court concludes that the G.O. is to be quashed, the  appointments made should not be disturbed.   23.   Shri R. Venkataramani, learned senior counsel appearing for the  State of Andhra Pradesh, argued that the scheme of Schedule V, as a  whole, deserves to be dealt with on a special constitutional footing,  that is an exclusive constitutional enclave, free in its ambit to ensure  the promotion of the interests, concerns and the development of  scheduled areas. Paras 2 and 5 of the Fifth Schedule constitute its  essence. Para 2 enacts limitations on the executive power of the State  concerning the scheduled areas. Para 5 is a composite and particular  species of the enabling power, conferring on the Governor, legislative,  and administrative powers. The legislative and administrative powers  run seamlessly. For instance, the power under clause (1) of Para 5 to                                      17  extend a Central or State legislation to the scheduled area, ""subject to  exceptions   and   modifications,""   confer   a   power   to   amend   the  legislation. The power under clauses (1) and (2) operates in distinct  fields to achieve distinct purposes, each of them wide in their way. The  object to be achieved under clause (1) is to evaluate and assess the  relevance, fitness, or inappropriateness of any law in their application  to scheduled areas, the domain of policy with considerable latitude to  bring into force with modifications and exceptions any law.   24.   Shri R. Venkataramani, learned senior counsel further argued  that the scheduled areas and the tribes constitute a special class. This  special homogenous class can always be dealt with on a special basis.  The G.O. was not issued to favour the local scheduled tribes or to  discriminate against others intentionally. It was passed to advance the  educational interests of the scheduled areas, even if it otherwise  impinges upon the claims under Article 14 or 16(1), cannot be faulted.  Even if the G.O. advances a class interest, it cannot be subjected to  scrutiny under Articles 14 and 16(1).  25.   Shri R. Venkataramani further argued that there is no conflict  between Article 371D and Schedule V. The two operate in distinct  fields and achieve different purposes. The socio­economic experiments  drafted by the legislatures, and in this case by the Governor, cannot  be subjected to judicial scrutiny. It is wrong to suggest that the non­                                    18  obstante clause in Article 371­D    can annul the non­obstante clause  in Para 5 of the Fifth Schedule. Firstly, the two constitutional  provisions operate in distinct domains. Article 371­D was not enacted  to be a superimposition on Schedule V. Secondly, it is well settled that  if the object and purpose of legislation or provisions with respective  non­obstante clauses are distinct, the Court would not see any  conflict.   26.   Shri R. Venkataramani, learned senior counsel, also argued that  Schedule V is a complete Code by itself. It is not a case of reservation  at all. It is a classification made to ensure that the schools in the  scheduled areas function and promote the educational interest of the  tribal populace. The Governor took cognizance of the general non­  availability of teachers. The notification by prescribing that the  Scheduled Tribe teachers of the local areas should be the exclusive  component of the teaching element was looking at the local scheduled  tribe teacher as the best possible tool for ensuring the educational  interest of the scheduled areas. Learned senior counsel has referred to  various decisions, to be adverted later.   27.   Learned senior counsel further pointed out that the scheduled  area is extended over 31,485 sq. km. which is about 11% of the total  area of the State with more than 5938 villages distributed in  Srikakulam, Vizianagaram, Visakhapatnam, East Godavari, West                                       19  Godavari,    Khammam,      Warangal,       Adilabad   and   Mahaboobnagar  Districts. Scheduled Tribe students are at a disadvantageous position.  The non­attendance of teachers was more in the scheduled areas, so  to provide the facility of teaching, classification has been made. It  cannot be said to be a case of providing reservations. The Government  of Andhra Pradesh, Department of Tribal Welfare, has established  various categories of educational institutions to cater to the needs of  Scheduled Tribes children in the State.   28.   Learned senior counsel further submitted that the Government  of Andhra Pradesh, Department of Tribal Welfare, established various  categories of educational institutions to cater to the needs of  Scheduled Tribes children in the State, such as Gurukula Pathasalas,  Ashram schools, and residential, educational institutions, and the  method of appointment of the local tribe has yielded good results.    29.   Shri B. Adinarayana Rao, learned senior counsel appearing for  the State of Telangana, pointed out the history of scheduled areas  Ganjam and Vizagapatnam. The Act of 1839 declared agency areas of  Madras      Presidency,   providing    for   separate   administration   of  tribals/agency areas. In 1874, the Scheduled Districts Act, XIV was"

The Appellant/Complainant, Nirmala Kothari’s husband, Vinod Signature Not Verified   GEETA AHUJA Ray Kothari was owner of a Hyundai Elantra vehicle, registration no. Digitally signed by Date: 2020.03.04 15:39:02 IST Reason:                                                                            2  RJ36CA 0111, which was insured with the Insurance Company for a  sum of Rs.5,00,000/- .    3.   The said vehicle met with an accident with a tractor bearing no.  HR38K 3216, on 06.06.2010 as a result of which the Appellant’s  husband, Vinod Ray Kothari, who was the owner of the car, and his  daughter died and the vehicle was damaged. The driver of the vehicle,  Dharmendra Singh Chauhan got an FIR registered with the police. The  Respondent/ Insurance Company, on intimation having been given to  them, appointed a spot surveyor, and also a regular surveyor to carry  out survey in the matter, but the claim was rejected by them vide their  letter dated 28.03.2011. The Respondent/ Insurance Company stated in  the repudiation letter that the driver Dharmendra Singh Chauhan did not  have a proper driving licence at the time of the accident. The licence  produced by him, alleged to have been procured from the office of the  licencing authority, Sheikh Sarai, Delhi could not be verified, as the  concerned officer of the transport department returned their letter with  the endorsement that the record pertaining to the said licence was not  available. Alleging deficiency on the part of the Respondent/ Insurance                                                                              3  Company, the complainant filed a consumer complaint, seeking  directions to the Respondent/Insurance Company to pay the Insured  declared value (IDV) i.e. a sum of Rs. 5,00,000/- alongwith interest @  9% per annum from the date of filing the complaint till payment and also  to pay a sum of Rs. 50,000/- as compensation for mental agony and  Rs. 11,000/- as litigation cost. The District Forum vide their order dated  30.05.2012, allowed the said consumer complaint and directed  payment of an amount of Rs. 3,57,500/- to the complainant, as  assessed by the surveyor alongwith interest @ 9% p.a. and cost of  litigation of Rs. 2,500/-. Being aggrieved against the said order of the  District Forum, the Respondent/ Insurance Company challenged the  same by way of appeal before the State Commission, but the said  appeal having been dismissed vide impugned order dated 18.09.2015,  the   Respondent/    Insurance    Company      came     before   National  Commission by way of the Revision Petition No. 2835/2015.   4.    The complaint no. 227/2012 had been filed by the same  complainant Nirmala Kothari, against the Respondent/ Insurance  Company, requesting for compensation of Rs. 2,00,000/- as accident  claim with interest @ 9% per annum and compensation of Rs. 20,000/-                                                                                4  for mental agony and Rs. 11,000/- for cost of litigation.              The  Respondent/ Insurance Company repudiated the said claim also vide  their letter dated 14.02.2012 on the same ground that Dharmendra  Singh Chauhan, the driver of the vehicle did not possess a valid and  effective driving licence at the time of the accident in question.    5.    The consumer complaint no. 227/2012 was also allowed by the  District   Forum,     vide    order    dated     28.02.2013      and    the  Respondent/Insurance Company was directed to pay an amount of Rs.  2,00,000/- for personal accident claim along with interest @ 9% per  annum from the date of filing the complaint and the cost of litigation of  Rs. 2,500/-.   Being aggrieved against the said order of the District  Forum, the Respondent/ Insurance Company challenged the same by  way of appeal no. 366/2013 before the State Commission. The said  appeal having been dismissed vide impugned order dated 01.08.2016,  the Respondent/ Insurance Company came before the National  Commission by way of the Revision Petition No. 3053/2016.              The  National Commission absolved the Respondent/ Insurance Comapany  of its liability since no record of the licence of the Driver was found with                                                                                 5  the licencing authority. Thus, aggrieved the Appellant/Complainant has  come up in appeal.    6.    It is the case of the Respondent/ Insurance Company that in the  absence of a valid and effective driving licence with the driver, there  was fundamental breach of the terms and conditions of the insurance  policy in question and hence, the claim made by the Appellant/  Complainant was not payable. Whereas, it is argued by the Appellant/  Complainant that at the time of employing the driver, the documents like  driving licence etc. are generally checked but no one usually verifies the  genuineness of the same.    7.    Breach of conditions under Section 149(2)(a) of the Motor  Vehicles Act, 1988 absolves the insurer of its liability to the insured.  Section 149(2)(a)(ii) deals with the conditions regarding driving licence.  In case the vehicle at the time of accident is driven by a person who is  not duly licenced or by a person who has been disqualified from holding  or obtaining a driving licence during the period of disqualification, the  insurer is not liable for compensation. In the instant case it is a matter of                                                                                6  fact that no record of the licence bearing no. P03041288753070 was  found with the licensing authority.    8.    Having set forth the facts of the present case, the question of law  that arises for consideration is what is the extent of care/diligence  expected of the employer/insured while employing a driver? To answer  this question, we shall advert to the legal position regarding the liability  of the Insurance Company when the driver of the offending vehicle  possessed an invalid/fake driving licence. In the case of United India  Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Lehru & Ors. 1 a two Judge Bench of this court  has taken the view that the Insurance Company cannot be permitted to  avoid its liability on the ground that the person driving the vehicle at the  time of the accident was not duly licenced. It was further held that the  willful breach of the conditions of the policy should be established. The  law with this respect has been discussed in detail in the case of Pepsu  RTC vs. National Insurance Co. 2          We may extract the relevant  paragraph from the Judgment: (Pepsu case, SCC pp. 223-24, para10)     1 (2003) 3 SCC 338 : 2003 SCC (Cri) 641 2 (2013) 10 SCC 217                                                                            7            “In a claim for compensation, it is certainly open to the           insurer under Section 149(2)(a)(ii) to take a defence that           the driver of the vehicle involved in the accident was not           duly licensed. Once such a defence is taken, the onus is           on the insurer. But even after it is proved that the licence           possessed by the driver was a fake one, whether there is           liability on the insurer is the moot question. As far as the           owner of the vehicle is concerned, when he hires a driver,           he has to check whether the driver has a valid driving           licence. Thereafter he has to satisfy himself as to the           competence of the driver. If satisfied in that regard also, it           can be said that the owner had taken reasonable care in           employing a person who is qualified and competent to           drive the vehicle. The owner cannot be expected to go           beyond that, to the extent of verifying the genuineness of           the driving licence with the licensing authority before           hiring the services of the driver. However, the situation           would be different if at the time of insurance of the vehicle           or thereafter the insurance company requires the owner           of the vehicle to have the licence duly verified from the           licensing authority or if the attention of the owner of the           vehicle is otherwise invited to the allegation that the           licence issued to the driver employed by him is a fake           one and yet the owner does not take appropriate action           for verification of the matter regarding the genuineness of           the licence from the licensing authority. That is what is           explained in Swaran Singh’s case (supra). If despite such           information with the owner that the licence possessed by           his driver is fake, no action is taken by the insured for           appropriate verification, then the insured will be at fault           and, in such circumstances, the insurance company is           not liable for the compensation.”    9.   While the insurer can certainly take the defence that the licence of  the driver of the car at the time of accident was invalid/fake however the                                                                              8  onus of proving that the insured did not take adequate care and caution to  verify the genuineness of the licence or was guilty of willful breach of the  conditions of the insurance policy or the contract of insurance lies on the  insurer.    10.   The view taken by the National Commission that the law as settled in  the Pepsu case (Supra) is not applicable in the present matter as it related  to third-party claim is erroneous. It has been categorically held in the case  of National Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Swaran Singh & Ors. 3 (SCC pp.341,  para 110) that,               “110. (iii)…Mere absence, fake or invalid driving licence             or disqualification of the driver for driving at the relevant             time, are not in themselves defences available to the             insurer against either the insured or the third parties.             To avoid its liability towards the insured, the insurer has             to prove that the insured was guilty of negligence and             failed to exercise reasonable care in the matter of fulfilling             the condition of the policy regarding use of vehicles by a             duly licenced driver or one who was not disqualified to             drive at the relevant time.”     3 (2004) 3 SCC 297 : 2004 SCC (Cri) 733                                                                             9  11.   While hiring a driver the employer is expected to verify if the driver  has a driving licence. If the driver produces a licence which on the face of  it looks genuine, the employer is not expected to further investigate into  the authenticity of the licence unless there is cause to believe otherwise. If  the employer finds the driver to be competent to drive the vehicle and has  satisfied himself that the driver has a driving licence there would be no  breach of Section 149(2)(a)(ii) and the Insurance Company would be liable  under the policy. It would be unreasonable to place such a high onus on  the insured to make enquiries with RTOs all over the country to ascertain  the veracity of the driving licence. However, if the Insurance Company is  able to prove that the owner/insured was aware or had notice that the  licence was fake or invalid and still permitted the person to drive, the  insurance company would no longer continue to be liable.    12.   On facts, in the instant case, the Appellant/Complainant had  employed the Driver, Dharmendra Singh as driver after checking his  driving licence. The driving licence was purported to have been issued by  the licencing authority, Sheikh Sarai, Delhi, however, the same could not  be verified as the concerned officer of the licencing authority deposed that  the record of the licence was not available with them. It is not the                                                                          10  contention   of   the      Respondent/   Insurance   Company      that   the  Appellant/complainant is guilty of willful negligence while employing the  driver. The driver had been driving competently and there was no reason  for the Appellant/Complainant to doubt the veracity of the driver’s licence.  In view of above facts and circumstances, the impugned judgment is not  liable to be sustained and is hereby set aside. The appeals accordingly  stand allowed. The respondent/ Insurance Company is held liable to  indemnify the appellant.                                                          ……………………… J.

Leave granted.             2.            The High Court by the impugned order dismissed two             appeals arising from separate orders of the Motor Accident Signature Not Verified             Claims Tribunal (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Tribunal’) deciding Digitally signed by SUSHMA KUMARI BAJAJ Date: 2020.06.18 16:50:13 IST Reason:                                                          1 two accident compensation claims. The appellants had claimed  further enhancement of compensation.   3.   The deceased in the first appeal was a housewife aged about  30 years. The second deceased was her daughter aged about 12  years. The claimants are the husband/father of the deceased and  three minor siblings. The two deceased on 25.12.2012 were  travelling in a horse cart along with some others to a religious  congregation. The horse cart was hit by a bus resulting in their  death.   The Tribunal assessed the notional income of the first  deceased at Rs.36,000/­ per annum and after 1/4 th deduction  towards personal expenses, with a multiplier of 17 awarded a  compensation of Rs.4,59,000/­. The Tribunal then deducted 50%  on ground of contributory negligence as the horse cart was stated  to have been in the middle of the road when the accident took  place. A sum of Rs.1,00,000/­ was then added as loss of  consortium and Rs.25,000/­ towards funeral expenses leading to  an award total of Rs.3,54,500/­ with interest at the rate of 7.5%.   4.   In so far as the minor child is concerned, the notional  income was assessed at Rs.36,000/­ per annum, applying a 50%                                     2 deduction towards personal expenses with a multiplier of 15, the  compensation was awarded at Rs.2,70,000/­ out of which 50%  was again deducted towards contributory negligence. A sum of  Rs.25,000/­ was added towards funeral expenses, leading to an  award total of Rs.1,60,000/­ with interest at the rate of 7.5%.   5.   The appeal for enhancement of compensation was dismissed  by the High Court and thus the present appeals.   6.   Learned counsel for the appellant submits that the notional  income of the first deceased has been wrongly fixed ignoring her  income of Rs.5000/­ per month from dairy farm business.  Nothing has been awarded towards future prospects.            With  regard to the second deceased it was submitted that she was  studying in a school and her notional income should have been  assessed at Rs.54,000/­ per year. Nothing has been awarded  towards loss of estate, loss of consortium and funeral expenses.  The common submission in both the appeals was that deduction  on ground of contributory negligence was unsustainable and  unjustified. Reliance was placed on Kajal vs. Jagdish Chand  & Ors., AIR 2020 SC 776, to contend that the income of the                                     3 deceased child should have been assessed at Rs.4846/­ per  month.   7.   Learned counsel for the respondents submitted that the  present appeals do not merit interference. There is no evidence  with regard to the claimed business income of the first deceased.  The finding of contributory negligence merits no interference. In  absence of any proof of income, the question of future prospects  simply does not arise.    Similarly, the second deceased was a  minor school going child who also had no income and therefore  the question for grant of future prospects with regard to her also  does not arise.   8.   We have considered the submission on behalf of the parties.  No evidence has been led by the appellant with regard to any  income of the first deceased from dairy business. The deceased  were travelling in a horse cart along with others to a religious  congregation. It is not the case of the respondents that the first  deceased was driving the horse cart or was the owner of the  same, much less that it was being driven under her supervision.  The deceased were travelling as passengers along with others.                                    4 The fact that the horse cart may have been in middle of the road  at the time of the accident, no fault can be attributed to the  deceased holding them liable to contributory negligence and  denial of full compensation. We fail to understand how the  deceased who were passengers in the horse cart can be held  liable in any manner. The deduction of 50% towards contributory  negligence in both the appeals is therefore held to be totally  unjustified and unsustainable. The finding with regard to  contributory negligence against both the deceased are therefore  set aside.   9.   The first deceased was a housewife aged about 30 years. In  Lata Wadhwa vs. State of Bihar, (2001) 8 SCC 197, this court  had observed that considering the multifarious services rendered  by housewives, even on a modest estimation, the income of a  housewife between the age group of 34 to 59 years who were  active in life should be assessed at Rs 36,000 per annum. A  distinction was also drawn with regard to elderly ladies in the age  group of 62 to 72 who would be more adept in discharge of  housewife duties by age and experience, and the value of services  rendered by them has been taken at Rs 20,000 per annum.                                    5 10.   In Arun Kumar Agrawal vs. National Insurance Co.  Ltd., (2010) 9 SCC 218, the Tribunal assessed the notional  income of the housewife at Rs.5,000/­ per month, but without  any rational or reasoning concluded that she was a non­earning  member and reduced the same to Rs.2,500/­, which was affirmed  by the High Court.    Disapproving the same and restoring the  assessed income, this Court observed at Paragraphs 26 and 27  as follows:          “26. In India the courts have recognised that the         contribution made by the wife to the house is         invaluable and cannot be computed in terms of         money. The gratuitous services rendered by the wife         with true love and affection to the children and her         husband and managing the household affairs         cannot be equated with the services rendered by         others. A wife/mother does not work by the clock.         She is in the constant attendance of the family         throughout the day and night unless she is         employed and is required to attend the employer’s         work for particular hours. She takes care of all the         requirements of the husband and children         including cooking of food, washing of clothes, etc.         She teaches small children and provides invaluable         guidance to them for their future life. A         housekeeper or maidservant can do the household         work, such as cooking food, washing clothes and         utensils, keeping the house clean, etc., but she can         never be a substitute for a wife/mother who         renders selfless service to her husband and         children.                                    6         27. It is not possible to quantify any amount in lieu         of the services rendered by the wife/mother to the         family i.e. the husband and children. However, for         the purpose of award of compensation to the         dependants, some pecuniary estimate has to be         made of the services of the housewife/mother. In         that context, the term “services” is required to be         given a broad meaning and must be construed by         taking into account the loss of personal care and         attention given by the deceased to her children as a         mother and to her husband as a wife. They are         entitled to adequate compensation in lieu of the         loss of gratuitous services rendered by the         deceased. The amount payable to the dependants         cannot be diminished on the ground that some         close relation like a grandmother may volunteer to         render some of the services to the family which the         deceased was giving earlier.”  11.   The notional income of the first deceased is therefore held to  be Rs.5000/­ per month at the time of death. The compensation  on that basis with a deduction of 1/4th i.e. Rs.15,000/­ towards  personal expenses with a multiplier of 17 is assessed at  Rs.7,65,000/­.   If   the   deceased   had   survived,   in   view   of  observations in Lata Wadhwa (supra), her skills as a matured  and skilled housewife in contributing to the welfare and care of  the family and in the upbringing of the children would have only  been enhanced by time and for which reason we hold that the  appellants shall be entitled to future prospects at the rate of 40%  in addition to the loss of consortium and future expenses already                                     7 granted. We therefore assess the total compensation payable to  the appellants in the first appeal at Rs.11,96,000/­.    12.    The second deceased was a school going child aged about  12 years. She had a whole future to look forward in life with all  normal human aspirations.          She died prematurely due to the  accident at a very tender age for no fault of hers even before she  could start to understand the beauty and joys of life with all its  ups and downs. The loss of a human life untimely at childhood  can never be measured in terms of loss of earning or monetary  loss alone. The emotional attachments involved to the loss of the  child can have a devastating effect on the family which needs to  be visualised and understood. Grant of non­pecuniary damages  for the wrong done by awarding compensation for loss of  expectation in life is therefore called for. Undoubtedly the injury  inflicted by deprivation of the life of the child is very difficult to  quantify. The future also abounds with uncertainties. Therefore,  the courts have used the expression “just compensation” to get  over   the   difficulties   in   quantifying   the   figure   to   ensure  consistency and uniformity in awarding compensation. This                                         8 determination shall not depend upon financial position of the  victim or the claimant but rather on the capacity and ability of  the deceased to provide happiness in life to the claimants had  she remained alive. The compensation is for loss of prospective  happiness which the claimant would have enjoyed had the child  not died at the tender age.   Since the child was studying in a  school and opportunities in life would undoubtedly abound for  her as the years would have rolled by, compensation must also  be granted with regard to future prospects.       It can safely be  presumed that education would have only led to her better  growth and maturity with better prospects and a bright future for  which compensation needs to be granted under non­pecuniary  damages. (See R.K. Malik vs. Kiran Pal, (2009) 14 SCC 1).    13.   The income of the minor girl child is incapable of precise  fixation. We find no reason to interfere with the assessed notional  income of the second deceased. In R.K. Malik vs. Kiran Pal,  (2009) 14 SCC 1, considering grant of future prospects for the  deceased child aged about 10 years it was observed as follows:          “32. A forceful submission has been made by the         learned counsel appearing for the appellant                                    9         claimants that both the Tribunal as well as the         High Court failed to consider the claims of the         appellants with regard to the future prospects of         the children. It has been submitted that the         evidence with regard to the same has been ignored         by the courts below.         33. On perusal of the evidence on record, we find         merit in such submission that the courts below         have overlooked that aspect of the matter while         granting compensation. It is well­settled legal         principle   that    in   addition     to   awarding         compensation for pecuniary losses, compensation         must also be granted with regard to the future         prospects of the children. It is incumbent upon the         courts to consider the said aspect while awarding         compensation…”   14. In New India Assurance Co. Ltd. vs. Satender, (2006) 13  SCC 60, the deceased victim of the accident was a nine year old  school going child. Considering the claim for loss of future  prospects in absence of a regular income, it was observed that  the compensation so determined had to be just and proper by a  judicious approach and not fixed arbitrarily or whimsically. The  uncertainties of a young life were noticed in the following terms:­          “12. In cases of young children of tender age, in         view of uncertainties abound, neither their income         at the time of death nor the prospects of the future         increase in their income nor chances of         advancement of their career are capable of proper         determination on estimated basis. The reason is         that at such an early age, the uncertainties in         regard to their academic pursuits, achievements in                                    10          career and thereafter advancement in life are so          many that nothing can be assumed with          reasonable certainty. Therefore, neither the income          of the deceased child is capable of assessment on          estimated basis nor the financial loss suffered by          the    parents   is   capable    of   mathematical          computation.”    15.   The deduction on account of contributory negligence has  already been held by us to be unsustainable. The determination  of a just and proper compensation to the appellants with regard  to the deceased child, in the entirety of the facts and  circumstances of the case does not persuade us to enhance the  same any further from Rs.2,95,000/­ by granting any further  compensation under the separate head of “future prospects”.      It  may only be noticed that R.K. Malik (supra) does not consider  Satender (supra) on the grant of future prospects as far as  children are concerned.    16.   Kajal (supra) is distinguishable on its own facts. The victim  of the accident was a nine month old child, whose disability  certificate reflected that she would grow up to be an adult lying  on the bed with all the physical and biological attributes of a                                    11 woman on attaining adulthood, but her mind would remain of a  nine month old child because of the accident.          The case is  completely distinguishable on its own facts and did not arise out  of a death claim, leading to award of compensation towards  expenses for frequent treatment, hospitalization, transportation,  loss of future earnings, attendant charges, pain, suffering, loss of  amenities, loss of marriage prospects and future medical  treatment etc.     17.

Noticing that there is a conflict between the decisions of the                           Bench of the two Judges of this Court in Om Prakash vs. Reliance                           General Insurance & Anr.1 and in the case of Oriental Insurance                           Co. Ltd. vs. Parvesh Chander Chadha2, on the question, as to                           whether delay in informing the occurrence of the theft of the                           vehicle to the insurance company, though the FIR was registered                           immediately, would disentitle the claimant of the insurance claim.                           The Bench of two Judges of this Court vide Order dated                           09.01.2018 has referred the matter to a three­Judge Bench. Signature Not Verified  Digitally signed by SANJAY KUMAR Date: 2020.01.24 16:38:15 IST Reason:                             1   Civil Appeal No.15611/ 2017 decided on 04.10.2017                          2   Civil Appeal No.6739/ 2010 decided on 17.08.2010; 2009 (1) CLT 552]                                            2   3.     The     appellant       had   got    his   tractor    insured     with   the  respondent(s) on 19.06.2010. On 28.10.2010, the tractor was  stolen and an FIR was lodged on the same day. However, the claim  was submitted to the respondent(s) on 15.12.2010.                          It was  rejected on the ground that intimation was given belatedly after 52  days. The appellant herein, therefore, approached the District  Consumer            Disputes   Redressal       Forum,       Jalandhar,    Punjab,  (hereinafter referred to as the “District Forum”) vide Complaint No.  380 of 2011. The District Forum, relying on the decisions of the  National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (hereinafter  referred to as the ‘National Commission’) in the case of Parvesh  Chander Chadha (supra) and T.D.P. Gram Sewa Sahakari Samiti  Ltd. & Ors. vs. Charanjit Kaur and Ors. 3., allowed the complaint  and directed the respondents to pay a sum of Rs.4,70,000/­ being  the declared insured value of the vehicle to the complainant within  one month from the date of receipt of copy of the order, failing  which, the respondents were made liable to pay interest at the  rate of 12% per annum from the date of order till payment.   4.     Being aggrieved thereby, the respondents preferred an  appeal       before      the    State      Consumer     Disputes         Redressal  3 2011(3) CPC 422                                   3   Commission, Punjab (hereinafter referred to as the “State  Commission”). The State Commission dismissed the appeal vide  order dated 26.03.2013.   5.      Being aggrieved by the dismissal of the appeal by the State  Commission, the respondents preferred a Revision Petition before  the National Commission. The National Commission relying on its  earlier judgment in the case of New India Assurance Co. Ltd. vs.  Trilochan Jane4 allowed the revision petition thereby setting aside  the orders of the District Forum as well as the State Commission  and dismissed the complaint. Being aggrieved thereby, the  appellant is before this Court.   6.      When the matter was heard by the two­Judge bench of this  Court, it noticed that though in the case of Om Prakash (supra),  the theft of the vehicle was reported to the police on the day after  the theft occurred, the intimation was sent to the insurance  company much later. This Court took the view that delay in  informing the insurance company would not debar the insured to  get the insurance claim. Per contra, it noticed that in the case of  Parvesh Chander Chadha (supra), this Court accepted the  contention of the insurance company that on account of delay in 4 (2012) CPJ 441 (NC)                                     4   intimating the insurance company about the theft, though the FIR  was lodged immediately, the insurance company was entitled to  repudiate the claim of the claimant. Hence, the present appeal.   7.    It will be relevant to refer to Condition No.1 of the Standard  Form for Commercial Vehicles Package Policy, which reads as  follows:        “1.     Notice shall be given in writing to the Company       immediately upon the occurrence of any accidental loss or       damage and in the event of any claim and thereafter the       insured shall give all such information and assistance as the       Company shall require. Every letter claim writ summons       and/or process or copy thereof shall be forwarded to the       Company immediately on receipt by the insured. Notice shall       also be given in writing to the company immediately the       insured shall have knowledge of any impending prosecution       inquest or fatal inquiry in respect of any occurrence which       may give rise to a claim under this policy. In case of theft or       criminal act which may be the subject of a claim under this       policy the insured shall give immediate notice to the police       and co­operate with the company in securing the conviction       of the offender.”   8.    The condition which falls for consideration in the present  case is identical with the condition that fell for consideration in  both the cases, namely, Om Prakash (supra) and Parvesh Chander  Chadha (supra). In the case of Parvesh Chander Chadha (supra),  the vehicle was stolen between 18.01.1995 and 20.01.1995. The  FIR for the alleged theft of car was registered on 20.01.1995.  However, the intimation was given to the insurer on 22.05.1995.                                  5   On account of the delay, the claim for compensation was  repudiated by the insurance company for breach of policy. In the  said case, the District Forum had allowed the complaint of the  claimant, which order was maintained by the State Commission  as well as the National Commission. However, reversing the  concurrent orders, this Court held that though the theft had  occurred between 18.01.1995 and 20.01.1995, the intimation to  the insurance company was given only on 22.05.1995. It observed  that no explanation for such an unusual delay in informing the  insurer was given by the claimant. This Court found that in terms  of the policy issued by the insurer (appellant therein), the  respondent was duty bound to inform it about the theft of the  vehicle immediately after the incident. It further observed, that on  account of delay in intimation, the insurer was deprived of its  legitimate right to get an inquiry conducted into the alleged theft  of the vehicle and make an endeavour to recover the same.   9.   Per contra, in the case of Om Prakash (supra), the vehicle  was stolen on 23.03.2010 at around 9.00 p.m. The claimant  lodged an FIR immediately on 24.03.2010. He lodged the  insurance claim on 31.03.2010. Since the claim of the claimant  was repudiated, he filed complaint before the District Forum                                   6   which was allowed. The State Commission also maintained the  order of the District Forum. However, in the revision, the National  Commission reversed the same. In an appeal, this Court found  that the claimant (the appellant therein) had assigned cogent  reasons for the delay of 8 days in lodging the complaint. It further  found that the word “immediately”’ cannot be construed narrowly  so as to deprive claimant the benefit of the settlement of genuine  claim, particularly when the delay was explained. It further held,  that rejection of the claim on purely technical grounds and in a  mechanical manner will result in loss of confidence of policy  holders in the insurance industry. It further held, that if the  reasons for delay in making a claim is satisfactorily explained,  such a claim cannot be rejected on the ground of delay. This Court  also held that it would not be fair and reasonable to reject the  genuine claims which have already been verified and found to be  correct by the investigator. It further held, that the condition  regarding the delay shall not be a shelter to repudiate the  insurance claims which have been otherwise proved to be genuine.  This Court observed that the Consumer Protection Act aims at  providing better protection of the interest of the consumers. It is a  beneficial legislation that deserves a liberal construction.                                      7    10.    We are of the view that much would depend upon the words  ‘co­operate’ and ‘immediate’, in condition No. 1 of the Standard  Form for Commercial Vehicles Package Policy. Before we analyze  this   case   any    further,   we   need   to   observe    the    rules    of  interpretation applicable to a contract of insurance. Generally, an  insurance contract is governed by the rules of interpretation  applicable    to    the   general contracts.     However,    due    to     the  specialized nature of contract of insurance, certain rules are  tailored to suit insurance contracts. Under the English law, the  development of insurance jurisprudence is given credence to Lord  Mansfield, who developed the law from its infancy. Without going  much into the development of the interpretation rules, we may  allude to Justice Neuberger in Arnold v. Britton5,                 which is  simplified as under:         (1) reliance placed in some cases on commercial        common sense and surrounding circumstances        was not to be invoked to undervalue the        importance of the language of the provision        which is to be construed.         (2) the less clear the words used were, the more        ready the court could properly be to depart from        their natural meaning, but that did not justify        departing from the natural meaning.    5 [2015]   UKSC 36                                   8         (3) commercial common sense was not to be       invoked retrospectively, so that the mere fact that       a contractual arrangement has worked out badly,       or even disastrously, for one of the parties was       not a reason for departing from the natural       language.        (4) a court should be very slow to reject the       natural meaning of a provision as correct simply       because it appeared to be a very imprudent term       for one of the parties to have agreed.        (5) when interpreting a contractual provision, the       court could only take into account facts or       circumstances which existed at the time that the       contract was made and which were known or       reasonably available to both parties.         (6) if an event subsequently occurred which was       plainly not intended or contemplated by the       parties, if it was clear what the parties would       have intended, the court would give effect to that       intention.6  11.   A perusal of the aforesaid shows that this contract is to be  interpreted according to the context involved in the contract. The  contract we are interpreting is a Commercial Vehicle Package  Policy. There is no gainsaying that in a contract, the bargaining  power is usually at equal footing. In this regard, the joint intention  of the parties is taken into consideration for interpretation of a  contract. However, in most standard form contracts, that is not  so. In this regard, the Court in such circumstances would   6Robert Merkin QC et el., Colinvaux’s Law of Insurance (11th Eds.), p. 159.                                   9   consider the application of the rule of contra preferatum, when  ambiguity exists and an interpretation of the contract is preferred  which favors the party with lesser bargaining power.    12.   It is argued on behalf of the respondents and rightly so, that  the insurance policy is a contract between the insurer and the  insured and the parties would be strictly bound by the terms and  conditions as provided in the contract between the parties.   13.   In our view, applying the aforesaid principles, Condition No.  1 of the Standard Form for Commercial Vehicles Package Policy  will have to be divided into two parts. The perusal of the first part  of Condition No. 1 would reveal, that it provides that ‘a notice  shall be given in writing to the company immediately upon the  occurrence of any accidental loss or damage’. It further provides,  that in the event of any claim and thereafter, the insured shall  give all such information and assistance as the company shall  require. It provides, that every letter claim writ summons and/or  process or copy thereof shall be forwarded to the insurance  company immediately on receipt by the insured.            It further  provides, that a notice shall also be given in writing to the  company immediately by the insured if he shall have knowledge of                                  10   any impending prosecution inquest or fatal inquiry in respect of  any occurrence, which may give rise to a claim under this policy.   14.   A perusal of the wordings used in this part would reveal,  that all the things which are required to be done under this part  are related to an occurrence of an accident. On occurrence of an  accidental loss, the insured is required to immediately give a  notice in writing to the company. This appears to be so that the  company can assign a surveyor so as to assess the damages  suffered by the insured/vehicle. It further provides, that any letter  claim writ summons and/or process or copy thereof shall be  forwarded to the company immediately on receipt by the insured.  As such, the intention would be clear. The question of receipt of  letter claim writ summons and/or process or copy thereof by the  insured, would only arise in the event of the criminal proceedings  being initiated with regard to the occurrence of the accident. It  further provides, that the insured shall also give a notice in  writing to the company immediately if the insured shall have the  knowledge of any impending prosecution inquest or fatal inquiry  in respect of any occurrence which may give rise to a claim under  this policy. It will again make the intention clear that the                                   11   immediate action is contemplated in respect of an accident  occurring to the vehicle.   15.   We find, that the second part of Condition No. 1 deals with  the ‘theft or criminal act other than the accident’. It provides, that  in case of theft or criminal act which may be the subject of a claim  under the policy, the insured shall give immediate notice to the  police and co­operate with the company in securing the conviction  of the offender. The object behind giving immediate notice to the  police appears to be that if the police is immediately informed  about the theft or any criminal act, the police machinery can be  set in motion and steps for recovery of the vehicle could be  expedited. In a case of theft, the insurance company or a surveyor  would have a limited role. It is the police, who acting on the FIR of  the insured, will be required to take immediate steps for tracing  and recovering the vehicle.       Per contra, the surveyor of the  insurance company, at the most, could ascertain the factum  regarding the theft of the vehicle.   16.   It is further to be noted that, in the event, after the  registration of an FIR, the police successfully recovering the  vehicle and returning the same to the insured, there would be no                                   12   occasion to lodge a claim for compensation on account of the  policy. It is only when the police are not in a position to trace and  recover the vehicle and the final report is lodged by the police after  the vehicle is not traced, the insured would be in a position to  lodge his claim for compensation. As observed by the bench of two  learned Judges in the case of Om Prakash (supra), after the vehicle  is stolen, a person, who lost his vehicle, would immediately lodge  an FIR and the immediate conduct that would be expected of such  a person would be to assist the police in search of the vehicle. The  registration of the FIR regarding the theft of the vehicle and the  final report of the police after the vehicle is not traced would  substantiate the claim of the claimant that the vehicle is stolen.  Not only that, but the surveyors appointed by the insurance  company are also required to enquire whether the claim of the  claimant regarding the theft is genuine or not. If the surveyor  appointed by the insurance company, upon inquiry, finds that the  claim of theft is genuine then coupled with the immediate  registration of the FIR, in our view, would be conclusive proof of  the vehicle being stolen.   17.   That the term ‘co­operate’ as used under the contract needs  to be assessed in facts and circumstances. While assessing the                                  13   ‘duty to co­operate’ for the insured, inter alia the Court should  have regards to those breaches by the insured which are  prejudicial to the insurance company. Usually, mere delay in  informing the theft to the insurer, when the same was already  informed to the law enforcement authorities, cannot amount to a  breach of ‘duty to co­operate’ of the insured.   18.   We concur with the view taken in the case of Om Prakash  (supra), that in such a situation if the claimant is denied the claim  merely on the ground that there is some delay in intimating the  insurance company about the occurrence of the theft, it would be  taking a hyper technical view.    We find, that this Court in Om  Prakash (supra) has rightly held that it would not be fair and  reasonable to reject genuine claims which had already been  verified and found to be correct by the investigator.   19.   We find, that this Court in Om Prakash (supra) has rightly  held that the Consumer Protection Act aims at protecting the  interest of the consumers and it being a beneficial legislation  deserves pragmatic construction. We find, that in Om Prakash  (supra) this Court has rightly held that mere delay in intimating  the insurance company about the theft of the vehicle should not                                     14   be a shelter to repudiate the insurance claim which has been  otherwise proved to be genuine.    20.    We, therefore, hold that when an insured has lodged the FIR  immediately after the theft of a vehicle occurred and when the  police after investigation have lodged a final report after the  vehicle was not traced and when the surveyors/investigators  appointed by the insurance company have found the claim of the  theft to be genuine, then mere delay in intimating the insurance  company about the occurrence of the theft cannot be a ground to  deny the claim of the insured.    21.    We, therefore, answer the reference accordingly.   22.    In the present case, the facts are undisputed. The theft had  occurred on 28.10.2010. The FIR was lodged at P.S. Nakodar,  Jalandhar, Punjab on the same day i.e. 28.10.2010. The police  have    admittedly   lodged   the   final   report.   The   investigators  appointed by the insurance company have submitted their  investigation report on 25.02.2011, finding the claim of the  appellant to be genuine. In this background, the National  Commission was not justified in reversing the concurrent orders of                                    15   the District Forum and the State Commission. The appeal is,  therefore, allowed. The impugned Judgment and order dated  17.03.2015 passed by the National Commission is quashed and  set aside. The order of the District Forum dated 09.05.2012 as  maintained by the State Commission vide order dated 26.03.2013  is maintained.   23.   The amount, i.e., 75% of the claim amount deposited by the  respondents,     pursuant to    the orders of this Court dated  09.01.2018, in this Registry shall be permitted to be withdrawn by  the appellant herein along with interest accrued thereon.                 The  remainder shall be paid by the respondents within a period of six  weeks from today along with interest at the rate of 12% per  annum on the entire amount of Rs.4,70,000/­ from the date of the  order of the District Forum till its realisation.                                                 …………...................J.

Leave granted.            2.              The appellant is aggrieved by indefinite order of blacklisting           dated 08.09.2009. The High Court dismissed the writ petition in           limine, only on the ground of delay, as having been preferred ten           years later.           3.              Ms. Shobha Gupta, learned counsel for the appellant,           submits that it holds a valid licence under the Drugs and           Cosmetics Act, 1940 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Drugs Act’) in           Form 28 (Rule 76) issued by the Drugs Control Administration, Signature Not Verified           Government of Andhra Pradesh. Digitally signed by ASHA SUNDRIYAL                                                          M/s Palak Pharmaceuticals Date: 2020.11.06 14:55:06 IST Reason:            Private Limited had obtained supplies from the appellant in the                                                       1 year 2007, and in turn had supplied it to the respondent under a  tender notice dated 04.10.2006. The label ‘XYO701’ on the  injection was an inadvertent human error. The brand name of  the medicine was correctly mentioned as “OXY­125”. The  composition of the medicine was also correctly mentioned as  “Oxytetracycline IP Vet 125 mg”. The generic word “Hcl” was only  missing on the label, and it was written as “OXYTETRACYCLINE  INJ. I.P. VET” in place of “OXYTETRACYCLINE HCL INJ. I.P.  VET”.   It was therefore a case of bonafide inadvertent printing  error which resulted in misbranding. The product was not  substandard or spurious veterinary medicine.   4.   The appellant was served with an order of blacklisting dated  08.09.2009 by    the   Office   of   Director,   Animal   Husbandry  Department of the respondent referring to the State Analyst  report dated 10.10.2008, declaring the batch supplied by the  appellant to be of substandard quality (misbranded/not in  accordance with Oxytetracycline injection), thus violating clauses  8.12 and 8.23 of the Tender of 2006­07. The appellant informed  the respondents that it had never made any supplies to them  under the Tender in question. The misbranding referred to was                                     2 an inadvertent error. The respondents required certain further  clarifications which were furnished on 04.05.2019 but to no  outcome. The order of blacklisting is causing great prejudice to  the appellant preventing it from participating in similar tenders,  the most recent being the rejection by the Government of  Rajasthan dated 05.07.2019 for the said reason. No proceedings  were taken out by the respondents against the appellant under  Sections 23, 25, 26 and 27 of the Drugs Act.  5.   The explanation furnished for the delay in the writ petition  has not been considered properly. The order of blacklisting being  in violation of the principles of natural justice, delay is irrelevant  and the cause of action continues because of its indefinite nature  and consequences. Learned counsel has relied heavily on  Gorkha Security Services vs. Government (NCT of Delhi) &  Ors., (2014) 9 SCC 105, to submit that the show cause notice  dated 21.10.2008 did not meet the requirement of the law. She  has further relied upon M/s Daffodills Pharmaceuticals Ltd. &  Anr. vs. State of U.P. & Anr., 2019 (17) SCALE 758, where this  Court opined that a debarment of approximately four years was  sufficient.                                     3 6.   Shri Ankit Goel, learned counsel for the respondents,  submits that the writ petition was rightly dismissed on grounds  of gross and inordinate delay of ten years in challenging the order  of blacklisting. It was preceded by a show cause notice dated  21.10.2008, and consideration of the reply submitted.           The  veterinary medicine was misbranded in terms of Section 9 of the  Drugs Act, duly supported by the report of the analyst.         Any  latent defect in the show cause notice has not caused any  prejudice to the appellant. The impugned orders therefore merit  no interference.  7.   We have considered the submissions on behalf of the parties  and are satisfied that the writ petition deserves to be allowed for  more than one reason.  8.   The appellant is a licensed drug manufacturer. The drugs  in question have been found to be misbranded and not spurious  or adulterated. The appellant took the plea of a bonafide  inadvertent   printing   error    on    the   label,   by   stating  “OXYTETRACYCLINE         INJ.    I.P.    VET”     in    place    of  “OXYTETRACYCLINE HCL INJ. I.P. VET”.          This explanation by  the appellant dated 15.11.2008 in reply to the show cause notice                                     4 finds no consideration by the respondents at any stage.             The  appellant initially sought to purse matters with the respondents.  On 19.05.2011, the appellant requested the respondents for  allowing it to participate in further tenders for 2011­2012. The  matter was also subsequently followed up by the appellants in  writing with the respondents. On 01.05.2019, the appellant again  requested     to   withdraw   the   order    dated   08.09.2009.    The  respondents on 03.05.2019 rejected the request of the appellant  reiterating violation of clauses 8.12 and 8.23 of the Tender of  2006­07. It however sought certain additional information to  consider the representation of the appellant which was submitted  on   04.05.2019.       The    appellant     was   also   debarred   from  consideration by the State of Rajasthan on 05.07.2019 by reason  of the impugned order of blacklisting. In absence of any response  thereafter from the respondents, the writ petition came to be  instituted.    9.   There is no dispute that the injection was not supplied to  the respondents by the appellant.         Yet the show cause notice  dated 21.10.2008 referred to further action in terms of the  Tender for supplying misbranded medicine to the appellant.                                      5 Furthermore, the show cause notice did not state that action by  blacklisting was to be taken, or was under contemplation. It only  mentioned appropriate action in accordance with the rules of the  Tender.    The fact that the terms of the tender may have provided  for blacklisting is irrelevant in the facts of the case. In absence of  any supply by the appellant, the order of blacklisting dated  08.09.2009 invoking clauses 8.12 and 8.23 of the Tender is a  fundamental flaw, vitiating the impugned order on the face of it  reflecting non application of mind to the issues involved. Even  after the appellant brought this fact to the attention of the  respondents, they refused to pay any heed to it.          Further, it  specifies no duration for the same.   10.   M/s. Erusian Equipment & Chemicals Ltd. vs. State of  West Bengal and another, (1975) 1 SCC 70, held that there  could not be arbitrary blacklisting and that too in violation of the  principles of natural justice. In Joseph Vilangandan vs. The  Executive Engineer, (PWD), Ernakulam and others, (1978) 3  SCC 36, this Court was considering a show cause notice as  follows:                                       6       “17. ….“You are therefore requested to show       cause ... why the work may not be arranged       otherwise at your risk and loss, through other       agencies after debarring you as a defaulter....”       The crucial words are those that have been       underlined (herein in italics). They take their colour       from the context. Construed along with the links of       the sentence which precede and succeed them, the       words “debarring you as a defaulter”, could be       understood as conveying no more than that an action       with reference to the contract in question, only, was       under contemplation. There are no words in the       notice which could give a clear intimation to the       addressee that it was proposed to debar him from       taking any contract, whatever, in future under the       Department.…”   11.   The question whether a show cause notice prior to  blacklisting mandates express communication why blacklisting  be not ordered or was in contemplation of the authorities, this  Court in Gorkha Security Services (supra) held as follows:­         “27. We are, therefore, of the opinion that it was       incumbent on the part of the Department to state in       the show­cause notice that the competent authority       intended to impose such a penalty of blacklisting, so       as to provide adequate and meaningful opportunity       to the appellant to show cause against the same.       However, we may also add that even if it is not       mentioned specifically but from the reading of the       show­cause notice, it can be clearly inferred that       such an action was proposed, that would fulfil this       requirement. In the present case, however, reading of       the show­cause notice does not suggest that noticee       could find out that such an action could also be                                    7 taken. We say so for the reasons that are recorded hereinafter.  28. In the instant case, no doubt the show­cause notice dated 6­2­2013 was served upon the appellant. Relevant portion thereof has already been extracted above (see para 5). This show­cause notice is conspicuously silent about the blacklisting action. On the contrary, after stating in detail the nature of alleged defaults and breaches of the agreement committed by the appellant the notice specifically mentions that because of the said defaults the appellant was “as such liable to be levied the cost accordingly”. It further says “why the action as mentioned above may not be taken against the firm, besides other action as deemed fit by the competent authority”. It follows from the above that main action which the respondents wanted to take was to levy the cost. No doubt, the notice further mentions that the competent authority could take other actions as deemed fit. However, that may not fulfil the requirement of putting the defaulter to the notice that action of blacklisting was also in the mind of the competent authority. Mere existence of Clause 27 in the agreement entered into between the parties, would not suffice the aforesaid mandatory requirement by vaguely mentioning other “actions as deemed fit”. As already pointed out above insofar as penalty of blacklisting and forfeiture of earnest money/security deposit is concerned it can be imposed only, “if so warranted”. Therefore, without any specific stipulation in this behalf, the respondent could not have imposed the penalty of blacklisting.                          xxxxxxx 33. When we apply the ratio of the aforesaid judgment to the facts of the present case, it becomes difficult to accept the argument of the learned Additional Solicitor General. In the first instance, we may point out that no such case was set up by the respondents that by omitting to state the proposed action of blacklisting the appellant in the show­cause                            8       notice, has not caused any prejudice to the appellant.       Moreover, had the action of blacklisting being       specifically proposed in the show­cause notice, the       appellant could have mentioned as to why such       extreme penalty is not justified. It could have come       out with extenuating circumstances defending such       an action even if the defaults were there and the       Department was not satisfied with the explanation       qua the defaults. It could have even pleaded with the       Department not to blacklist the appellant or do it for       a lesser period in case the Department still wanted to       blacklist the appellant. Therefore, it is not at all       acceptable     that   non­mentioning    of   proposed       blacklisting in the show­cause notice has not caused       any prejudice to the appellant. This apart, the       extreme nature of such a harsh penalty like       blacklisting with severe consequences, would itself       amount to causing prejudice to the appellant.”  12.   If the respondents had expressed their mind in the show  cause notice to blacklist, the appellant could have filed an  appropriate response to the same. The insistence of the  respondents to support the impugned order by reference to the  terms of the tender cannot cure the illegality in absence of the  appellant being a successful tenderer and supplier. We therefore  hold that the order of blacklisting dated 08.09.2009 stands  vitiated from the very inception on more than one ground and  merits interference.  13.   In view of the aforesaid conclusion, there may have been no  need to go into the question of the duration of the blacklisting,                                   9 but for the arguments addressed before us. An order of  blacklisting operates to the prejudice of a commercial person not  only in praesenti but also puts a taint which attaches far beyond  and may well spell the death knell of the organisation/institution  for all times to come described as a civil death.              The  repercussions on the appellant were clearly spelt out by it in the  representations as also in the writ petition, including the  consequences under the Rajasthan tender, where it stood  debarred expressly because of the present impugned order. The  possibility always remains that if a proper show cause notice had  been given and the reply furnished would have been considered  in accordance with law, even if the respondents decided to  blacklist the appellant, entirely different considerations may have  prevailed in their minds especially with regard to the duration.  This court in Kulja Industries Limited vs. Chief General  Manager, Western Telecom Project Bharat Sanchar Nigam  Limited and others, (2014) 14 SCC 731, despite declining to  interfere with an order of blacklisting, but noticing that an order  of permanent debarment was unjustified, observed: ­        “28.2. Secondly, because while determining the       period for which the blacklisting should be effective                                  10       the respondent Corporation may for the sake of       objectivity and transparency formulate broad       guidelines to be followed in such cases. Different       periods of debarment depending upon the gravity of       the offences, violations and breaches may be       prescribed by such guidelines. While it may not be       possible to exhaustively enumerate all types of       offences and acts of misdemeanour, or violations of       contractual obligations by a contractor, the       respondent Corporation may do so as far as possible       to reduce if not totally eliminate arbitrariness in the       exercise of the power vested in it and inspire       confidence in the fairness of the order which the       competent authority may pass against a defaulting       contractor.”        Since the order of blacklisting has been found to be  unsustainable by us, and considering the long passage of time,  we are not inclined to remand the matter to the authorities. In  M/s Daffodills Pharmaceuticals (supra), relied upon by the  appellant, this court has observed that an order of blacklisting  beyond 3 years or maximum of 5 years was disproportionate.  14.   That brings us to the question of delay. There is no doubt  that the High Court in its discretionary jurisdiction may decline  to exercise the discretionary writ jurisdiction on ground of delay  in approaching the court. But it is only a rule of discretion by  exercise of self­restraint evolved by the court in exercise of the  discretionary   equitable   jurisdiction   and   not   a   mandatory                                     11 requirement that every delayed petition must be dismissed on the  ground of delay.    The Limitation Act stricto sensu does not apply  to the writ jurisdiction. The discretion vested in the court under  Article 226 of the Constitution therefore has to be a judicious  exercise of the discretion after considering all pros and cons of  the matter, including the nature of the dispute, the explanation  for the delay, whether any third­party rights have intervened etc.  The jurisdiction under Article 226 being equitable in nature,  questions of proportionality in considering whether the impugned  order merits interference or not in exercise of the discretionary  jurisdiction will also arise.    This Court in Basanti Prasad vs.  Bihar School Examination Board and others, (2009) 6 SCC  791, after referring to Moon Mills Ltd. vs. Industrial Court, AIR  1967 SC 1450, Maharashtra SRTC vs. Balwant Regular  Motor Service, AIR 1969 SC 329 and State of M.P. and Others  vs. Nandlal Jaiswal and others, (1986) 4 SCC 566, held that if  the delay is properly explained and no third party rights are  being   affected,   the   writ   court   under   Article   226   of   the  Constitution may condone the delay, holding as follows:                                        12       “18. In the normal course, we would not have taken       exception to the order passed by the High Court.       They are justified in saying that a delinquent       employee should not be permitted to revive the stale       claim and the High Court in exercise of its discretion       would not ordinarily assist the tardy and indolent       person. This is the traditional view and is well       supported by a plethora of decisions of this Court.       This Court also has taken the view that there is no       inviolable rule, that, whenever there is delay the       Court must refuse to entertain a petition. This Court       has stated that the writ court in exercise of its       extraordinary jurisdiction under Article 226 of the       Constitution may condone the delay in filing the       petition, if the delay is satisfactorily explained.”  15.   The contention of the respondents that they have acted in  accordance with the provisions of the Drugs Act pursuant to the  report of the analyst for misbranded product under Section 9 is  devoid of substance and merits no consideration. It is not the  case of the respondents that the procedure prescribed under  Sections 23, 25 and 26 of the Drug Act has been followed. The  feeble attempt to show compliance with provisions of the Drugs  Act by alleged purchase of the samples under Form 14A at  Annexure R­5 to the counter affidavit dated 21.07.2008 from an  unknown source and date must be rejected outright as an  attempt to create evidence where none exists.                                    13 16.   The aforesaid discussion, therefore, leads us to the  conclusion that the writ petition was not barred by unexplained  delay as the appellant had been pursuing the matter with the  authorities and it is they who sat over it, triggering rejection of  appellants tender by the Rajasthan Government on 05.07.2019  leading to the institution of the writ petition on 24.07.2019. The  High Court therefore erred in dismissing the writ petition on  grounds of delay. The illegality and the disproportionate nature  of the order dated 08.09.2009, with no third party rights affected,  never engaged the attention of the High Court in judicious  exercise   of    the    discretionary    equitable     jurisdiction.

Nariman, J.                        1. We have heard Shri K.K. Venugopal, learned Attorney General for                           India, Ms. Madhvi Divan, learned Addl. Solicitor General of India, Shri                           Siddhartha Dave, learned Senior Advocate (appointed as Amicus                           Curiae, vide Order dated 16.7.2020), Ms. Nitya Ramakrishnan,                           learned counsel appearing on behalf of the intervenor and the learned                           counsel appearing on behalf of the respective States and Union                           Territories.                        2. This Court, vide Order dated 03.04.2018 in SLP (Crl) No. 2302 of                           2017, reported as Shafhi Mohammad v. State of Himachal                           Pradesh (2018) 5 SCC 311, directed that a Central Oversight Body Signature Not Verified  Digitally signed by                          (hereinafter referred to as the “COB”) be set up by the Ministry of Nidhi Ahuja Date: 2020.12.02 17:26:18 IST Reason:                           Home Affairs to implement the plan of action with respect to the use                           of videography in the crime scene during the investigation. This Court,                                                                                                      1   while considering the directions issued in D.K. Basu Vs. State of    West Bengal & Others (2015) 8 SCC 744, held that there was a need    for further directions that in every State an oversight mechanism be    created whereby an independent committee can study the CCTV    camera footages and periodically publish a report of its observations    thereon. The COB was further directed to issue appropriate    instructions in this regard at the earliest.  3. This Court further directed that the COB may issue appropriate    directions from time to time so as to ensure that use of videography    becomes a reality in a phased manner, the first phase of which be    implemented by 15.07.2018. The crime scene videography ought to    be introduced at least at some places as per viability and priority    determined by the COB.  4. Pursuant to the aforesaid directions a COB was constituted by the    Ministry of Home Affairs on 09.05.2018 (as per the Affidavit dated    26.07.2018) to oversee the implementation of the use of photography    and videography in the crime scene by the State / Union Territory    Government and other Central Agencies, to suggest the possibility of    setting up a Central Server for implementation of videography, and to    issue appropriate directions so as to ensure that use of videography    becomes a reality in a phased manner. Accordingly, directions were    issued to the Administrators of the Union Territory, State                                                                              2   Governments      and    other   Central    Agencies    for   effective    implementation of the use of photography and videography at the    crime scenes, and to furnish an Action Taken Report on the    implementation of the use of videography in the crime scene.  5. This Court, vide Order dated 16.07.2020, issued notice in the instant    Special Leave Petition to the Ministry of Home Affairs on the question    of audio-video recordings of Section 161 CrPC statements as is    provided by Section 161 (3) proviso, as well as the larger question as    to installation of CCTV cameras in police stations generally. While    issuing notice this Court also took note of the directions in Shafhi    Mohammad (supra).  6. This Court, vide Order dated 16.09.2020, impleaded all the States    and Union Territories to find out the exact position of CCTV cameras    qua each Police Station as well as the constitution of Oversight    Committees in accordance with the Order dated 03.04.2018 of this    Court in Shafhi Mohammad (supra).  7. Pursuant to the said directions of this Court, Compliance Affidavits    and Action Taken Reports were filed by 14 States (till 24.11.2020),    namely, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Nagaland,    Karnataka, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, Assam, Sikkim, Mizoram, Madhya    Pradesh, Meghalaya, Manipur; and 2 Union Territories, namely,    Andaman & Nicobar Islands and Puducherry.                                                                               3 8. The majority of the Compliance Affidavits and Action Taken Reports     fail to disclose the exact position of CCTV cameras qua each Police     Station. The affidavits are bereft of details with respect to the total     number of Police Stations functioning in the respective State and     Union Territory; total number of CCTV cameras installed in each and     every Police Station; the positioning of the CCTV cameras already     installed; working condition of the CCTV cameras; whether the CCTV     cameras have a recording facility, if yes, then for how many     days/hours, have not been disclosed. Further, the position qua     constitution of Oversight Committees in accordance with the Order     dated 03.04.2018, and/or details with respect to the Oversight     Committees already constituted in the respective States and Union     Territory have also not been disclosed.  9. Compliance affidavits by all the States and Union Territories are to be     filed, as has been stated earlier, by either the Principal Secretary of     the State or the Secretary, Home Department of the States/Union     Territories. This is to be done by all the States and Union Territories,     including those who have filed so-called compliance affidavits till date,     stating the details mentioned in paragraph 8 of this Order. These     affidavits are to be filed within a period of six weeks from today.  10. So far as constitution of Oversight Committees in accordance with     our Order dated 03.04.2018 is concerned, this should be done at the                                                                                   4    State and District levels. The State Level Oversight Committee     (hereinafter referred to as the “SLOC”) must consist of:     (i) The Secretary/Additional Secretary, Home Department;     (ii) Secretary/Additional Secretary, Finance Department;     (iii) The Director General/Inspector General of Police; and     (iv) The Chairperson/member of the State Women’s Commission.  11. So far as the District Level Oversight Committee (hereinafter referred     to as “DLOC”) is concerned, this should comprise of:     (i) The Divisional Commissioner/ Commissioner of Divisions/     Regional Commissioner/ Revenue Commissioner Division of the     District (by whatever name called);     (ii) The District Magistrate of the District;     (iii) A Superintendent of Police of that District; and     (iv) A mayor of a municipality within the District/ a Head of the Zilla     Panchayat in rural areas.  12. It shall be the duty of the SLOC to see that the directions passed by     this Court are carried out. Amongst others, the duties shall consist of:     a) Purchase, distribution and installation of CCTVs and its equipment;     b) Obtaining the budgetary allocation for the same;     c) Continuous monitoring of maintenance and upkeep of CCTVs and     its equipment;     d) Carrying out inspections and addressing the grievances received                                                                                  5    from the DLOC; and     e) To call for monthly reports from the DLOC and immediately address     any concerns like faulty equipment.  Likewise, the DLOC shall have the following obligations:     a) Supervision, maintenance and upkeep of CCTVs and its     equipment;     b) Continuous monitoring of maintenance and upkeep of CCTVs and     its equipment;     c) To interact with the Station House Officer (hereinafter referred to     as the “SHO”) as to the functioning and maintenance of CCTVs and     its equipment; and     d) To send monthly reports to the SLOC about the functioning of     CCTVs and allied equipment.     e) To review footage stored from CCTVs in the various Police Stations     to check for any human rights violation that may have occurred but     are not reported.  13. It is obvious that none of this can be done without allocation of     adequate funds for the same, which must be done by the     States’/Union Territories’ Finance Departments at the very earliest.  14. The duty and responsibility for the working, maintenance and     recording of CCTVs shall be that of the SHO of the police station     concerned. It shall be the duty and obligation of the SHO to                                                                                6    immediately report to the DLOC any fault with the equipment or     malfunctioning of CCTVs. If the CCTVs are not functioning in a     particular police station, the concerned SHO shall inform the DLOC     of the arrest / interrogations carried out in that police station during     the said period and forward the said record to the DLOC. If the     concerned SHO has reported malfunctioning or non-functioning of     CCTVs of a particular Police Station, the DLOC shall immediately     request the SLOC for repair and purchase of the equipment, which     shall be done immediately.  15. The Director General/Inspector General of Police of each State and     Union Territory should issue directions to the person in charge of a     Police Station to entrust the SHO of the concerned Police Station with     the responsibility of assessing the working condition of the CCTV     cameras installed in the police station and also to take corrective     action to restore the functioning of all non-functional CCTV cameras.     The SHO should also be made responsible for CCTV data     maintenance, backup of data, fault rectification etc.  16. The State and Union Territory Governments should ensure that CCTV     cameras are installed in each and every Police Station functioning in     the respective State and/or Union Territory. Further, in order to ensure     that no part of a Police Station is left uncovered, it is imperative to     ensure that CCTV cameras are installed at all entry and exit points;                                                                                  7    main gate of the police station; all lock-ups; all corridors; lobby/the     reception area; all verandas/outhouses, Inspector's room; Sub-     Inspector's room; areas outside the lock-up room; station hall; in front     of     the   police   station   compound;      outside     (not   inside)     washrooms/toilets; Duty Officer’s room; back part of the police station     etc.  17. CCTV systems that have to be installed must be equipped with night     vision and must necessarily consist of audio as well as video footage.     In areas in which there is either no electricity and/or internet, it shall     be the duty of the States/Union Territories to provide the same as     expeditiously as possible using any mode of providing electricity,     including solar/wind power. The internet systems that are provided     must also be systems which provide clear image resolutions and     audio. Most important of all is the storage of CCTV camera footage     which can be done in digital video recorders and/or network video     recorders. CCTV cameras must then be installed with such recording     systems so that the data that is stored thereon shall be preserved for     a period of 18 months. If the recording equipment, available in the     market today, does not have the capacity to keep the recording for 18     months but for a lesser period of time, it shall be mandatory for all     States, Union Territories and the Central Government to purchase     one which allows storage for the maximum period possible, and, in                                                                                    8    any case, not below 1 year. It is also made clear that this will be     reviewed by all the States so as to purchase equipment which is able     to store the data for 18 months as soon as it is commercially available     in the market. The affidavit of compliance to be filed by all States and     Union Territories and Central Government shall clearly indicate that     the best equipment available as of date has been purchased.  18. Whenever there is information of force being used at police stations     resulting in serious injury and/or custodial deaths, it is necessary that     persons be free to complain for a redressal of the same. Such     complaints may not only be made to the State Human Rights     Commission, which is then to utilise its powers, more particularly     under Sections 17 and 18 of the Protection of Human Rights Act,     1993, for redressal of such complaints, but also to Human Rights     Courts, which must then be set up in each District of every     State/Union Territory under Section 30 of the aforesaid Act. The     Commission/Court can then immediately summon CCTV camera     footage in relation to the incident for its safe keeping, which may then     be made available to an investigation agency in order to further     process the complaint made to it.  19. The Union of India is also to file an affidavit in which it will update this     Court on the constitution and workings of the Central Oversight Body,     giving full particulars thereof. In addition, the Union of India is also                                                                                       9    directed to install CCTV cameras and recording equipment in the     offices of:     (i) Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)     (ii) National Investigation Agency (NIA)     (iii) Enforcement Directorate (ED)     (iv) Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB)     (v) Department of Revenue Intelligence (DRI)     (vi) Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO)     (vii) Any other agency which carries out interrogations and has the    power of arrest.     As most of these agencies carry out interrogation in their office(s),     CCTVs shall be compulsorily installed in all offices where such     interrogation and holding of accused takes place in the same manner     as it would in a police station.     The COB shall perform the same function as the SLOC for the offices     of investigative/enforcement agencies mentioned above both in Delhi     and outside Delhi wherever they be located.  20. The SLOC and the COB (where applicable) shall give directions to all     Police Stations, investigative/enforcement agencies to prominently     display at the entrance and inside the police stations/offices of     investigative/enforcement agencies about the coverage of the     concerned premises by CCTV. This shall be done by large posters in     English, Hindi and vernacular language. In addition to the above, it                                                                              10    shall be clearly mentioned therein that a person has a right to     complain about human rights violations to the National/State Human     Rights Commission, Human Rights Court or the Superintendent of     Police or any other authority empowered to take cognizance of an     offence. It shall further mention that CCTV footage is preserved for a     certain minimum time period, which shall not be less than six months,     and the victim has a right to have the same secured in the event of     violation of his human rights.  21. Since these directions are in furtherance of the fundamental rights of     each citizen of India guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution     of India, and since nothing substantial has been done in this regard     for a period of over 2½ years since our first Order dated 03.04.2018,     the Executive/Administrative/police authorities are to implement this     Order both in letter and in spirit as soon as possible. Affidavits will be     filed by the Principal Secretary/Cabinet Secretary/Home Secretary of     each State/ Union Territory giving this Court a firm action plan with     exact timelines for compliance with today’s Order. This is to be done     within a period of six weeks from today.  22. We record our gratitude to Shri Siddhartha Dave, learned Amicus     Curiae, for rendering his services to this Court.  23. The Supreme Court registry to send a copy of this Order to all     Chief/Principal Secretaries of all the States and Union Territories,                                                                                    11    both by physical as well as electronic means, today itself.  24.

(SEAMEC LTD.)                                             JUDGMENT             N. V. RAMANA, J.            Civil Appeal No. 673 of 2012 Signature Not Verified             1. The present appeal arises out of impugned judgment and order Digitally signed by GEETA AHUJA Date: 2020.05.11 15:37:43 IST Reason:                          dated 13.12.2007 in Arbitration Appeal No. 11 of 2006 passed                                                    1   by the Gauhati High Court, wherein the High Court allowed    the appeal preferred by the Respondent under Section 37 of    the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter the    “Arbitration Act”), and set aside the arbitral award dated    19.12.2003.  2. Brief facts necessary for the disposal of this case are as    follows:   appellant   was   awarded   the   work   order   dated    20.07.1995 pursuant to a tender floated by the Respondent in    1994. The contract agreement was for the purpose of well    drilling and other auxiliary operations in Assam, and the same    was effectuated from 05.06.1996. Although, the contract was    initially only for a period of two years, the same was extended    for two successive periods of one year each by mutual    agreement, and finally the contract expired on 04.10.2000.  3. During the subsistence of the contract, the prices of High­    Speed Diesel (“HSD”), one of the essential materials for    carrying out the drilling operations, increased. Appellant    raised a claim that increase in the price of HSD, an essential    component for carrying out the contract triggered the “change    in law” clause under the contract (i.e., Clause 23) and the    Respondent became liable to reimburse them for the same.                                  2   When the Respondent kept on rejecting the claim, the    Appellant eventually invoked the arbitration clause vide letter    dated 01.03.1999. The dispute was referred to an Arbitral    Tribunal comprising of three arbitrators.  4. On 19.12.2003, the Arbitral Tribunal issued the award in A.P    No. 8 of 1999. The majority opinion allowed the claim of the    Appellant and awarded a sum of Rs. 98,89,564.33 with    interest @10% per annum from the date of the award till the    recovery of award money. The amount was subsequently    revised to Rs. 1,32,32,126.36 on 11.03.2005. The Arbitral    Tribunal held that while an increase in HSD price through a    circular issued under the authority of State or Union is not a    “law” in the literal sense, but has the “force of law” and thus    falls within the ambit of Clause 23. On the other hand, the    minority held that the executive orders do not come within the    ambit of Clause 23 of the Contract.   5. Aggrieved by the award, the Respondent challenged the same    under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act before the District    Judge. On 04.07.2006, the learned District Judge, upheld the    award and held that the findings of the tribunal were not                                   3   without basis or against the public policy of India or patently    illegal and did not warrant judicial interference.   6. The Respondent challenged the order of the District Judge by    filing an appeal under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act, before    the High Court. By the impugned judgment, the High Court,    allowed the appeal and set aside the award passed by the    Arbitral Tribunal.   7. The High Court held that the interpretation of the terms of the    contract by the Arbitral Tribunal is erroneous and is against    the public policy of India. On the scope of judicial review under    Section 37 of the Arbitration Act, the High Court held that the    Court had the power to set aside the award as it was passed    overlooking the terms and conditions of the contract. Aggrieved    by the same, the appellant has filed this present appeal by the    way of special leave petition against the impugned judgment.   8. Learned Counsel for the Appellant assailing the impugned    order contends that        a. The High Court has imparted its own personal view as to        the intent for inclusion of Clause 23 and has sat in        appeal over the award of the Arbitral Tribunal. The                                   4           construction of Clause 23, he submitted, is a matter of           interpretation and has been correctly interpreted by the           Arbitral Tribunal based on the authorities cited before it.          b. If two views are possible on a question of law, the High           Court cannot substitute one view and deference should           be given to the plausible view of the Arbitral Tribunal.           Learned counsel has relied upon a judgment of this Court           in McDermott International Inc. v. Burn Standard Co.           Ltd. [(2006) 11 SCC 181] to support his contention.          c. The question of law decided by the Arbitral Tribunal is           beyond judicial review and thus the High Court could not           have interfered with a reasoned award which was neither           against public policy of India nor patently illegal.  9. In    response,   the   learned   counsel   for   the   Respondent,    supporting the findings of the High Court, submits that           a. the award passed by the Arbitral Tribunal is contrary to           the terms of the contract and essentially re­writes the           contract. The Arbitral Tribunal has to adjudicate the           dispute within the four corners of the contract and thus           awarding additional reimbursement not contemplated           under Clause 23 is perverse and patently illegal.          b. Overlooking the terms and conditions of a contract is           violative of Section 28 of the Arbitration Act and thus the           tribunal has exceeded its jurisdiction.                                       5        c. This is not a case where the Arbitral Tribunal accepted          one interpretation of the terms of the contract where two          interpretations were possible. Findings of the Tribunal          are perverse and unreasonable as the Tribunal did not          consider the contract as a whole and failed to follow the          cardinal principle of interpretation of contract.         d. The Arbitral Tribunal has re­written the contract in the          guise of interpretation and such interpretation being in          conflict with the terms of the contract, is in conflict with          the public policy of India.  10. We have heard the learned counsels for the parties and      perused the materials on record.  11. In order to answer the questions raised in this appeal we first      need to delve into the ambit and scope of the court’s      jurisdiction under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act. Section 34      of the Arbitration Act provides as under –         34. Application for setting aside arbitral award. — (1)        Recourse to a Court against an arbitral award may be made        only by an application for setting aside such award in        accordance with sub­section (2) and sub­section (3).         (2) An arbitral award may be set aside by the Court only if—          (a) the party making the application furnishes proof that—                   (i) a party was under some incapacity, or                   (ii) the arbitration agreement is not valid under                  the law to which the parties have subjected it or,                                     6      failing any indication thereon, under the law for      the time being in force; or       (iii) the party making the application was not      given proper notice of the appointment of an      arbitrator or of the arbitral proceedings or was      otherwise unable to present his case; or       (iv) the arbitral award deals with a dispute not      contemplated by or not falling within the terms of      the submission to arbitration, or it contains      decisions on matters beyond the scope of the      submission to arbitration:       Provided that, if the decisions on matters      submitted to arbitration can be separated from      those not so submitted, only that part of the      arbitral award which contains decisions on      matters not submitted to arbitration may be set      aside; or       (v) the composition of the arbitral tribunal or the      arbitral procedure was not in accordance with the      agreement of the parties, unless such agreement      was in conflict with a provision of this Part from      which the parties cannot derogate, or, failing      such agreement, was not in accordance with this      Part; or  (b) the Court finds that—       (i) the subject­matter of the dispute is not capable      of settlement by arbitration under the law for the      time being in force, or       (ii) the arbitral award is in conflict with the public      policy of India.  Explanation. —Without prejudice to the generality of sub­clause (ii) it is hereby declared, for the avoidance of any doubt, that an award is in conflict with the public policy of India if the making of the award was                          7            induced or affected by fraud or corruption or was in            violation of section 75 or section 81.        (3) An application for setting aside may not be made after       three months have elapsed from the date on which the party       making that application had received the arbitral award or,       if a request had been made under section 33, from the date       on which that request had been disposed of by the arbitral       tribunal: Provided that if the Court is satisfied that the       applicant was prevented by sufficient cause from making       the application within the said period of three months it       may entertain the application within a further period of       thirty days, but not thereafter.        (4) On receipt of an application under sub­section (1), the       Court may, where it is appropriate and it is so requested by       a party, adjourn the proceedings for a period of time       determined by it in order to give the arbitral tribunal an       opportunity to resume the arbitral proceedings or to take       such other action as in the opinion of arbitral tribunal will       eliminate the grounds for setting aside the arbitral award.    12. It is a settled position that a Court can set aside the award      only on the grounds as provided in the Arbitration Act as      interpreted by the Courts. Recently, this Court in Dyna      Technologies Pvt. Ltd. v. Crompton Greaves Ltd. [2019 SCC      Online SC 1656] laid down the scope of such interference. This      Court observed as follows­               “26. There is no dispute that Section 34 of              the Arbitration Act limits a challenge to an              award only on the grounds provided therein              or as interpreted by various Courts. We need              to be cognizant of the fact that arbitral                                   8              awards should not be interfered with in a              casual and cavalier manner, unless the              Court comes to a conclusion that the              perversity of the award goes to the root of              the matter without there being a              possibility of alternative interpretation              which may sustain the arbitral award.              Section 34 is different in its approach and              cannot be equated with a normal appellate              jurisdiction. The mandate under Section 34              is to respect the finality of the arbitral award              and the party autonomy to get their dispute              adjudicated by an alternative forum as              provided under the law. If the Courts were to              interfere with the arbitral award in the usual              course on factual aspects, then the              commercial wisdom behind opting for              alternate dispute resolution would stand              frustrated.”                                                 (emphasis supplied)   13. It is also settled law that where two views are possible, the      Court cannot interfere in the plausible view taken by the      arbitrator supported by reasoning. This Court in Dyna      Technologies (supra) observed as under­               “27. Moreover, umpteen number of judgments              of this Court have categorically held that the              Courts should not interfere with an award              merely because an alternative view on facts              and interpretation of contract exists. The              Courts need to be cautious and should defer              to the view taken by the Arbitral Tribunal              even if the reasoning provided in the award              is implied unless such award portrays                                   9                 perversity unpardonable under Section 34                 of the Arbitration Act.”                                                             (emphasis supplied)   14.    However, the question in the present case is whether the        interpretation provided to the contract in the award of the        Tribunal was reasonable and fair, so that the same passes the        muster under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act?  15. In the present case, respondent has argued that the view        taken by the Arbitral Tribunal was not even a possible        interpretation, therefore the award being unreasonable and        unfair suffers from perversity. Hence, the respondent has        pleaded that the award ought to be set aside. In this context,        we may state that usually the Court is not required to examine        the merits of the interpretation provided in the award by the        arbitrator,   if   it   comes   to        a   conclusion   that   such   an        interpretation was reasonably possible.  16. We begin by looking at the clause, i.e Clause 23 which is        extracted below:                      SUBSEQUENTLY ENACTED LAWS: ­                      Subsequent to the date of price of Bid                     Opening if there is a change in or                     enactment of any law or interpretation of                                            10                 existing law, which results in additional                 cost/reduction in cost to Contractor on                 account of the operation under the                 Contract,    the   Company/Contractor                 shall                     reimburse/pay                 Contractor/Company          for     such                 additional/reduced      cost     actually                 incurred.    17. The Arbitral Tribunal held that this clause must be liberally      construed and any circular of the Government of India would      amount to a change in law. The Arbitral Tribunal observed:                  “According to Rule of Construction of any                 document harmonious approach should                 be made reading or taking the document                 as a whole and exclusion should not be                 readily inferred unless it is clearly stated                 in the particular clause of the document.                 This is according to Rule of Interpretation.                 A consistent interpretation should be                 given with a view to smooth working of the                 system, which the document purports to                 regulate. The word, which makes it                 inconsistent or unworkable, should be                 avoided. This is known as beneficial                 construction and a construction should be                 made which suppress the mischief and                 advance the remedies. So, the increase in                 the operational cost due to enhanced price                 of the diesel is one of the subject matters                 of the contract as enshrined in Cl. 23. It                 may be said that Cl. 23 may be termed as                 ‘‘Habendum Clause”. In the deed of the                 contract containing various granting                 clauses and the habendum signifying the                 intention of, the grantor.                                   11             That Cl. 23 requires liberal interpretation             for interpreting the expression ‘law’ or             change in law etc. will also be evident             from the facts that the respondents Oil             India Ltd. through its witness Mr. Pasrija             has clearly stated that the change in             diesel price or any other oil price was             never done and by way of any statutory             enactment either by Parliament or by             State Legislature So, it is clear that at the             time when the Cl. 23 was incorporated in             the agreement the Oil India Ltd. was very             much aware that change in oil price was             never made by any Statutory Legislation             but only by virtue of Government Order,             Resolution, Instruction, as the case may             be, on accepting that a condition of the             appropriate committee namely O.P.C. it is             also clear to apply when there is change in             oil price, here HSD, by the Government             and its statutory authority as enacted in             the above without resorting any statutory             enactment.       Therefore      that      the             interpretation of expression ‘law’ or             change in law etc. requires this extended             meaning to include the statutory law, or             any order, instruction and resolution             issued by the Central Government in its             Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas.”   The majority award utilizes ‘liberal interpretation rule’ to  construe the contract, so that the price escalation of HSD  could be brought under the Clause 23 of the contract. Further  the Arbitral Tribunal identifies the aforesaid clause to be a                                  12     ‘Habendum Clause’, wherein the rights granted to the      appellant are required to be construed broadly.   18. On the other hand, the High Court in the impugned order,      interpreted the same clause as follows:                   “27…I am of the firm view that clause 23                  was inserted in the agreement to meet                  such     uncertain      and     unforeseen                  eventualities and certainly not for revising                  a fixed rate of contract. I also find that                  both parties had agreed to keep “force                  majeure” clause in the agreement. Under                  this doctrine of commercial law, a                  contract agreement can be rescinded for                  acts of God, etc. Under clause 44.3 of the                  agreement, ‘force majeure” has been                  clearly defined, which includes acts and                  regulations of the Government to rescind                  a contract. In this way, clause 23 is very                  close and akin to the “force majeure                  clause”. Besides this, I may also declare                  that clause 23 is pari materia to the                  “doctrine of frustration and supervening                  impossibility”. In other words, under                  clause 23 rights and obligations of both                  the parties have been saved due to any                  change in the existing law or enactment                  of a new law or on the ground of new                  interpretation of the existing law. In my                  opinion, clause 23 must have been made                  a part of the agreement keeping in mind                  section 56 of the Indian Contract Act,                  1872 sans any other intention.”                                       13 19. The High Court, in its reasoning, suggests that Clause 23 is      akin to a force majeure clause. We need to understand the      utility and implications of a force majeure clause. Under Indian      contract law, the consequences of a force majeure event are      provided for under Section 56 of the Contract Act, which states      that on the occurrence of an event which renders the      performance impossible, the contract becomes void thereafter.      Section 56 of the Contract Act stands as follows:             56. Agreement to do impossible act.—An            agreement to do an act impossible in itself is            void.            Contract to do act afterwards becoming            impossible or unlawful—A contract to do an            act which, after the contract is made, becomes            impossible, or, by reason of some event which            the promisor could not prevent, unlawful,            becomes void when the act becomes            impossible or unlawful.   20. When the parties have not provided for what would take place      when an event which renders the performance of the contract      impossible, then Section 56 of the Contract Act applies. When      the act contracted for becomes impossible, then under Section      56, the parties are exempted from further performance and the                                      14     contract becomes void. As held by this Court in Satyabrata      Ghose v. Mugneeram Bangur & Co., AIR 1954 SC 44:             “15. These differences in the way of            formulating legal theories really do not concern            us so long as we have a statutory provision in            the Indian Contract Act. In deciding cases in            India the only doctrine that we have to go by is            that of supervening impossibility or illegality as            laid down in Section 56 of the Contract Act,            taking the word “impossible” in its practical            and not literal sense. It must be borne in            mind, however, that Section 56 lays down a            rule of positive law and does not leave the            matter to be determined according to the            intention of the parties.”                                        (emphasis supplied)      However, there is no doubt that the parties may instead      choose the consequences that would flow on the happening of      an uncertain future event, under Section 32 of the Contract      Act.   21. On the other hand, the common law at one point interpreted      the consequence of such frustration to fall on the party who      sustained loss before the frustrating event. The best example      of such an interpretation can be seen in the line of cases      which came to be known as ‘coronation cases’. In Chandler v.      Webster, [1904] 1 KB 493, Mr. Chandler rented space from                                   15     Mr. Webster for viewing the coronation procession of King      Edward VII to be held on 26 th June 1902. Mr. Chandler had      paid part consideration for the same. However, due to the King      falling ill, the coronation was postponed. As Mr. Webster      insisted on payment of his consideration, the case was brought      to the Court. The Court of Appeals rejected the claims of both      Mr. Chandler as well as Mr. Webster. The essence of the ruling      was that once frustration of contract happens, there cannot be      any enforcement and the loss falls on the person who      sustained it before the force majeure took place.  22. This formulation was over­ruled by the House of Lords in the      historic decision of Fibrosa Spolka Akcyjna v. Fairbairn      Lawson Combe Barbour Ltd., [1942] UKHL 4, wherein the      harsh consequences of frustration as per the old doctrine was      moderated by the introduction of the law of restitution.      Interestingly,   Lord   Shaw   in   Cantiare   San   Rocco   SA      (Shipbuilding     Company)     v.   Clyde   Shipbuilding     and      Engineering Co. Ltd., [1924] AC 226, had observed that      English law of leaving the loss to where it fell unless the      contract provided otherwise was, he said, appropriate only                                      16     ‘among tricksters, gamblers and thieves’. The UK Parliament      took notice of the aforesaid judgment and legislated Law      Reform (Frustrated Contracts) Act, 1943.  23. In India, the Contract Act had already recognized the harsh      consequences of such frustration to some extent and had      provided for a limited mechanism to ameliorate the same      under Section 65 of the Contract Act. Section 65 provides as      under:               65. Obligation of person who has received              advantage under void agreement, or              contract that becomes void               When an agreement is discovered to be void, or              when a contract becomes void, any person who              has received any advantage under such              agreement or contract is bound to restore it, or              to make compensation for it to the person from              whom he received it.        The aforesaid clause provides the basis of restitution for      ‘failure of basis’. We are cognizant that the aforesaid provision      addresses limited circumstances wherein an agreement is void      ab initio or the contract becomes subsequently void.   24. Coming back to the case, the contract has explicitly recognized      force majeure events in Clause 44.3 in the following manner:                                    17             For purpose of this clause “Force Majeure”             means an act of God, war, revolt, riots, strikes,             bandh, fire, flood, sabotage, failure or             destruction of roads, systems and acts and             regulations of the Government of India and             other clauses (but not due to employment             problem of the contractor) beyond the             reasonable control of the parties.        Further, under Clause 22.23, the parties had agreed for a      payment of force majeure rate to tide over any force majeure      event, which is temporary in nature.   25. Having regards to the law discussed herein, we do not      subscribe to either the reasons provided by the Arbitral      Tribunal or the High Court. Although, the Arbitral Tribunal      correctly held that a contract needs to be interpreted taking      into consideration all the clauses of the contract, it failed to      apply the same standard while interpreting Clause 23 of the      Contract.  26. We also do not completely subscribe to the reasoning of the      High Court holding that Clause 23 was inserted in furtherance      of the doctrine of frustration. Rather, under Indian contract      law, the effect of the doctrine of frustration is that it discharges      all the parties from future obligations. In order to mitigate the                                     18     harsh consequences of frustration and to uphold the sanctity      of the contract, the parties with their commercial wisdom,      chose to mitigate the risk under Clause 23 of the contract.  27. Our attention was drawn to Sumitomo Heavy Industries      Limited v. Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited,      (2010) 11 SCC 296, where this Court interpreted an indemnity      clause and found that an additional tax burden could be      recovered under such clause. Based on an appreciation of the      evidence, the Court ruled that additional tax burden could be      recovered under the clause as such an interpretation was a      plausible view that a reasonable person could take and      accordingly sustained the award. However, we are of the      opinion that the aforesaid case and ratio may not be applicable      herein as the evidence on record does not suggest that the      parties had agreed to a broad interpretation to the clause in      question.  28. In this context, the interpretation of Clause 23 of the Contract      by the Arbitral Tribunal, to provide a wide interpretation      cannot be accepted, as the thumb rule of interpretation is that      the document forming a written contract should be read as a      whole and so far as possible as mutually explanatory. In the                                   19     case at hand, this basic rule was ignored by the Tribunal while      interpreting the clause.  29. The contract was entered into between the parties in      furtherance of a tender issued by the Respondent herein. After      considering the tender bids, the Appellant issued a Letter of      Intent. In furtherance of the Letter of Intent, the contract      (Contract No. CCO/FC/0040/95) was for drilling oil wells and      auxiliary operations. It is important to note that the contract      price was payable to the ‘contractor’ for full and proper      performance of its contractual obligations. Further, Clauses      14.7 and 14.11 of the Contract states that the rates, terms and      conditions were to be in force until the completion or      abandonment of the last well being drilled.  30. From the aforesaid discussion, it can be said that the contract      was based on a fixed rate. The party, before entering the      tender process, entered the contract after mitigating the risk of      such an increase. If the purpose of the tender was to limit the      risks of price variations, then the interpretation placed by the      Arbitral Tribunal cannot be said to be possible one, as it would      completely defeat the explicit wordings and purpose of the      contract. There is no gainsaying that there will be price                                    20     fluctuations which a prudent contractor would have taken into      margin, while bidding in the tender. Such price fluctuations      cannot be brought under Clause 23 unless specific language      points to the inclusion.  31. The interpretation of the Arbitral Tribunal to expand the      meaning of Clause 23 to include change in rate of HSD is not a      possible interpretation of this contract, as the appellant did      not introduce any evidence which proves the same.  32. The   other   contractual   terms    also   suggest   that   the      interpretation of the clause, as suggested by the Arbitral      Tribunal, is perverse. For instance, Item 1 of List II      (Consumables) of Exhibit C         (Consolidated Statement    of      Equipment and Services Furnished by Contractor or Operator      for the Onshore Rig Operation), indicates that fuel would be      supplied by the contactor, at his expense. The existence of      such a clause shows that the interpretation of the contract by      the Arbitral Tribunal is not a possible interpretation of the      contract.  33. For the aforesaid reasons, we are not inclined to interfere with      the impugned judgment and order of the High Court setting                                      21   aside the award. The appeal is accordingly dismissed. There    shall be no order as to costs.   CIVIL APPEAL NO. 900   OF   2012  34. In view of the judgment pronounced in C.A. No. 673 of 2012,  the aforesaid matter is disposed of in the aforesaid terms.                                   ..............................................J.

The present appeal has been preferred by Defendant No. 4, against                                the concurrent findings of three Courts arising out of a suit for                                permanent injunction.                            2.   The plaintiffs, now represented as respondent Nos. 1 and 2, filed a                                suit for permanent injunction on 31.7.1971 claiming that Khasra                                No. 238 measuring 4 Bighas 3 Biswas, situated in the revenue                                estate of Village Basai Darapur, Delhi is owned and possessed by                                them.   Earlier, the plaintiffs had filed a suit for declaration                                challenging the vesting of the said land in Gaon Sabha in a suit                                filed on 20.7.1959.     The said suit was decreed on 7.10.1960 Signature Not Verified                                  holding that the plaintiffs are owners and Bhumidars of land Digitally signed by ASHWANI KUMAR Date: 2020.11.16 17:58:33 IST Reason:                                 comprising in Khasra No. 238. The Union of India had filed an                                application under Section 161-B of the Delhi Land Reforms Act,                                                                                                  1         19541 for setting aside the said decree dated 7.10.1960 but such          application was dismissed by Sub-Judge, First Class, Delhi on          24.5.1968.   3.      The plaintiffs alleged that defendant No. 1 claimed that Khasra No.          238 is part of the land allotted to it.    The suit for permanent          injunction was thus filed by the plaintiffs apprehending threat to          their possession of land comprising Khasra No. 238, Village Basai          Darapur, Delhi against defendant No. 1 i.e. The Refugees’ Co-          operative Housing Society Ltd., its President – defendant No. 2,          Secretary – defendant No. 3 and defendant No. 4, Kirpa Ram,          predecessor in interest of the present appellants.     Two separate          sets of written statements were filed before the Court, one by          defendant Nos. 1 to 3 and another by defendant No. 4.            The          defendant Nos. 1 to 3 raised preliminary objection that the          jurisdiction of the Civil Court relating to Bhumidari land is barred          under Section 85 of the Reforms Act. It was stated that defendant          No. 4 threatened to encroach upon the land in the Society          comprising of Khasra No. 1273 which led to proceedings under          Section 145 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.            Such          proceedings have nothing to do with land comprising in Khasra No.          238.   4.      The defendant No. 4 in written statement asserted that the          plaintiffs were not in possession of the land in dispute and suit for          injunction was therefore not maintainable.     It was further stated 1    For short, the ‘Reforms Act’                                                                              2      that defendant Nos. 1 to 3 were not concerned with the land in       question and that land did not belong either to plaintiffs or       defendant Nos. 1 to 3 and they were not in possession thereof.       Such land was in fact only in the possession of the defendant No.       4. It was also stated that the land in dispute does not bear Khasra       No. 238 and that it is not situated in the revenue estate of Village       Basai Darapur. Instead, the land in dispute bears Khasra No. 79       and is situated in revenue estate of Village Shakarpur.   5.   In view of the pleadings of the parties, the following issues were       framed by the trial court:              “1. Whether any notice u/s 70 of the Bombay Societies             Act as extended to the Delhi was not necessary to be             served on the defendants no. 1 to 3 before instituting             the present suit? If so, then to what effect? (Objected             to).              2. Whether this Court has no jurisdiction to try this suit             as mentioned in the written statement?              3. Whether the plaintiffs are the owners in possession             of the land in dispute bearing khasra no. 238 as alleged             in the plaint?              4. Whether the land in dispute formed the part of             khasra no. 238 of village Basai Darapur, Delhi as alleged             in the plaint?              5. Whether the land in dispute formed the part of             khasra no. 79 situated in village Shakar Pur as             mentioned in the written statement? (objected to)              6. Whether this suit is properly valued for the purposes             of court fee and jurisdiction? If not, then to what effect?              7. Whether the suit is bad on account of mis-joinder of             defendants as mentioned in the written statement? If             so, then to what effect?                                                                              3               8. Whether the plaintiffs are entitled for a decree for               permanent injunction claimed in the plaint?                9. Relief.”   6.   With respect of Issue No. 2, the learned trial court held that the suit       was a simpliciter suit for injunction and the Court has the       jurisdiction to find out in which khasra number the land in dispute       falls.   It was thus held that suit land falls in Khasra No. 238 in       Village Basai Darapur and is in the possession of the plaintiffs,       therefore, the suit was decreed.   7.   Issue Nos. 4 and 5 were taken up for decision together.                 The       plaintiffs had produced site plan (Ex.PW-3/1) pertaining to the year       1953-54 when consolidation took place in Village Shakarpur. The       plaintiffs also produced site plan (Ex.PW-3/3) of Village Basai       Darapur.    The learned trial court held that the consolidation had       taken place in Village Shakarpur and not in Village Basai Darapur.       Therefore, the area of Khasra No. 238 could not be reduced from 4       Bighas 3 Biswas to 2 Bighas 6 Biswas. It was held by the trial court       as under:                “18. …One thing remains certain that the present               defendants have no concern in Khasra no. 238 village               Basai Darapur. Either it belongs to the plaintiffs or it               vests in the Gaon Sabha. The present defendants, who               are third parties, have no right to challenge the said               judgment and decree passed in favour of the present               plaintiffs. Therefore, I hold that plaintiffs are the owners               of khasra no. 238, village Basai Darapur.”   8.   The first appeal was filed by defendant No. 4 only.                The First                                                                                    4       Appellate Court after reappreciating the evidence recorded the        following findings:                “14.    From the above discussion it is clear that               appellant/defendant No.4 has not been successful               before the trial court to show that he was in possession               of Khasra No.79 of village Shakarpur so he cannot say               that he is entitled to possession of the same under the               claim that this land forms part of Khasra No. 79 of               village Shakarpur and not to Khasra No. 238 of village               Basaidarapur. The claim of appellant/defendant No.4               stands falsifies upon his own documents produced by               him before.”   9.    In the memorandum of second appeal, the defendant No. 4 alleged        that   the      following   substantial   questions   of   law   arise   for        consideration:                “1. Whether the appellate court could in law dispose of               the appeal without deciding the Preliminary issue of               jurisdiction of the civil court.                2. Whether the appellate court could in law dispose of               the appeal without passing any order on the application               dated 18th October, 1984 of the appellant under order               41 rule 27 of the Civil Procedure Code for permission to               lead additional evidence?                3. Whether the appellate court in law was jurisdiction in               not considering the provision of section 28 of the Delhi               Land Revenue Act, 1974 which bars the jurisdiction of               the Civil Court to entertain boundary disputes?”   10.   The first substantial question of law was based on an interim order        passed by the First Appellate Court on 9.5.1996 wherein the parties        were directed to first address the arguments on the issue of        jurisdiction.    It has also come on record that the High Court had        directed reconstruction of the record of the First Appellate Court on        31.7.2007, as the same was destroyed in an incident of fire during                                                                                  5          the year 1996.   11.      The second substantial question of law raised was in respect of an           application for additional evidence filed under Order XLI Rule 27 of           the Civil Procedure Code2. The defendant No. 4 sought to produce           the revenue record, Khasra Girdawari for the years 1953-54, 1954-           55, 1955-56, 1956-57, 1966-67 and 1983-84, Jamabandi for the           year 1944-45 and mutation No. 2151, all of which pertained to           Village Basai Darapur vide the said application.   12.      Mr. Mehta, learned senior counsel for the appellants vehemently           argued that the jurisdiction of Civil Court is barred as it is a           boundary dispute between the Village Basai Darapur and Village           Shakarpur and such dispute has to be decided in terms of Section           28 of the Delhi Land Revenue Act, 1954 by the Commissioner.   13.      The High Court vide judgment dated 25.8.2008 dismissed the           second appeal filed by the appellants herein.      Aggrieved by the           findings of the High Court, defendant No. 4 is in appeal before this           Court.  14.      The primary argument raised by learned counsel for the appellants           is that the High Court has dismissed the appeal without framing           any substantial question of law which is mandatory in terms of           Section 100 of the Code.     It was submitted that since the High           Court has dismissed the appeal without framing substantial           question of law, the matter should be remitted back to the High   2     For short, the ‘Code’                                                                              6       Court for determination of such substantial question of law framed        by the appellants, as reproduced above.                       In support of the        arguments, the appellants relied upon various judgments3.   15.   It has been argued that the First Appellate Court had ordered that        the question of jurisdiction of Civil Court would be decided first,        however the appeal was decided without dealing with the said        issue.    It is, thus, said to have caused serious prejudice to the        rights of the appellants. Similarly, the application under Order XLI        Rule 27 of the Code was not decided which was again prejudicial to        their rights.   16.   We find that such substantial questions of law, in fact, do not arise        for consideration. The issue of jurisdiction was not an issue of fact        but of law. Therefore, it could very well be decided by the First        Appellate Court while taking up the entire appeal for hearing. The        trial court had also not treated issue No. 2 relating to the        jurisdiction of the Civil Court as a preliminary issue. Therefore, it        cannot be said that any prejudice has been caused to the        appellants by not deciding the issue of jurisdiction of the Civil Court        in the first instance by the First Appellate Court. It may also be        noticed that the plea of bar of jurisdiction was raised by defendant        Nos. 1 to 3 and not by the appellants.      3    Md. Mohammad Ali (dead) by LRs v. Jagadish Kalita & Ors., (2004) 1 SCC 271; Hubli       Dharwar Municipal Corporation & Anr. v. H.S. Mohd. Khan (dead) by LRs. & Ors. , (2002) 2       SCC 109; Madhavan Nair v.

Santosh Kumar Purkait & Ors., (1997) 5 SCC 438                                                                                              7 17.   Furthermore, the application under Order XLI Rule 27 of the Code        was in respect of revenue documents in respect of Village Basai        Darapur. Admittedly, the appellants have no claim on any part of        the land of Village Basai Darapur. The appellants are asserting their        possession relating to Khasra No. 79 of Village Shakarpur.       The        appellants have sought such revenue record in the additional        evidence as the same was not in their knowledge and that no issue        was also framed as to the correctness of the area of Khasra No. 238        of Village Basai Darapur.      The plaintiffs have asserted their        possession and title over Khasra No. 238 of Village Basai Darapur        whereas defendant No. 4 averred that the land in dispute bears        Khasra No. 79 situated in Village Shakarpur, Delhi. It is to be noted        that Issue Nos. 3, 4 and 5 were related to ownership and        possession of Khasra No. 238 and whether the land in dispute        formed a part of Khasra No. 79 of Village Shakarpur. Therefore, the        entire argument that no issue was framed in respect of correctness        of area of Khasra No. 238 is untenable. The parties have        understood the case about the area of Khasra No. 238 falling in        Basai Darapur or in Khasra No. 79 of Village Shakarpur. Once the        parties have understood the said controversy and had adduced        evidence before the trial court, the appellant cannot be permitted        to produce additional evidence in the first appeal. Thus, the        additional documents cannot be permitted to be produced as they        are not relevant to the plea raised by the appellant.   18.   The Land Revenue Act does not expressly bar the jurisdiction of the                                                                            8       Civil Court in respect of boundary disputes. The boundary disputes        are between two revenue estates and does not include the        demarcation of the land of the parties. Section 83 of the Land        Revenue Act bars the jurisdiction of the Civil Court in respect of :        (a) the arrangement of area of the patwaris; (b) claims by any        person to any of the offices mentioned in section 13 or 14 or to any        emolument or fees appertaining to such office, or in respect of any        injury caused by his exclusion therefrom, or claims by any person        to nominate persons to such offices; (c) the formation of the record        of rights or the preparation, signing, or attestation of any of the        documents contained therein, or the preparation of the annual        register.   No such dispute arises for consideration in the present        matter.  19.   Still further, the suit is simpliciter for injunction based upon        possession of the property. The said suit could be decided only by        the Civil Court as there is no mechanism prescribed under the Land        Revenue Act for grant of injunction in respect of disputes relating to        possession. The Civil Court has plenary jurisdiction to entertain all        disputes except in cases where the jurisdiction of the Civil Court is        either expressly or impliedly barred in terms of Section 9 of the        Code.   20.   Since there is no implied or express bar of jurisdiction of the Civil        Court in terms of Section 9 of the Code, the Civil Court has plenary        jurisdiction to decide all disputes between the parties. The issue of        jurisdiction of the civil court has been considered by this Court in                                                                            9          South Delhi Municipal Corporation & Anr. v. Today Homes           and Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. etc.4 wherein this Court held as           under:                    “11. Any person having a grievance that he had been                   wronged or his right has been affected can approach a                   civil court on the principle of ‘ ubi jus ibi remedium’ -                   where there is a right, there is a remedy. As no internal                   remedy had been provided in different statutes creating                   rights or liabilities, the ordinary civil courts had to                   examine the grievances in the light of those statutes.                   With the advent of a ‘Welfare State’, it was realised that                   enactments creating liabilities in respect of payment of                   taxes, obligations after vesting of estates and conferring                   rights on a class of citizens, should be complete codes                   by themselves. With that object in view, forums were                   created under the Acts themselves where grievances                   could be entertained on behalf of the persons aggrieved                   (Shiv Kumar Chadha v. Municipal Corporation of                   Delhi, (1993) 3 SCC 161).                    12. Wherever a right or liability, not pre-existing in                   common law is created by a statute and that statute                   itself provides a machinery for enforcement of such                   right or liability, both the right/liability and the remedy                   having been created uno flatu and a finality is intended                   to the result of the statutory proceedings, then, even in                   the absence of an exclusionary provision the jurisdiction                   of the civil court is impliedly barred. ( Raja Ram Kumar                   Bhargava (Dead) By LRs v. Union of India, (1988) 1 SCC                   681).                   13. We find that a liability for payment of tax is created                   by the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957. Further, a                   remedy by way of an appeal against an order of                   assessment, before an appropriate forum or authority,                   has been provided by the same statute.”  21.      In view of the above, we find that the High Court did not commit           any illegality in not framing any substantial question of law while           dismissing the appeal filed by the appellants.   22.      The argument of Mr. Mehta is that substantial question of law is  4     2019 SCC OnLine SC 1052                                                                                  10       required to be framed by the High Court while deciding the second        appeal. We don’t find any merit in the argument. Section 100 of        the Code reads as under:               “100. Second appeal.—(1) Save as otherwise              expressly provided in the body of this Code or by any              other law for the time being in force, an appeal shall lie              to the High Court from every decree passed in appeal by              any Court subordinate to the High Court, if the High              Court is satisfied that the case involves a substantial              question of law.               (2) An appeal may lie under this section from an              appellate decree passed ex parte.               (3) In an appeal under this section, the memorandum of              appeal shall precisely state the substantial question of              law involved in the appeal.               (4) Where the High Court is satisfied that a substantial              question of law is involved in any case, it shall formulate              that question.               (5) The appeal shall be heard on the question so              formulated and the respondent shall, at the hearing of              the appeal, be allowed to argue that the case does not              involve such question:               Provided that nothing in this sub-section shall be              deemed to take away or abridge the power of the Court              to hear, for reasons to be recorded, the appeal on any              other substantial question of law, not formulated by it, if              it is satisfied that the case involves such question.”   23.   Sub-section (1) of Section 100 of the Code contemplates that an        appeal shall lie to the High Court if it is satisfied that the case        involves a substantial question of law. The substantial question of        law is required to be precisely stated in the memorandum of        appeal. If the High Court is satisfied that such substantial question        of law is involved, it is required to formulate that question.       The                                                                               11       appeal has to be heard on the question so formulated. However,        the Court has the power to hear appeal on any other substantial        question of law on satisfaction of the conditions laid down in the        proviso of Section 100 of the Code. Therefore, if the substantial        question of law framed by the appellants are found to be arising in        the case, only then the High Court is required to formulate the        same for consideration.      If no such question arises, it is not        necessary for the High Court to frame any substantial question of        law.   The formulation of substantial question of law or re-        formulation of the same in terms of the proviso arises only if there        are some questions of law and not in the absence of any        substantial question of law. The High Court is not obliged to frame        substantial question of law, in case, it finds no error in the findings        recorded by the First Appellate Court.   24.   Still further, we find that none of the judgments referred to by the        learned counsel for the appellants mandate the High Court to        frame substantial questions of law while upholding the findings        recorded by the First Appellate Court. All the judgments referred to        by the learned counsel for the appellants except in               Md.        Mohammad Ali are the judgments wherein the High Court has set        aside the findings of the First Appellate Court without framing        substantial questions of law. In Md. Mohammad Ali, this Court        found that the High Court erred in dismissing the appeal without        formulation of substantial question of law which arises for        consideration. This Court held as under:                                                                             12                   “33. The proposition of law relating to ouster of a co-                   sharer vis-à-vis adverse possession had been overlooked                   by the High Court. There are also certain other aspects                   of the matter which could not be overlooked and                   probably would require closer examination by the High                   Court.                   34. The High Court while determining the question                   should have formulated substantial questions of law in                   terms of Section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure,                   1908. In absence of formulation of such substantial                   questions of law, probably the High Court committed the                   errors as pointed out hereinbefore.”   25.     In a judgment reported as Ashok Rangnath Magar v. Shrikant          Govindrao Sangvikar5, this Court held that the second appeal          can be dismissed without even formulating the substantial question          of law. The Court held as under:                     “18. In the light of the provision contained in Section                   100 CPC and the ratio decided by this Court, we come to                   the following conclusion:                    (i) On the day when the second appeal is listed for                   hearing on admission if the High Court is satisfied that                   no substantial question of law is involved, it shall                   dismiss the second appeal without even formulating the                   substantial question of law;                    (ii) In cases where the High Court after hearing the                   appeal is satisfied that the substantial question of law is                   involved, it shall formulate that question and then the                   appeal shall be heard on those substantial question of                   law, after giving notice and opportunity of hearing to the                   respondent;                    (iii) In no circumstances the High Court can reverse the                   judgment of the trial court and the first appellate court                   without formulating the substantial question of law and                   complying with the mandatory requirements of Section                   100 CPC.”     5     (2015) 16 SCC 763                                                                                  13 26.   In view of the above findings, we do not find any error in the        judgment and order of the High Court dismissing the Second        Appeal.      The present appeal is thus dismissed.

A revision petition 1 filed by the fourth            respondent against an order of the Additional Junior Civil Judge, Sattenapalli was            allowed and directions were issued for the framing of charges against the            appellant under Sections 406 and 420 of the Indian Penal Code 1860 2.             2              On 10 March 2011, a First Information Report 3 was lodged by the fourth            respondent, who is the father-in-law of the appellant, alleging that the appellant Signature Not Verified  Digitally signed by           and the members of his family had harassed his daughter with demands for CHETAN KUMAR Date: 2020.01.21 16:18:40 IST Reason:             1 Criminal Revision Case no 2712 of 2017           2 “IPC”           3 “FIR”            1 money and transfer of land in their names. The FIR recites that the appellant and  the daughter of the fourth respondent got married in 2003. Allegedly, in 2006 the  appellant and his family refused to take the complainant’s daughter to the United  Kingdom where her husband was staying unless her Stridhana property was  transferred in their names.   3       On 30 June 2012, a charge-sheet was filed against the appellant and his  parents for offences under Section 498A of the IPC along with Sections 3 and 4  of the Dowry Prohibition Act 1961 4. The investigating officer, upon receipt of  additional information about the commission of other offences by the appellant,  obtained permission from the Trial Court for further investigation. Based on the  statements of various witnesses under Section 161 of the Code of Criminal  Procedure 19735 with respect to the appellant raising a demand of Rs 5,00,000/-  for securing a job for the complainant’s daughter as a doctor in the United  Kingdom, an additional charge-sheet was filed on 12 April 2013 in respect of the  alleged commission of offences under Sections 406 and 420 of the IPC. The Trial  Court framed charges against the appellant only for offences mentioned in the  original charge-sheet dated 30 June 2012 under Section 498A of the IPC along  with Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act. The trial commenced and  after the recording of evidence and conclusion of arguments, the case was  reserved for judgment on 13 February 2017.   4       On 13 February 2017, an application was filed by the Public Prosecutor  under Section 216 of CrPC for alteration of charge stating that even though an   4 “Dowry Prohibition Act” 5 “CrPC”  2 additional charge-sheet had been filed by the investigating officer on 12 April  2013 implicating the appellant for crimes under Sections 406 and 420, charges  were not framed by the trial judge under those provisions. On 21 February 2017,  the Trial Court allowed the application and charges under Sections 406 and 420  were framed against the appellant. The Trial Court observed that the court only  had the opportunity of going through the original charge-sheet dated 30 June  2012 and not the additional charge-sheet dated 12 April 2013 that was kept in a  separate bundle. Aggrieved by the order of the Trial Court, the appellant instituted  revisional proceedings before the High Court.   5       On 1 June 2017, a Single Judge of the High Court allowed the revision  petition6 and set aside the order of the Trial Court framing additional charges on  the ground of procedural irregularity but left it open to the Trial Court to frame, if  at all necessary, any additional charges after providing both the sides with an  opportunity of hearing and recalling witnesses.   6       The Trial Court after hearing arguments on behalf of both the sides and  perusing the material available on record concluded that the ingredients for  offences under Sections 406 and 420 IPC were not made out and by an order  dated 11 October 2017 rejected the application for framing additional charges.  The fourth respondent filed a revision petition before the High Court against the  above order of the Trial Court.   7       On 6 March 2019, a Single Judge of the High Court allowed the revision  petition7 and set aside the Trial Court’s order. The High Court held that the Trial  6 Criminal Revision Case no 661 of 2017 7 Criminal Revision Case no 2712 of 2017  3 Court while rejecting the application under Section 216 did not disclose the  reasons for concluding that the ingredients of Sections 406 and 420 were not  attracted and only touched upon the lapses of the prosecution in not seeking an  alteration of charges during the course of the trial. The High Court while directing  the framing of additional charges under Sections 406 and 420 of IPC evaluated  the witness statements brought on record during the course of investigation and  referred to the additional charge-sheet filed on 12 April 2013.   8         Aggrieved by the order dated 6 March 2019 of the High Court, the  appellant moved this Court under Article 136 of the Constitution.   9         Ms Anitha Shenoy, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the  appellant has urged the following submissions:       (a)     An application for alteration of charge under Section 216 was              intentionally filed on the date of the pronouncement of judgment to              unnecessarily delay the proceedings;     (b)     The FIR dated 10 March 2011, filed by the fourth respondent, has no              mention of any demand or payment of Rs 5,00,000/- to the appellant for              securing a job for the complainant’s daughter. The FIR only refers to              facts with respect to alleged offences under Section 498A of the IPC              and Section 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act;     (c)     Both the fourth respondent and his daughter being doctors are aware              that a doctor’s job cannot be secured in the United Kingdom without              clearing an entrance test. Accordingly, the question of paying Rs              5,00,000/- to the appellant for securing a job does not arise;     4      (d)     PW 6, who is a friend of the fourth respondent is an interested witness               as they have been friends for the past twenty-five years;      (e)     PW 5, who is the brother-in-law of the fourth respondent, is an               interested witness and during the cross-examination he was unable to               mention the date, month and year on which the alleged amount was               paid to the fourth respondent for payment to the appellant. There exists               no documentary material to indicate that the fourth respondent               borrowed money from PW 5; and      (f)     The ingredients of Sections 406 and 420 have not been fulfilled. At the               stage of framing of charge, the court is not expected to go deep into the               probative value of the material on record. The court only needs to               consider whether there is ground for presuming that the offence has               been committed (Onkar Nath Mishra v The State8). There exists a fine               distinction between cheating and a mere breach of contract. It depends               upon the intention of the accused at the time of inducement which may               be judged by his subsequent conduct. To hold a person guilty of               cheating, it is necessary to show existence of fraudulent or dishonest               intention at the time of making the promise. (Hridaya Ranjan Prasad               Verma v State of Bihar9).  10         On the other hand, Mr A T M Ranga Ramanujam, learned Senior Counsel,  appearing on behalf of the fourth respondent submitted thus:       (a)     The fourth respondent did not intend to delay the pronouncement of the               decision. The additional charge sheet and the cognizance order had               been in place before the Trial Court since 2013. The additional charge-   8 (2008) 2 SCC 561 9 (2000) 4 SCC 168  5               sheet missed the attention of the Magistrate because it was kept in a                separate docket;      (b)      The charge can be altered by the court at any time before the                pronouncement of the judgment based on the materials available or                subsequently brought on record during the course of the trial (Anant                Prakash Sinha v State of Haryana10). In the present case, the                investigating officer filed the additional charge-sheet only after he                received additional information during the course of investigation in                relation to offences under Sections 406 and 420 of the IPC. Though,                the appellant was initially charged in pursuance of the original charge-                sheet dated 30 June 2012, subsequent evidence brought on record                does not restrict the court from altering the charge; and      (c)      At the time of framing of charge, it is sufficient if the court is able to form                a presumption regarding the existence of ingredients constituting the                offence found upon the material placed before it. It is not necessary for                the court to undertake an analysis of the credibility, veracity or                evidentiary value of the materials placed before it (Sajjan Kumar v                Central Bureau of Investigation11).  11         The rival submissions fall for our consideration.   12         In the present case, the investigating officer upon receipt of additional  information about the alleged commission of offences under Sections 406 and  420 by the appellant, obtained permission for further investigation. Statements of  witnesses recorded under Section 161 of CrPC indicated that the appellant had  raised a demand of Rs 5,00,000/- for securing a doctor’s job for the complainant’s  10 (2016) 6 SCC 105 11 (2010) 9 SCC 368  6 daughter in the United Kingdom. After investigation, an additional charge-sheet  was filed on 12 April 2013 against the appellant for offences under Sections 406  and 420 of the IPC. This is evident from the counter affidavit filed by the fourth  respondent before this Court which contains the docket order of the Additional  Junior Civil Judge, Sattenapalli. In an order dated 16 August 2013 it was stated:                “... Additional charge sheet filed by investigating officer              through learned APP. This case was taken on file u/s 498 -A              of IPC and Sec. 4 of D.P. Act against A.1 to A.3 on              28.09.2012. Perused the Addl. Charge Sheet and other              available material on record. Heard learned APP. It is a fit              case to take on file Section 406 and 420 of IPC also              against A.1. Call on 16.09.2013.”      (Emphasis supplied)    The order dated 13 February 2017 stated thus:               “... In the case on hand, initially charge sheet was filed for the              offence u/s 498-A IPC, Sec. 3 & 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act              and the cognizance was taken for those offences by my              predecessor. Later an additional charge sheet was filed by              the investigation officer in this case and my predecessor              was please to take cognizance of offences punishable u/s              406, 420 IPC also on 16.08.2013. But the fact of filing of              additional charge sheet was not brought to the notice of              this Court and the additional charge sheet was kept as a              separate bundle in the record. So, charges were framed              against the accused only for the offence punishable u/s              498-A IPC and Sec. 3, 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act and              Sect. 406 and 420 of IPC were ignored. This fact came out              to the notice of this Court while this Court has gone through              the entire record after hearing arguments for disposal of the              case. On 13.02.2017 the learned Asst. Public Prosecutor has              also filed a petition u/s 216 of CrPC, with a prayer to add              Section 406, 420 of IPC and to frame charges for those              offences also...”                           (Emphasis supplied)    13    It is evident from the record that the earlier Additional Junior Civil Judge  perused the additional charge-sheet and took cognizance of offences under  Sections 406 and 420 of the IPC. However, at the time of framing charges, the    7 additional charge-sheet was not brought to the notice of the court and the framing  of charges against the appellant under Sections 406 and 420 was not  considered. Therefore, the appellant was charged only for offences under Section  498A of the IPC along with Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act. It was  when an application under Section 216 of CrPC was filed by the public  prosecutor on 13 February 2017 that it was brought to the notice of the Trial  Judge that charges under Sections 406 and 420 were not framed.   14    In order to adjudicate upon the dispute, it is necessary to refer to Section  216 of CrPC:               “216. Court may alter charge.—(1) Any court may alter or add              to any charge at any time before judgment is pronounced.               (2) Every such alteration or addition shall be read and              explained to the accused.               (3) If the alteration or addition to a charge is such that              proceeding immediately with the trial is not likely, in the              opinion of the court, to prejudice the accused in his defence              or the prosecutor in the conduct of the case, the court may, in              its discretion, after such alteration or addition has been made,              proceed with the trial as if the altered or added charge had              been the original charge.               (4) If the alteration or addition is such that proceeding              immediately with the trial is likely, in the opinion of the court,              to prejudice the accused or the prosecutor as aforesaid, the              court may either direct a new trial or adjourn the trial for such              period as may be necessary.               (5) If the offence stated in the altered or added charge is one              for the prosecution of which previous sanction is necessary,              the case shall not be proceeded with until such sanction is              obtained, unless sanction has been already obtained for a              prosecution on the same facts as those on which the altered              or added charge is founded.”    15    Section 216 appears in Chapter XVII of the CrPC. Under the provisions of  Section 216, the court is authorised to alter or add to the charge at any time  8 before the judgment is pronounced. Whenever such an alteration or addition is  made, it is to be read out and explained to the accused. The phrase “add to any  charge” in Sub-Section (1) includes addition of a new charge. The provision  enables the alteration or addition of a charge based on materials brought on  record during the course of trial. Section 216 provides that the addition or  alteration has to be done “at any time before judgment is pronounced”. Sub-  Section (3) provides that if the alteration or addition to a charge does not cause  prejudice to the accused in his defence, or the persecutor in the conduct of the  case, the court may proceed with the trial as if the additional or alternative charge  is the original charge. Sub-Section (4) contemplates a situation where the  addition or alteration of charge will prejudice the accused and empowers the  court to either direct a new trial or adjourn the trial for such period as may be  necessary to mitigate the prejudice likely to be caused to the accused. Section  217 of the CrPC deals with recalling of witnesses when the charge is altered or  added by the court after commencement of the trial.    16     The decision of a two-judge Bench of this Court in P Kartikalakshmi v Sri  Ganesh12, dealt with a case where during the course of a trial for an offence  under Section 376 of the IPC, an application under Section 216 was filed to frame  an additional charge for an offence under Section 417 of the IPC. Justice F M  Ibrahim Kalifulla, while dealing with the power of the court to alter or add any  charge, held:                 “6. ... Section 216 CrPC empowers the Court to alter or add                any charge at any time before the judgment is pronounced. It                is now well settled that the power vested in the Court is  12 (2017) 3 SCC 347  9                exclusive to the Court and there is no right in any party to                seek for such addition or alteration by filing any application as                a matter of right. It may be that if there was an omission in                the framing of the charge and if it comes to the                knowledge of the Court trying the offence, the power is                always vested in the Court, as provided under Section                216 CrPC to either alter or add the charge and that such                power is available with the Court at any time before the                judgment is pronounced. It is an enabling provision for                the Court to exercise its power under certain                contingencies which comes to its notice or brought to its                notice. In such a situation, if it comes to the knowledge of                the Court that a necessity has arisen for the charge to be                altered or added, it may do so on its own and no order                need to be passed for that purpose. After such alteration or                addition when the final decision is rendered, it will be open for                the parties to work out their remedies in accordance with law.”                                                            (Emphasis supplied)   17     In Anant Prakash Sinha v State of Haryana13, a two judge Bench of this  Court dealt with a situation where for commission of offences under Sections  498A and 323 of the IPC, an application was filed for framing an additional  charge under Section 406 of the IPC against the husband and the mother-in law.  After referring to various decisions of this Court that dealt with the power of the  court to alter a charge, Justice Dipak Misra (as the learned Chief Justice then  was), held:                  “18. ... the court can change or alter the charge if there is defect                or something is left out. The test is, it must be founded on the                material available on record. It can be on the basis of the                complaint or the FIR or accompanying documents or the                material brought on record during the course of trial. It can                also be done at any time before pronouncement of                judgment. It is not necessary to advert to each and every                circumstance. Suffice it to say, if the court has not framed a                charge despite the material on record, it has the jurisdiction                to add a charge. Similarly, it has the authority to alter the                charge. The principle that has to be kept in mind is that the                charge so framed by the Magistrate is in accord with the                materials produced before him or if subsequent evidence  13 (2016) 6 SCC 105  10                comes on record. It is not to be understood that unless                evidence has been let in, charges already framed cannot be                altered, for that is not the purport of Section 216 CrPC.                 19. In addition to what we have stated hereinabove, another                aspect also has to be kept in mind. It is obligatory on the part of                the court to see that no prejudice is caused to the accused and                he is allowed to have a fair trial. There are in-built safeguards in                Section 216 CrPC. It is the duty of the trial court to bear in mind                that no prejudice is caused to the accused as that has the                potentiality to affect a fair trial...”        (Emphasis supplied)     18     In CBI v Karimullah Osan Khan14, this Court dealt with a case where an  application was filed under Section 216 of CrPC during the course of trial for  addition of charges against the appellant under various provisions of the IPC, the  Explosives Act 1884 and the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act  1987. Justice K S P Radhakrishnan, speaking for the Court, held thus:                 “17. Section 216 CrPC gives considerable power to the                trial court, that is, even after the completion of evidence,                arguments heard and the judgment reserved, it can alter                and add to any charge, subject to the conditions                mentioned therein. The expressions “at any time” and                before the “judgment is pronounced” would indicate that                the power is very wide and can be exercised, in                appropriate cases, in the interest of justice, but at the same                time, the courts should also see that its orders would not                cause any prejudice to the accused.                 18. Section 216 CrPC confers jurisdiction on all courts,                including the Designated Courts, to alter or add to any charge                framed earlier, at any time before the judgment is pronounced                and sub-sections (2) to (5) prescribe the procedure which has                to be followed after that addition or alteration. Needless to                say, the courts can exercise the power of addition or                modification of charges under Section 216 CrPC, only                when there exists some material before the court, which                has some connection or link with the charges sought to                be amended, added or modified. In other words,                alteration or addition of a charge must be for an offence                made out by the evidence recorded during the course of                trial before the court.”  14 (2014) 11 SCC 538  11                                                       (Emphasis supplied)    19     In Jasvinder Saini v State (Govt of NCT of Delhi)15, this Court dealt with  the question whether the Trial Court was justified in adding a charge under  Section 302 of the IPC against the accused persons who were charged under  Section 304B of the IPC. Justice T S Thakur (as he then was) speaking for the  Court, held thus:                 “11. A plain reading of the above would show that the                court's power to alter or add any charge is unrestrained                provided such addition and/or alteration is made before                the judgment is pronounced. Sub-sections (2) to (5) of                Section 216 deal with the procedure to be followed once the                court decides to alter or add any charge. Section 217 of the                Code deals with the recall of witnesses when the charge is                altered or added by the court after commencement of the trial.                There can, in the light of the above, be no doubt about the                competence of the court to add or alter a charge at any time                before the judgment. The circumstances in which such                addition or alteration may be made are not, however,                stipulated in Section 216. It is all the same trite that the                question of any such addition or alternation would                generally arise either because the court finds the charge                already framed to be defective for any reason or because                such addition is considered necessary after the                commencement of the trial having regard to the evidence                that may come before the court.”                                                          (Emphasis supplied)    20     From the above line of precedents, it is clear that Section 216 provides the  court an exclusive and wide-ranging power to change or alter any charge. The  use of the words “at any time before judgment is pronounced” in Sub-Section (1)  empowers the court to exercise its powers of altering or adding charges even  after the completion of evidence, arguments and reserving of the judgment. The  alteration or addition of a charge may be done if in the opinion of the court there 15 (2013) 7 SCC 256  12 was an omission in the framing of charge or if upon prima facie examination of  the material brought on record, it leads the court to form a presumptive opinion as  to the existence of the factual ingredients constituting the alleged offence. The  test to be adopted by the court while deciding upon an addition or alteration of a  charge is that the material brought on record needs to have a direct link or nexus  with the ingredients of the alleged offence. Addition of a charge merely  commences the trial for the additional charges, whereupon, based on the  evidence, it is to be determined whether the accused may be convicted for the  additional charges. The court must exercise its powers under Section 216  judiciously and ensure that no prejudice is caused to the accused and that he is  allowed to have a fair trial. The only constraint on the court’s power is the  prejudice likely to be caused to the accused by the addition or alteration of  charges. Sub-Section (4) accordingly prescribes the approach to be adopted by  the courts where prejudice may be caused.  21     The appellant has relied upon a two-judge Bench decision of this Court in  Onkar Nath Mishra v The State16 to substantiate the point that the ingredients of  Sections 406 and 420 of the IPC have not been established. This Court while  dealing with the nature of evaluation by a court at the stage of framing of charge,  held thus:                 “11. It is trite that at the stage of framing of charge the                court is required to evaluate the material and documents                on record with a view to finding out if the facts emerging                therefrom, taken at their face value, disclosed the                existence of all the ingredients constituting the alleged                offence. At that stage, the court is not expected to go deep                into the probative value of the material on record. What                needs to be considered is whether there is a ground for                presuming that the offence has been committed and not  16 (2008) 2 SCC 561  13              a ground for convicting the accused has been made out.              At that stage, even strong suspicion founded on material              which leads the court to form a presumptive opinion as to the              existence of the factual ingredients constituting the offence              alleged would justify the framing of charge against the              accused in respect of the commission of that offence.”                                                        (Emphasis supplied)    22    In the present case, the High Court while directing the framing the  additional charges has evaluated the material and evidence brought on record  after investigation and held:               “LW1 is the father of the de facto complainant, who states that              his son in law i.e., the first accused promised that he would              look after his daughter at United Kingdom (UK) and promised              to provide Doctor job at UK and claimed Rs.5 lakhs for the              said purpose and received the same and he took his daughter              to the UK. He states that his son-in-law made him believe and              received Rs.5 lakhs in the presence of elders. He states that              he could not mention about the cheating done by his son-in-              law, when he was examined earlier. LW13, who is an              independent witness, also supports the version of LW1 and              states that Rs.5 lakhs were received by A1 with a promise              that he would secure doctor job to the complainant’s              daughter. He states that A1 cheated LW1, stating that he              would provide job and received Rs.5 lakhs. LW14, also is an              independent witness and he supported the version of LW13.              He further states that A1 left his wife and child in India and              went away after receiving Rs.5 lakhs.               Hence, from the above facts, stated by LWs. 13 and 14, prima              facie, the version of LW1 that he gave Rs.5 lakhs to A1 on a              promise that he would provide a job to his daughter and that              A1 did not provide any job and cheated him, receives support              from LWs. 13 and 14. When the amount is entrusted to A1,              with a promise to provide a job and when he fails to              provide the job and does not return the amount, it can be              made out that A1 did not have any intention to provide              job to his wife and that he utilised the amount for a              purpose other than the purpose for which he collected              the amount from LW1, which would suffice to attract the              offences under Sections 406 and 420 IPC. Whether there              is truth in the improved version of LW.1 and what have              been the reasons for his lapse in not stating the same in              his earlier statement, can be adjudicated at the time of              trial.  14             It is also evidence from the record that the additional charge             sheet filed by the investigating officer, missed the attention of             the lower court due to which the additional charges could not             be framed.”                                                         (Emphasis supplied)    23    The test adopted by the High Court is correct and in accordance with  decisions of this Court. In the counter affidavit filed by the fourth respondent  before this Court, depositions of PW 1 (LW 1), PW 5 (LW 12) and PW 6 (LW 13)  and their cross-examination have been annexed. The material on record  supports the possibility that in April 2006, the appellant demanded Rs 5,00,000/-  from PW 1, who is the complainant, in order to secure a doctor’s job for the  complainant’s daughter in the United Kingdom. According to PW 1, he borrowed  the amount from PW 5 (brother-in-law of PW 1) and paid it to the appellant in the  presence of PW 5 and PW 6 (friend of PW 1). Without pronouncing on the  probative value of such evidence, there exists sufficient material on record that  shows a connection or link with the ingredients of the offences under Sections  406 and 420 of the IPC, and the charges sought to be added.   24    The veracity of the depositions made by the witnesses is a question of trial  and need not be determined at the time of framing of charge. Appreciation of  evidence on merit is to be done by the court only after the charges have been  framed and the trial has commenced. However, for the purpose of framing of  charge the court needs to prima facie determine that"

The challenge in the present appeal is to an order passed by the                                High Court of Punjab & Haryana on 27th March, 2014 whereby the                                concurrent findings of fact recorded by both the courts below were                                set aside and the suit filed by the respondent-plaintiff was decreed.                            2.   The High Court has framed the following two substantial questions                                of law:                                      “1.   Whether the Will dated 30.4.1980 Ex.D-3 was                                     surrounded by suspicious circumstances and due                                     execution thereof was also not proved, in accordance with                                     the requirements of Section 63 of the Succession Act; Signature Not Verified  Digitally signed by CHETAN KUMAR Date: 2020.03.19 12:33:58 IST                                     2. Whether the learned courts below have completely                                     misread, misconstrued and misinterpreted the evidence Reason:                                        available on record, particularly the Will Ex.D-3, because                                     of which the impugned judgments cannot be sustained.”                                                                                                      1 3.      The admitted facts are that one Misri was the grandfather of the          Plaintiff-Sheo Ram and defendant No.5-Sohan Lal and defendant          Nos.7-9 were his granddaughters. Chandu Ram was the father of          the plaintiff and defendant Nos.5, 7-9 and the husband of Chand          Kaur had inherited the suit land from his father, Misri.   4.      The plaintiff filed a suit for declaration that he along with his          mother, Chand Kaur and his sisters, defendants Nos. 7-9, were the          owners and in possession of equal shares of the suit land          measuring 489 kanals 4 marlas. He asserted that he belonged to          the Jat community and was governed by Punjab Customary Law.          Further, that his brother, defendant No. 5, got a Will dated 30 th          April, 1980 executed in favour of his sons, from Chandu Ram. Such          a Will contravened Jat Customary Law and was the result of fraud          and      misrepresentation.   Defendant   No.5   and   his   sons,   the          beneficiaries under the Will filed a common written statement and          asserted that the custom had been abrogated after passing of the          Hindu Succession Act, 19561 and that Chandu Ram had separated          all his sons during his life time and given sufficient amount to his          daughters, defendant Nos.7-9, in the shape of dowry and other          ceremonial and customary festivities. In this regard, sufficient land          had also been given to the plaintiff, therefore, there was no Joint          Hindu Family. The Will had been executed by Chandu Ram out of          his natural love and affection and was without any inducement or   1    for short, ‘Act’                                                                                 2      fraud or misrepresentation.   5.   The learned trial court framed as many as 12 issues but for the       purpose of deciding the present appeal, Issue Nos. 1, 3 and 7 are       relevant which read as under:             “1. Whether the plaintiff and the proforma defendants are            the owners and in possession of the property in dispute?                      xx                 xx                 xx             3. Whether the Will dated 30.4.1980 was validly executed            by Chandu Ram in favour of defendants No. 1 to 4?                      xx                 xx                 xx             7. Whether deceased Chandu had separated all his sons            during his life time and had given sufficient amount to his            daughters in the shape of dowry etc. and land to his sons            as alleged in preliminary objection no. 5 of the written            statement? If so to what effect?”   6.   In respect of Issue No. 7 relating to the partition of the property by       Chandu Ram, the defendants relied upon a judgment and decree in       a suit filed by the Plaintiff-Sheo Ram and defendant No.5, Sohan Lal       against their father Chandu Ram. Chandu Ram admitted the fact of       partition and that a judgment (Ex.D-21) and decree (Ex.D-22) to       this effect was passed.          Thereafter, a mutation was also       sanctioned. Chandu Ram had filed a suit for permanent injunction       to the effect that the property in dispute fell to his share while the       defendant (present plaintiff) was given 50 acres of land situated in       Village Gawar, 15½ acres of land in Village Bairan, 10 acres of land       in Village Hariawas and 6 acres of land in Village Baliali, totaling       81½ acres. It was also pleaded that the defendant therein sold 50                                                                             3      acres of land of Village Gawar and 15½ acres of land of Village       Bairan after this partition. The defendant therein asserted that the       properties mentioned above were purchased by him from his       exclusive funds and, therefore, he has right to sell the same. The       certified copy of judgment and decree are Ex. D-17 and D-18.       Therefore, the learned trial court held that Chandu Ram had       separated his sons during his life time and had settled his       daughters as well. Such findings were affirmed by the learned First       Appellate Court.   7.   In respect of Issue No. 3, the learned trial court held that the Will is       duly proved on the basis of statement of DW-3 Maha Singh, an       attesting witness, DW-4 Advocate D.S. Panwar, the scribe, DW-5       Sohan, the defendant and Krishan Kant, Registration Clerk as DW 2.       The Court noticed that DW-4 D.S. Panwar was Chandu Ram’s       advocate in the cases before the Civil Court who had scribed the       Will at his instance and Maha Singh had put his signatures on the       original Will in his presence. DW-4 D.S. Panwar deposed that the       original Will was stated to have been lost and that he was not sure       as to whether Ex. D-3 was the correct photocopy of the original       Will.   Chand Kaur, wife of Chandu Ram was examined as PW-1       who had deposed that Chandu Ram had ousted her from his house.       Therefore, the Court found that it was natural for Chandu Ram to       execute the Will in favour of Defendant No.5, Sohan Lal’s sons. The       Court did not find any merit in the argument that a deviation from       natural succession will make the Will doubtful. It was also held that                                                                              4       the scribe cannot be treated as an attesting witness but that since        two attesting witnesses have signed the Will, the execution of the        Will is proved by examining one of the attesting witnesses. With        the aforesaid findings, the learned trial court dismissed the suit        filed by the plaintiff.   8.    The learned First Appellate Court affirmed the findings recorded by        the trial court and dismissed the suit filed by the plaintiff vide        judgment and decree dated 11th May, 1987. It was held that the        Will had been executed by Chandu Ram in favour of the defendant        Nos. 1 to 4, i.e. the sons of Defendant No.5, Sohan Lal and was not        surrounded by suspicious circumstances.   9.    In second appeal, the learned High Court allowed the appeal filed        by the plaintiff holding that the Will dated 30 th April, 1980 was        surrounded by suspicious circumstances. The substantial question        of law framed by the High Court was only to this effect.    It was        argued by the defendants that the finding that the Will stands        executed and was not surrounded by suspicious circumstances and        has been illegally interfered by the High Court.   10.   The High Court had held that only Maha Singh was examined as        attesting witness as DW-3 whereas the second attesting witness        Azad Singh was not produced, therefore, the Will was not proved. It        also held that the Will had been completely misread, misconstrued        and misinterpreted. The High Court found that in the Will, there        was no mention of Chandu Ram’s wife and the other son i.e. the                                                                          5        Plaintiff, and therefore, such fact was a suspicious circumstance to         doubt the genuineness of the Will. The High Court referred to the         judgment of the trial court dated 7th December, 1981 filed by         Chandu Ram to prove that the house and agricultural land were         ancestral property though no substantial question of law on the         said aspect relating to the nature of land was framed. In fact, the         judgment dated 7th December 1981 (Ex- D-17) in the suit filed by         Chandu Ram, has been produced by the respondent with the         present appeal. A perusal of the judgment shows that Chandu Ram         had asserted partition of the property about 8-10 years back. The         Plaintiff-Sheo Ram had asserted that he is in joint possession of the         property. In the said suit, a decree for permanent injunction was         passed restraining the defendant from interfering with the disputed         property after returning a finding on Issue No. 5 that a family         partition had taken place and that the property cannot be said to         be joint property of the parties. The High Court has not referred to         the findings recorded in the suit filed by the Plaintiff-Sheo Ram.   11.    It may be noticed that in view of Constitution Bench judgment of         this Court in Pankajakshi (D) through LRs & Ors. v. Chandrika         & Ors.2, substantial question of law may not be required to be         framed in Punjab and Haryana but still, the finding of fact recorded         cannot be interfered with even in terms of Section 41 of the Punjab         Courts Act, 1918. The said question was examined by this Court in         Randhir Kaur v. Prithvi Pal Singh and Others3, wherein, the  2     (2016) 6 SCC 157 3     Civil Appeal No. 5822 of 2019 decided on 24th July, 2019                                                                              6       scope for interference in the second appeal under Section 41 of the        Punjab Courts Act applicable in the States of Punjab and Haryana        was delineated and held as under:             “16. A perusal of the aforesaid judgments would show            that the jurisdiction in second appeal is not to interfere            with the findings of fact on the ground that findings are            erroneous, however, gross or inexcusable the error may            seem to be. The findings of fact will also include the            findings on the basis of documentary evidence. The            jurisdiction to interfere in the second appeal is only where            there is an error in law or procedure and not merely an            error on a question of fact.             17. In view of the above, we find that the High Court            could not interfere with the findings of fact recorded after            appreciation of evidence merely because the High Court            thought that another view would be a better view. The            learned first appellate court has considered the absence of            clause in the first power of attorney to purchase land on            behalf of the Plaintiff; the fact that the plaintiff has not            appeared as witness.”    12.   In support of the findings recorded by the High Court, Mr. Manoj        Swarup, learned senior counsel for the plaintiff-respondent argued        that in terms of Section 69 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925, a        Will is required to be attested by two witnesses who have seen the        testator and in which the testator and two of the attesting        witnesses sign in presence of each other. It is argued that Maha        Singh, DW-3 had not deposed that all three were present at the        same time, therefore, the finding of the High Court has to be read        in that context, when the Will was found to be surrounded by        suspicious circumstances as the second attesting witness was not        examined.   It is also argued that the original Will has not been        produced and no application for leading secondary evidence was                                                                            7          filed.     Therefore, the secondary evidence could not be led by the           defendant to prove the execution of the Will.   13.      Section 65(c) of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 4 is applicable in the           facts of the present case as the defendants asserted that the           original Will is lost. The Section 65 reads as under:                    “65.  Cases in which secondary evidence relating to                   documents may be given. – Secondary evidence may be                   given of the existence, condition, or contents of a                   document in the following cases:-                    (a)     xx         xx          xx                    (b)     xx         xx          xx                    (c)     when the original has been destroyed or lost, or                           when the party offering evidence of its contents                           cannot, for any other reason not arising from his                           own default or neglect, produce it in reasonable                           time;                    (d)     xx         xx          xx                    (e)     xx         xx          xx                    (f)     xx         xx          xx                    (g)     xx         xx          xx                    In cases (a), (c) and (d), any secondary evidence of the                   contents of the document is admissible.                            xx         xx          xx”  14.      The defendants produced a certified copy of the Will obtained from           the office of the Sub-Registrar. The defendants also produced the           photocopy of the Will scribed by DW 4- D.S. Panwar.   15.      In a judgment reported as M. Ehtisham Ali for himself and in           place of M. Sakhawat Ali, since deceased v. Jamna Prasad,  4     for short, ‘Evidence Act’                                                                                8          since deceased & Ors.5, the appellants-plaintiffs filed a suit on           the basis of a sale deed. During trial, the stand of the plaintiffs           was that the original sale deed was lost but since it was registered,           secondary evidence by way of a certified copy prepared by the           office of the Registrar was produced. It was not disputed that the           copy produced was not the correct copy of the registered           document. The suit was dismissed for the reason that the plaintiffs           have not succeeded in satisfactorily establishing the loss of the           original sale deed. The Court held as under:                  “It is, no doubt, not very likely that such a deed would be                 lost, but in ordinary cases, if the witness in whose custody                 the deed should be deposed to its loss, unless there is                 some motive suggested for his being untruthful, his                 evidence would be accepted as sufficient to let in                 secondary evidence of the deed. And if in addition he was                 not cross-examined, this result would follow all the more.                 There is no doubt that the deed was executed, for it was                 registered, and registered in a regular way, and it is the                 duty of the registrar, before registering, to examine the                 grantor, or some one whom he is satisfied is the proper                 representative of the grantor, before he allows the deed to                 be registered.”   16.     In another judgment reported as Aher Rama Gova & Ors. v.          State of Gujarat6, the secondary evidence of dying declaration          recorded by a Magistrate was produced in evidence.              This Court          found that though the original dying declaration was not produced          but from the evidence, it is clear that the original was lost and was          not available. The Magistrate himself deposed on oath that he had          given the original dying declaration to the Head Constable whereas   5     AIR 1922 PC 56 6     (1979) 4 SCC 500                                                                                   9       the Head Constable deposed that he had made a copy of the same        and given it back to the Magistrate. Therefore, the Court found that        the   original   dying   declaration   was   not   available   and   the        prosecution was entitled to give secondary evidence which        consisted of the statement of the Magistrate as also of the Head        Constable who had made a copy from the original.               Thus, the        secondary evidence of dying declaration was admitted in evidence,        though no application to lead secondary evidence was filed.   17.   Even though, the aforesaid judgment is in respect of the loss of a        sale deed, the said principle would be applicable in respect of a        Will as well, subject to the proof of the Will in terms of Section 68        of the Evidence Act. In the present case as well, the Will was in        possession of the beneficiary and was stated to be lost. The Will is        dated            30th April, 1980 whereas the testator died on 15th        January, 1982.      There is no cross-examination of any of the        witnesses of the defendants in respect of loss of original Will.        Section 65 of the Evidence Act permits secondary evidence of        existence, condition, or contents of a document including the cases        where the original has been destroyed or lost. The plaintiff had        admitted the execution of the Will though it was alleged to be the        result of fraud and misrepresentation.       The execution of the Will        was not disputed by the plaintiff but only proof of the Will was the        subject matter in the suit.     Therefore, once the evidence of the        defendants is that the original Will was lost and the certified copy        is produced, the defendants have made out sufficient ground for                                                                              10          leading of secondary evidence.   18.      This Court in Bipin Shantilal Panchal v. State of Gujarat &           Anr.7, deprecated the practice in respect of the admissibility of any           material evidence, where the Court does not proceed further           without passing order on such objection.             It was held that all           objections raised shall be decided by the Court at the final stage.           The Court held as under:                  “14. When so recast, the practice which can be a better                 substitute is this: Whenever an objection is raised during                 evidence-taking stage regarding the admissibility of any                 material or item of oral evidence the trial court can make                 a note of such objection and mark the objected document                 tentatively as an exhibit in the case (or record the                 objected part of the oral evidence) subject to such                 objections to be decided at the last stage in the final                 judgment. If the court finds at the final stage that the                 objection so raised is sustainable the Judge or Magistrate                 can keep such evidence excluded from consideration. In                 our view there is no illegality in adopting such a course.                 (However, we make it clear that if the objection relates to                 deficiency of stamp duty of a document the court has to                 decide the objection before proceeding further. For all                 other objections the procedure suggested above can be                 followed).                  15. The above procedure, if followed, will have two                 advantages. First is that the time in the trial court, during                 evidence-taking stage, would not be wasted on account of                 raising such objections and the court can continue to                 examine the witnesses. The witnesses need not wait for                 long hours, if not days. Second is that the superior court,                 when the same objection is recanvassed and reconsidered                 in appeal or revision against the final judgment of the trial                 court, can determine the correctness of the view taken by                 the trial court regarding that objection, without bothering                 to remit the case to the trial court again for fresh disposal.                 We may also point out that this measure would not cause                 any prejudice to the parties to the litigation and would not                 add to their misery or expenses.”    7     (2001) 3 SCC 1                                                                                   11 19.     This Court in Z. Engineers Construction Pvt. Ltd. & Anr. v.          Bipin Bihari Behera & Ors.8, held that even in respect of          deficiency of stamp duty in the State of Orissa where a question          arose as to whether possession had been delivered in pursuance of          a registered power of attorney, the same was a question of fact          which was required to be decided after the evidence was led.   20.     There is no requirement that an application is required to be filed in          terms of Section 65(c) of the Evidence Act before the secondary          evidence is led. A party to the lis may choose to file an application          which is required to be considered by the trial court but if any party          to the suit has laid foundation of leading of secondary evidence,          either in the plaint or in evidence, the secondary evidence cannot          be ousted for consideration only because an application for          permission to lead secondary evidence was not filed.   21.      Now, coming to the question as to whether the defendants have           proved the due execution of the Will, reference will be made to a           judgment     reported    as   H.   Venkatachala       Iyengar     v.   B.N.           Thimmajamma & Ors.9. This Court while considering Section 63           of the Act and Section 68 of the Evidence Act laid down the test as           to whether the testator signed the Will and whether he understood           the nature and effect of the dispositions in the Will. The Court held           as under:                  “18. …Thus the question as to whether the will set up by                 the propounder is proved to be the last will of the testator  8     2020 SCC OnLine SC 184 9     AIR 1959 SC 443                                                                                    12              has to be decided in the light of these provisions. Has the              testator signed the will? Did he understand the nature and              effect of the dispositions in the will? Did he put his              signature to the will knowing what it contained? Stated              broadly it is the decision of these questions which              determines the nature of the finding on the question of              the proof of wills. It would prima facie be true to say that              the will has to be proved like any other document except              as to the special requirements of attestation prescribed              by Section 63 of the Indian Succession Act. As in the case              of proof of other documents so in the case of proof of wills              it would be idle to expect proof with mathematical              certainty. The test to be applied would be the usual test of              the satisfaction of the prudent mind in such matters.”     22.   This Court in a judgment reported as Seth Beni Chand (since        dead) now by LRs. v. Smt. Kamla Kunwar & Ors.10 held that        onus probandi lies in every case upon the party propounding a Will,        and he must satisfy the conscience of the court that the instrument        so propounded is the last will of a free and capable testator. The        Court held as under:               “9. The question which now arises for consideration, on              which the Letters Patent Court differed from the learned              Single Judge of the High Court, is whether the execution of              the will by Jaggo Bai is proved satisfactorily. It is well-              settled that the onus probandi lies in every case upon the              party propounding a will, and he must satisfy the              conscience of the court that the instrument so              propounded is the last will of a free and capable testator. [              See Jarman on Wills (8th Edn., p. 50) and H. Venkatachala              Iyengar v. B.N. Thimmajamma, AIR 1959 SC 443 : 1959              Supp (1) SCR 426] By “free and capable testator” is              generally meant that the testator at the time when he              made the will had a sound and disposing state of mind              and memory. Ordinarily, the burden of proving the due              execution of the will is discharged if the propounder leads              evidence to show that the will bears the signature or mark              of the testator and that the will is duly attested. For              proving attestation, the best evidence would naturally be  10 (1976) 4 SCC 554                                                                               13             of an attesting witness and indeed the will cannot be used             as evidence unless at least one attesting witness,             depending on availability, has been called for proving its             execution as required by Section 68 of the Evidence             Act….”   23.   In view of the aforesaid judgments, at least one of the attesting        witnesses is required to be examined to prove his attestation and        the attestation by another witness and the testator. In the present        case, DW-3 Maha Singh deposed that Chandu Ram had executed        his Will in favour of his four grandsons and he and Azad Singh        signed as witnesses. He deposed that the testator also signed it in        Tehsil office. He and Azad Singh were also witnesses before the        Sub-Registrar.     In the cross-examination, he stated that he had        come to Tehsil office in connection with other documents for        registration.    He deposed that Ex.D-4-the Will, was typed in his        presence. He denied the question that no Will was executed in his        presence. There was no cross-examination about his not being        present before the Sub-Registrar. Once the Will has been proved        then the contents of such document are part of evidence. Thus, the        requirement of Section 63 of the Act and Section 68 of the        Evidence Act stands satisfied.      The witness is not supposed to        repeat in a parrot like manner the language of Section 68 of the        Evidence Act. It is a question of fact in each case as to whether the        witness was present at the time of execution of the Will and        whether the testator and the attesting witnesses have signed in his        presence. The statement of the attesting witness proves the due        execution of the Will apart from the evidence of the scribe and the                                                                           14         official from the Sub-Registrar’s office.   24.     Mr. Swarup referred to judgment of this Court reported as M.L.          Abdul Jabbar Sahib v. M.V. Venkata Sastri & Sons & Ors. 11.          The primary issue discussed therein was a summary suit for          recovery wherein an application for leave to defend was granted on          the condition of furnishing a security for a sum of Rs.50,000/-. The          question examined was whether the security bond is attested by          the two witnesses and, if not, whether it was invalid.                While          considering the attestation, this Court discussed the question of          attestation of witnesses as well and held as under:                    “8. “In every case the Court must be satisfied that the                   names were written animo attestandi”, see Jarman                   on Wills, 8th Edn., p. 137. Evidence is admissible to                   show whether the witness had the intention to attest.                   “The attesting witnesses must subscribe with the                   intention that the subscription made should be complete                   attestation of the will, and evidence is admissible to                   show whether such was the intention or not,”                   see Theobald on Wills, 12th Edn., p. 129. In Girja                   Datt v. Gangotri [AIR 1955 SC 346, 351] , the Court held                   that the two persons who had identified the testator at                   the time of the registration of the will and had appended                   their signatures at the foot of the endorsement by the                   sub-Registrar, were not attesting witnesses as their                   signatures were not put “animo attestandi”. In Abinash                   Chandra Bidvanidhi Bhattacharya v. Dasarath Malo [ILR                   56 Cal 598] it was held that a person who had put his                   name under the word “scribe” was not an attesting                   witness as he had put his signature only for the purpose                   of authenticating that he was a “scribe”. In Shiam                   Sunder Singh v. Jagannath Singh [54 MLJ 43] , the Privy                   Council held that the legatees who had put their                   signatures on the will in token of their consent to its                   execution were not attesting witnesses and were not                   disqualified from taking as legatees.”    11    (1969) 1 SCC 573                                                                                   15 25.   In the aforesaid case, it had been held that the person who put his        name under the word “scribe” was not an attesting witness, further        that the legatees who had put their signatures on the Will were not        attesting witnesses.     In the present case, Maha Singh and Azad        Singh have signed the Will as attesting witnesses not only at the        time of execution but also at the time of registration before the        Sub-Registrar. Therefore, the said judgment is not helpful to the        argument raised.   26.   Mr. Swarup relied on judgment reported as N. Kamalam (Dead) &"

SHAH, J.                            Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned            judgment and order dated 07.09.2018 passed by the High Court            of Gauhati at Itanagar in Criminal Petition No. 36(AP) of 2017, by            which the High Court has dismissed the said criminal petition Signature Not Verified  Digitally signed by ARJUN BISHT Date: 2020.01.31 16:39:59 IST Reason:            preferred by the appellants herein to quash and set aside the                                                                                 1 criminal proceedings being G.R. Case No. 05/200/294, the  original accused nos. 1 & 2 have preferred the present appeal.  2.      That appellant no.1 is the Managing Director of M/s. SPML  Infra    Limited,    previously   known          as   M/s    Subhas   Project  Marketing Limited, and appellant no.2 is the Director of the said  firm M/s SPML Infra Limited.           M/s SPML Infra Limited is a  public limited company incorporated under the Companies Act,  1956.     A contract was entered into between M/s SPML Infra  Limited     and     the   Government        of    Arunachal     Pradesh     on  18.03.1993 for construction, supply and commissioning of the  Nurang Hydel Power Project including three power generating  units for a consideration of Rs.24.96 crores approximately. As  per clause 2(c) of the contract, the defect liability period for the  works was to be for a period of 18 months.                      Project was  commissioned in the month of July, 1996.                     That the defect  liability period for the works of M/s SPML Infra Limited expired  in the month of January, 1998.               That thereafter the project  became      operational    and    started    generating      electricity   and  according to the appellants till 20.09.1998 the project had  generated 90 lakhs KW units. According to the appellants even  the said project is also in operation today.                There were some                                                                               2 disputes with respect to the payment of maintenance by the  respondents. The appellants issued notice to the respondents to  take over the project before 31.03.2000 on account of non­  payment of maintenance, vide notice dated 09.03.2000.  2.1   That thereafter the respondents – original complainant  lodged the complaint against the appellants and others being  Jang PS Case No. 05/2000 for the offence under Section 420 of  the IPC alleging inter alia that the appellants provided inferior  quality materials in contravention with the provisions of the  contract which stipulated specific percentages of nickel and  chromium to be used. It was alleged in the complaint that the  appellants were required to supply the equipments as per the  terms of the contract. As per the complaint, in course of physical  inspection of the plant, the DOP found that three runners  turbines, viz, turbine nos. 1, 2 and 3 were cracked and damaged.  Therefore, the damaged components were sent for testing and the  National Test House, Calcutta submitted its report and it was  found that the chemical composition of the broken runner was  found containing 5.28% Nickel and 7.5% Chromium, which  composition was contrary to the specification as per the  agreement.   Therefore, it was alleged that M/s SPML, Calcutta                                                                   3 had supplied sub­standard turbines containing composition of  materials not in accordance with the specification of MOU,  resulted in frequent damage of runner turbine buckets. On the  strength of written complaint, an FIR was lodged/registered. It  appears that during the course of the investigation, the  Investigating        Officer        found/discovered          the  illegalities/irregularities in awarding the contract at a higher  price. Even during the course of investigation, the Investigating  Officer found some officials responsible for the omission and  neglect of duties and it was found that the officials named in the  charge sheet were involved/connived with the firm M/s SPML  Infra Limited with a view to cheat the Government of Arunachal  Pradesh. After conclusion of the investigation, the Investigating  Officer filed the final report/chargesheet 28.05.2004 against the  appellants and others for the offences under Section 120­B and  420 of the IPC. 2.2 According to the appellants, they were not  aware about the filing of the FIR and the chargesheet against  them till the year 2017 and on being aware of the FIR and the  chargesheet against them, the appellants preferred a petition  before the High Court for quashing the aforesaid criminal  proceedings under Section 482 Cr.P.C.      It was contended on                                                                   4 behalf of the appellants that the matter pertains to the contract  and therefore purely a civil and contractual dispute has been  given the colour of criminality and that too with a mala fide  intention as they served a notice upon the respondents to pay the  maintenance amount due and payable. It was also submitted on  behalf   of   the   appellants   that   they   are   the   Managing  Director/Director of M/s SPML Infra Limited – a company and  that the company has not been arrayed as an accused. It was  submitted that there are no allegations that the appellants were  in­charge of the affairs of the company and therefore vicariously  liable. Number of other submissions were also made on merits in  support of their submission that the offence under Section 420  IPC has not been made out at all. It was also submitted that as  soon as the company/appellants were informed with respect to  the defect, despite the defect liability period was over, they  changed the turbines in the year 2000. It was also submitted  that all through out the project has run and even still running.  2.3   That by the impugned judgment and order, the High Court  has refused to quash the criminal proceedings. While rejecting  the quashing petition, the High Court has observed that there are  allegations not only against the appellants, but also against the                                                                     5 connected company executives and engineers of the Government  of Arunachal Pradesh and there are allegations of criminal  conspiracy amongst themselves in the supply of sub­standard  runner turbines and receiving the sub­standard runner turbines  which were not in conformity with the specified standard and the  others co­accused persons have not come up with a similar  petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C. and therefore at this stage it is  not possible to segregate the case qua the appellants only.  2.4   Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned  judgment and order passed by the High Court in refusing to  quash the criminal proceedings against the appellants in exercise  of powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C., the original accused nos. 1  & 2 – Managing Director/Director of M/s. SPML Infra Limited  have preferred the present appeal.  3.    Shri Harin P. Raval, learned Senior Advocate appearing on  behalf of the appellants has vehemently submitted that in the  facts and circumstances of the case the High Court has  committed a grave error in not exercising the power under  Section 482 Cr.P.C and not quashing the criminal proceedings.  3.1   It is further submitted by Shri Raval, learned Senior  Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellants that the High                                                                     6 Court has failed to appreciate and consider the fact that by the  impugned criminal proceedings the complainant has tried to  convert purely a civil dispute into a criminal case.  3.2   It is further submitted by Shri Raval, learned Senior  Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellants that the High  Court has failed to consider and appreciate that the allegations  as contained in the FIR even if taken on face value and assumed  to be correct in entirety,       do not disclose a prima facie  commission of an offence, much less a cognizable offence.  3.3   It is further submitted by Shri Raval, learned Senior  Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellants that a bare  perusal of the FIR would demonstrate that the allegations seem  to be supply of inferior quality of raw materials as seen under  test report of National Test House, Calcutta which purportedly  does not match with the test certificate given by the company. It  is submitted that there is nothing in the entire body of FIR to  suggest even remotely the element of existence of fraudulent and  dishonest intention from the initiation of the transaction between  the parties.  3.4   It is further submitted by Shri Raval, learned Senior  Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellants that the High                                                                   7 Court has not properly appreciated and considered the fact that  the defect liability period expired much before the filing of the  complaint/FIR.  3.5   It is further submitted by Shri Raval, learned Senior  Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellants that even  thereafter also the company continued the maintenance work  and the project is running. It is submitted that in fact the project  was commissioned in the year 1996 and the project had  generated 90 lakhs KW units till 20.09.1998 even as per the  certificate issued by the Department of Power.  3.6   It is further submitted by Shri Raval, learned Senior  Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellants that the High  Court has failed to appreciate the fact that the impugned FIR and  the complaint subsequently filed has been filed with a mala fide  intention and after the company demanded to pay the amount for  regular maintenance work.  3.7   It is further submitted by Shri Raval, learned Senior  Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellants that the High  Court ought to have appreciated that the FIR was lodged on  26.06.2000 only after the appellants issued notice dated  9.3.2000 by which the complainant was called upon to take over                                                                     8 the project before 31.03.2000 on account of non­payment of the  maintenance charges.  3.8   It is further submitted by Shri Raval, learned Senior  Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellants that the High  Court has failed to appreciate and consider the fact that the  disputes between the parties were pending before the arbitrators.  It is submitted that in fact the company was required to initiate  the arbitration proceedings on account of being denied the  legitimate due payments.  3.9   It is further submitted by Shri Raval, learned Senior  Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellants that looking to the  averments and the allegations in the complaint/FIR, it cannot be  said that ingredients for committing the offence under Section  420 IPC has been made out. It is submitted that there are no  allegations in the FIR that the appellants acted in dishonest and  fraudulent intention from the very inception of the contract with  the respondent – State.  3.10 It is further submitted by Shri Raval, learned Senior  Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellants that the  allegations as contained in the FIR at best pointed towards the  dispute, namely, relating to breach of the conditions of the                                                                   9 contract and therefore at best could have given rise to civil  liability.  3.11 It is further submitted by Shri Raval, learned Senior  Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellants that the High  Court has failed to appreciate that no complaint has been filed  against the company – M/s SPML Infra Limited and only the  appellants being the Managing Director/Director of M/s SPML  Infra Limited are joined as accused. It is submitted that as held  by this Court in catena of decisions in the absence of the main  company being joined as accused the criminal proceedings  against the Directors of the company alone shall not be  maintainable.  3.12 It is further submitted by Shri Raval, learned Senior  Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellants that even  otherwise there are no averments and allegations in the  complaint    that        the    appellants   were    in   charge   of    the  administration      of    the    company     and    therefore   they    were  vicariously liable for the act of the company.  3.13 It is further submitted by Shri Raval, learned Senior  Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellants that the High  Court has failed to appreciate that apart from the fact that defect                                                                            10 liability period had expired in the year 1998 and even thereafter  the certificates were issued by the Chief Engineer certifying  satisfaction   over   the   execution   of   the   project   and     its  commissioning in July, 1996, the defects subsequently detected  were cured even after the defect period was over and even the  company changed the turbines. It is submitted that therefore if  the intention of the company and/or the appellants was to cheat,  in that case, they would not have changed/replaced the runner  buckets.  3.14 It is further submitted by Shri Raval, learned Senior  Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellants that the High  Court has not properly appreciated and considered the role of the  appellants and their company in the entire contract.               It is  submitted that the entire contract was not to manufacture the  turbines and the runner buckets by the appellants and the  company, but to only procure the same from the manufacturer  and supply the same to the respondents. It is submitted that the  company relied upon the certificate issued by the manufacturer  and simply used the said turbines in the project. It is submitted  that therefore also the appellants cannot be saddled with the                                                                         11 criminal liability for any manufacturing defect when the same  was not even in the domain of the appellants and their company.  3.15 It is further submitted by Shri Raval, learned Senior  Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellants that even  otherwise   when   the   final   report   has   been   filed   by   the  investigating officer, the chargesheet has gone much beyond the  allegations and averments in the FIR.  3.16 It is further submitted by Shri Raval, learned Senior  Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellants that though there  were no allegations in the complaint/FIR, the police authorities  went into the commercial efficacy of the project through which  M/s SPML Infra Limited was selected. It is submitted that merely  because there was a margin difference between the purported  manufacturing cost of the turbines and the rates quoted by the  company, the appellants cannot be held guilty of a criminal  offence of cheating. It is submitted that as such the company  was the lowest bidder and was awarded the contract after due  deliberations by the tendering committee.  3.17 It is further submitted by Shri Raval, learned Senior  Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellants that the High                                                                         12 Court has failed to exercise the powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C.  and thus has not exercised the jurisdiction vested in it.  3.18 Making the above submissions and relying upon the  decisions of this Court in the cases of State of Haryana v. Bhajan  Lal 1992 Supp. (1) SCC 335; Hira Lal Hari Lal Bhagwati v. CBI,  New Delhi (2003) 5 SCC 257; Indian Oil Corporation v. NEPC India  Limited and others (2006) 6 SCC 736; V.V. Jose and another v.  State of Gujarat and another (2009) 3 SCC 78; Vesa Holdings  Private Limited v. State of Kerala and others (2015) 8 SCC 293;  and Sharad Kumar Sanghi v. Sangita Rane (2015) 12 SCC 781, it  is prayed to allow the present appeal and quash and set aside the  impugned criminal proceedings so far as the appellants are  concerned.  4.    The present appeal is vehemently opposed by the learned  counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents – State of  Arunachal Pradesh.  4.1   It is vehemently submitted by the learned counsel appearing  on behalf of the respondent – State and the counsel on behalf of  the original complainant that having found a prima facie case for  the offence under Section 420 IPC for delivering/supplying sub­                                                                    13 standard materials and charging exorbitant rates for such  materials with a criminal intent to dupe the Government with  huge public money, the High Court has rightly refused to quash  the criminal proceedings.  4.2   It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on  behalf of the respondents that the appellants are charged for the  offences under Section 420 read with 120B IPC. It is submitted  that as per the inspection carried out by the Department and  even as revealed during the investigation the appellants supplied  the sub­standard runner turbines which are used by the accused  though they were not in conformity with the specified standards.  It is submitted that therefore a prima facie case of criminal  conspiracy between the accused to cheat the government has  been made out.  4.3   It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on  behalf   of   the   respondents    that   there    being   enough  material/evidences against the appellants and therefore this is a  fit case wherein the appellants are liable to be prosecuted for the  commission of an offence under Section 420, 120B IPC.  4.4   It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on  behalf of the respondents that the arbitration proceedings                                                                   14 initiated by the appellants/company has nothing to do with the  criminal dispute. It is submitted that therefore it cannot be said  that the civil dispute is tried to be converted into a criminal  dispute.  4.5   It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on  behalf of the respondents that even otherwise as held by this  Court in catena of decisions just because a proceeding has a civil  nature does not mean that no criminality exists in the same.  4.6   It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on  behalf of the respondents that during the course of investigation  it has been found that one Kartik Steel Limited, Chennai tested  the components supplied by M/s SPML Infra Limited and the  report suggests that the materials were sub­standard.          It is  submitted that therefore it is a clear cut case that the appellants  had prior knowledge of the low quality of the materials which  they supplied to the department.  4.7   It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on  behalf of the respondents that during the course of investigation,  it is found that the appellants have not only cheated the DOP by  supplying   sub­standard    materials   but   they   also   charged  exorbitant rates for the three runner buckets turbines in spite of                                                                   15 their knowledge that the said runner buckets were not up to the  satisfaction. It is submitted that during the investigation it has  come on record that the turbines were manufactured by M/s  Beacon Neyrpic, Chennai and the rates quoted by the appellants  and the manufacturing company were compared. It is submitted  that it has been found that cost as per the manufacturing  company was Rs.1,61,04,000/­, however, M/s SPML Infra  Limited charged Rs.5,18,50,049/­. Thus, there was a difference  in the rate to the tune of Rs.3,57,46,049/­. It is submitted that  therefore there was a fraudulent and dishonest intention from  the initiation of the transaction between the parties.  4.8    It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on  behalf of the respondents that thus the supply of sub­standard  material at three times higher rates and the prior knowledge of  the sub­standard quality of the material shows that the  appellants had criminal intent to supply sub­standard quality  material at a higher price to the DOP/Government of Arunachal  Pradesh. It is submitted that therefore the appellants are rightly  chargesheeted for the offence under Section 420 read with 120B  IPC.                                                                    16 4.9   It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on  behalf of the respondents that appellant no.1 is the Managing  Director and appellant no.2 is the Director of the company – M/s  SPML     Infra    Limited    and    therefore    being    Managing  Director/Director of the company, naturally they were in charge  of the administration and management of the company and  therefore are vicariously liable. It is submitted that the aforesaid  has been elaborately considered by the High Court in the  impugned judgment and order.           It is submitted that even  otherwise as rightly observed by the High Court at this stage it is  not possible to segregate only the appellants case.  4.10 It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on  behalf of the respondents that whatever submissions are made  on behalf of the appellants are their defences which are required  to be considered at the time of the trial. It is submitted that after  thorough investigation, the investigating agency has filed the  chargesheet against the appellants and other accused for the  offences under Section 420 read with 120B IPC and more  particularly with respect to criminal conspiracy, the High Court  has rightly refused to quash the criminal proceedings in exercise  of powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C., which powers are required                                                                     17 to be exercised sparingly and in exceptional cases, as observed by  this Court in catena of decisions.  4.11 Making the above submissions and relying upon the  decision of this Court in the case of         Sau. Kamal Shivaji  Pokarnekar v. The State of Maharashtra and others, reported in  2019 SCC Online SC 182 (Criminal Appeal No.255 of 2019  decided on 12.02.2019), it is prayed to dismiss the present  appeal.  5.    We have heard the learned counsel for the respective parties  at length. We have also gone through and considered the  averments and allegations in the FIR as well as the charge sheet  filed by the investigating agency.  5.1   At the outset, it is required to be noted that the chargesheet  has been filed against the appellants for the offences under  Section 420 read with Section 120B of the IPC. By the impugned  judgment and order, the High Court has refused to quash the FIR  and the chargesheet against the appellants in exercise of powers  under Section 482 Cr.P.C.. Therefore, the short question which  is posed for the consideration of this Court is, whether a case has  been made out to quash the FIR and the chargesheet against the                                                                      18 appellants for the offences under Section 420 read with Section  120B of the IPC, in exercise of powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C?  6.   Considering the averments and the allegations in the FIR  and even the chargesheet the main allegations are that the  company, namely, M/s SPML Infra Limited supplied sub­  standard materials – runner bucket turbines and the supplied  runner   bucket     turbines   were   not   as   per    the   technical  specifications.    It is also required to be noted that there is no  FIR/complaint/chargesheet against the company – M/s SPML  Infra Limited and the appellants are arrayed as an accused as  Managing Director and Director of M/s SPML Infra Limited  respectively.     From a bare reading of the FIR and even the  chargesheet, there are no allegations that there was a fraudulent  and dishonest intention to cheat the government from the very  beginning of the transaction.         Even there are no specific  allegations and averments in the FIR/chargesheet that the  appellants were in­charge of administration and management of  the company and thereby vicariously liable.            In light of the  aforesaid, the prayer of the appellants to quash the criminal  proceedings against the appellants for the offence under Section  420 IPC is required to be considered.                                                                       19 7.    While considering the prayer of the appellants to quash the  impugned criminal proceedings against the appellants for the  offence under Section 420 IPC, few decisions of this Court on  exercise of powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C. are required to be  referred to.  7.1   In the case of Bhajan Lal (supra), in paragraph 102, this  Court has categorised the cases by way of illustration wherein  the powers under Article 226 or the inherent powers under  Section 482 Cr.P.C. could be exercised either to prevent the  abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends  of justice. In paragraph 102, it is observed and held as under:               “102. In the backdrop of the interpretation of the various       relevant provisions of the Code under Chapter XIV and of the       principles of law enunciated by this Court in a series of       decisions relating to the exercise of the extraordinary power       under Article 226 or the inherent powers under Section 482 of       the Code which we have extracted and reproduced above, we       give the following categories of cases by way of illustration       wherein such power could be exercised either to prevent abuse       of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of       justice, though it may not be possible to lay down any precise,       clearly defined and sufficiently channelised and inflexible       guidelines or rigid formulae and to give an exhaustive list of       myriad kinds of cases wherein such power should be exercised.              (1) Where the allegations made in the first information                     report or the complaint, even if they are taken at                     their face value and accepted in their entirety do                     not prima facie constitute any offence or make out                     a case against the accused.              (2) Where the allegations in the first information report                     and other materials, if any, accompanying the FIR                     do not disclose a cognizable offence, justifying an                     investigation by police officers under Section 156(1)                                                                              20                    of the Code except under an order of a Magistrate                    within the purview of Section 155(2) of the Code.            (3)    Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the                    FIR or complaint and the evidence collected in                    support of the same do not disclose the                    commission of any offence and make out a case                    against the accused.            (4)   Where, the allegations in the FIR do not constitute a                    cognizable offence but constitute only a non­                    cognizable offence, no investigation is permitted by                    a police officer without an order of a Magistrate as                    contemplated under Section 155(2) of the Code.            (5)   Where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint                    are so absurd and inherently improbable on the                    basis of which no prudent person can ever reach a                    just conclusion that there is sufficient ground for                    proceeding against the accused.            (6)    Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any                    of the provisions of the Code or the concerned Act                    (under which a criminal proceeding is instituted) to                    the institution and continuance of the proceedings                    and/or where there is a specific provision in the                    Code or the concerned Act, providing efficacious                    redress for the grievance of the aggrieved party.            (7)   Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended                    with mala fide and/or where the proceeding is                    maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for                    wreaking vengeance on the accused and with a                    view to spite him due to private and personal                    grudge.”          The aforesaid decision of this Court has been followed  subsequently by this Court in catena of decisions.  7.2   In the case of Vesa Holdings Private Limited (supra), it is  observed and held by this Court that every breach of contract  would not give rise to an offence of cheating and only in those  cases breach of contract would amount to cheating where there  was any deception played at the very inception.               It is further                                                                            21 observed and held that for the purpose of constituting an offence  of cheating, the complainant is required to show that the accused  had fraudulent or dishonest intention at the time of making  promise or representation. It is further observed and held that  even in a case where allegations are made in regard to failure on  the part of the accused to keep his promise, in the absence of a  culpable intention at the time of making initial promise being  absent, no offence under Section 420 IPC can be said to have  been made out. It is further observed and held that the real test  is whether the allegations in the complaint disclose the criminal  offence of cheating or not.  7.3   In the case of Hira Lal Hari Lal Bhagwati (supra), in  paragraph 40, this Court has observed and held as under:               “40. It is settled law, by a catena of decisions, that for       establishing the offence of cheating, the complainant is required       to show that the accused had fraudulent or dishonest intention       at the time of making promise or representation. From his       making failure to keep promise subsequently, such a culpable       intention right at the beginning that is at the time when the       promise was made cannot be presumed. It is seen from the       records that the exemption certificate contained necessary       conditions which were required to be complied with after       importation of the machine. Since the GCS could not comply       with it       , therefore, it rightly paid the necessary duties       without taking advantage of the exemption certificate. The       conduct of the GCS clearly indicates that there was no       fraudulent or dishonest intention of either the GCS or the       appellants in their capacities as office­bearers right at the time       of making application for exemption. As there was absence of       dishonest and fraudulent intention, the question of committing                                                                              22       offence under Section 420 of the Penal Code, 1860 does not       arise.

The main issue which arises for decision is as follows:   “Whether a writ of habeas corpus would lie, for securing release  of a person who is undergoing a sentence of imprisonment  imposed by court of competent jurisdiction praying that he be  released in terms of some Government orders / Rules providing  for pre­mature release of prisoners?”   4.      At the outset, we may mention that on 17.10.2019 we had  framed two issues.       We have reframed the first issue and on  closer examination we are of the view that the second issue does  not arise for decision in this case.   5.      The Governor of Tamil Nadu exercising powers under  Article 161 of the Constitution of India got issued G.O.(Ms.)  No.64    dated   01.02.2018     through   the   Home    (Prison­IV)  Department, Government of Tamil Nadu wherein a Scheme was  framed for considering the cases of pre­mature release of  convicted prisoners on the occasion of the Birth Centenary of  Shri M.G. Ramachandran, former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu.  The relevant portion of the Scheme reads as follows:­                                      2        “5.    The Government after careful examination have decided               to frame the following guidelines for considering the cases               of life convict prisoners for releasing them prematurely               under Article 161 of the Constitution of India, in               commemoration of the Birthday Centenary of ‘Bharat               Ratna’, Puratchi Thalaivar Dr. M. G. Ramachandran,               former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, based on the               announcement of Hon’ble Chief Minister:­                (I) The following committees are constituted for               examining the premature release of the life convict               prisoners, case to case basis, on the above lines.                  (i) the State level committee headed by the Inspector               General of Prisons and the Deputy Inspector General of               Prisons (Hqrs), Legal officer, Administrative officer (Hqrs)               shall be members of the committee.                  (ii) the Second level/District committee wherein the               Central Prisons/Special Prisons for Women located,               headed by the Superintendent of Prisons of the               concerned    Central    Prison   and    the    Additional               Superintendent of Prison, Jailor, Administrative Officer               and Probation Officer shall be members of the committee.                  (iii) the concerned Range Deputy Inspector General of               Prisons and Regional Probation officer of the concerned               region shall examine the proposal of the second level               committee and send the same to State Level committee               along with recommendation.                       xxx                 xxx                  xxx     6.    Under the Scheme, a State level committee and District  committees were constituted.            The District committees were to  consider     the    cases     of    the      prisoners     and      send     their                                            3 recommendations to the Range Deputy Inspector General of  Prisons and Regional Probation Officer who, after examination of  the same, were to send the same to the State level committee  along with the recommendations. The Scheme further provided  as follows:­           (II) The life convicts who have completed 10 years of actual               imprisonment as on 25.02.2018 and the life convicts who               are aged 60 years and above and who have completed 5               years of actual imprisonment on 25.02.2018 including               those who were originally sentenced to death by the Trial               Court and modified to life sentence by the Appellate               Court (other than those whose convictions have been               commuted), may be considered for premature release               subject to satisfaction of the following conditions:­               1) The prisoner’s behaviour should be satisfactory.             2) Prisoners convicted for the following offences are            ineligible for consideration for premature release            irrespective of the nature and tenure of the sentence            and irrespective of the fact as to whether or not they            have undergone the sentence in respect of the said            offence namely:”  Thereafter, the Scheme provides that prisoners convicted for  certain offences or for offences under certain Acts would not be  eligible for benefit under the Scheme.                 The Scheme also lays  down the following amongst other conditions:­             4) That there is safety for the prisoner’s life, if released.             5) That the prisoner will be accepted by the members of            their family.             6) That there is safety of life of the family which was            affected by the prisoner, if released.                                            4                  xxx                xxx          xxx                8) The life imprisonment prisoners cannot claim premature            release as a matter of right.”    7.     As far as the present cases are concerned, the detenus  whose release were sought were convicted for various offences  including the offences under Section 302 of the Indian Penal  Code, 1860. In all cases, they have been sentenced for life and  their conviction and sentences have been upheld till this Court.  The petitions for habeas corpus were filed on the ground that the  State has not given benefit of the premature release referred to  above to the petitioners whereas many others have been given the  benefit.   8.     In all the cases representations were made by the  petitioners a few months before filing the petitions in the High  Court praying that they be released in terms of G.O.(Ms) No.64  dated 01.02.2018. These representations were pending but the  High Court in almost identical terms has held in all the cases  that “There is no dispute over the fact that the convict prisoner  would be entitled to release under G.O.(Ms). No.64, Home [Prison­  IV] Department dated 01.02.2018. However, he has been denied                                      5 the benefit thereof, since the Probation Officer’s report informs  danger to the life of the Convicts Prisoner, if he be let at large.”  Thereafter, the High Court was of the opinion that the detenu  could not be denied release on the ground that life of the detenu  was in danger. However, it directed that the detenu be informed  that his life may be in danger while releasing him.      In all the  cases, reference has been made to the report of the Probation  Officer. These petitions have been allowed by the High Court of  Madras and allowing the writ of habeas corpus, the detenus have  been ordered to be released forthwith in terms of G.O.(Ms) No. 64  dated 01.02.2018 unless their presence is required in any other  case.   9.      These orders are under challenge before us.          We have  heard Shri Mukul Rohatgi and Shri V. Giri, learned senior  counsel for the appellants, Shri Yogesh Kanna, learned counsel  for the State of Tamil Nadu and Shri S. Nagamuthu and Shri  Ratnakar    Dash,   learned   senior   counsel   for   the    private  respondents.   10.     It has been urged on behalf of the State that the High  Court has transgressed the jurisdiction conferred upon it under                                    6 Article 226 of the Constitution of India while issuing the writ of  habeas corpus.      It is contended that in all the cases the  petitioners were convicted of the offences of murder which  conviction was upheld till this Court and, therefore, by no stretch  of imagination, can it be urged that the detention of the detenus  was illegal.   It is further submitted that the High Court could  have at best directed consideration of the cases of the detenus by  the authorities under the G.O.(Ms) No.64 dated 01.02.2018 but  could not itself have directed release of the detenus. It is also  submitted that the High Court has only noted one portion of the  report of the Probation Officer and ignored many other relevant  considerations.   11.    On the other hand, it is contended by learned senior  counsel appearing on behalf of the detenus that the High Court  of Madras has passed hundreds of orders of this nature but the  State has selectively chosen to challenge only a few of them. As  far as jurisdiction is concerned, it is submitted by learned senior  counsel for the detenus that in terms of the Rules to Regulate the  Proceedings under Article 226 of the Constitution of India framed  by the High Court of Madras, the writs of this type are described                                    7 as habeas corpus writs and a writ of this nature would not be  entertained unless it is described as a writ of habeas corpus  under the Rules. It is further submitted that a writ of habeas  corpus    would lie in such circumstances and it is also urged that  in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, this Court  should not interfere with the discretion exercised by the High  Court.      It was lastly urged by learned senior counsel for the  detenus that the prisoners have been behind the bars for a very  long period of time and even under the normal rules of remission,  they would be entitled to be released. It has also been urged that  many other detenus who were similarly situate have already been  released.    He has brought to our notice a number of orders  passed by this Court in this regard. We may note that in many of  these orders this Court has not approved of the manner in which  the Madras High Court has ordered the release of prisoners but  has upheld the order of release on account of the long  incarceration of the detenu.   12.      We feel that a quietus has to be given to this matter and  the legal issue must be decided.       As far as the objection of  selective filing of petitions by the State against orders of release                                    8 by the High Court is concerned, that objection is meaningless.  We are not aware of the other orders and, in any event, there can  be no claim of negative discrimination under Article 14 of the  Constitution of India.   13.    Article 226 of the Constitution of India empowers the High  Courts to issue certain writs including writs in the nature of  habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto and  certiorari for the enforcement of any right conferred under Part III  of the Constitution dealing with the fundamental rights. In this  case, we are concerned with the scope and ambit of the  jurisdiction of the High Court while dealing with the writ of  habeas corpus.   14.    It is a settled principle of law that a writ of habeas corpus  is available as a remedy in all cases where a person is deprived of  his/her personal liberty. It is processual writ to secure liberty of  the citizen from unlawful or unjustified detention whether a  person is detained by the State or is in private detention.      As  Justice Hidayatullah (as he then was) held; “The writ of habeas  corpus issues not only for release from detention by the State but                                      9 also for release from private detention” 1. At the same time, the  law is well established that a writ of habeas corpus will not lie  and such a prayer should be rejected by the Court where  detention or imprisonment of the person whose release is sought  is in accordance with the decision rendered by a court of law or  by an authority in accordance with law.   15.       According to Dicey, ­“if, in short, any man, woman, or  child is, or is asserted on apparently good grounds to be,  deprived of liberty, the Court will always issue a writ of habeas  corpus to anyone who has the aggrieved person in his custody to  have such person brought before the Court, and if he is suffering  restraint without lawful cause, set him free.”2   16.       In Halsburry’s Laws of England, a writ of habeas corpus is  described as “a remedy available to the lowliest subject against  the most powerful.”3 It is a writ of such a sovereign and  transcendent authority that no privilege of person or place can  stand against it4.    1 Mohd. Ikram v. State of U.P., AIR 1964 SC 1625 2 A.V. Dicey, Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution, Macmillan And Co., Limited, p. 215 (1915) 3 Halsbury’s Laws of England, (4th Edn.) Vol. 11, para 1454 p. 769 4 V.G. Ramachandran’s Law of Writs, revised by Justice C.K. Thakker & M.C. Thakker, Eastern Book Company, , p.1036, 6th Edn. (2006)                                              10 17.    A writ of habeas corpus can only be issued when the  detention or confinement of a person is without the authority of  law.   Though the literal meaning of the Latin phrase habeas  corpus is ‘to produce the body’, over a period of time production  of the body is more often than not insisted upon but legally it is  to be decided whether the body is under illegal detention or not.  Habeas corpus is often used as a remedy in cases of preventive  detention because in such cases the validity of the order  detaining the detenu is not subject to challenge in any other  court and it is only writ jurisdiction which is available to the  aggrieved party. The scope of the petition of habeas corpus has  over a period of time been expanded and this writ is commonly  used when a spouse claims that his/her spouse has been illegally  detained by the parents. This writ is many times used even in  cases of custody of children. Even though, the scope may have  expanded, there are certain limitations to this writ and the most  basic of such limitation is that the Court, before issuing any writ  of habeas corpus must come to the conclusion that the detenu is  under detention without any authority of law.                                     11 18.      In these cases, the detenus have been sentenced to  imprisonment for life and as such their detention cannot be said  to be illegal.       It is not for the writ court to decide whether a  prisoner is entitled to parole or remission and these matters lie  squarely in the domain of the Government.   19.      Reliance has been placed by learned senior counsel for  the detenus on the judgment of this Court in the case of Sunil  Batra (II) v. Delhi Administration5, wherein Justice Krishna  Iyer in his inimitable style has dealt with the expanding scope of  habeas corpus jurisdiction. However, before referring to his views  on the scope of habeas corpus, one has to refer to the factual  situation which led to the filing of the case. Sunil Batra came to  know that some other prisoners were being tortured by the Head  Warder Jail Superintendent to extract money from the visiting  relatives.    He brought this to the notice of this Court and this  Court     entertained      his   petition   under   Article   32   of   the  Constitution holding that ‘‘these proceedings which, though not  strictly traditional, are clearly in the nature of habeas corpus writs  and, therefore, within the widest sweep of Article 32’’. The Court  dealt with the very sensitive issue of the manner in which 5 (1980) 3 SCC 488                                        12 prisoners in jail were deprived of their basic human rights and it  is in this context that the Court held as follows:­              “5….Prison houses are part of Indian earth and the Indian         Constitution cannot be held at bay by jail officials ‘dressed in a         little, brief authority’, when Part III is invoked by a convict.         For when a prisoner is traumatized, the Constitution suffers a         shock. And when the court takes cognizance of such violence         and violation, it does, like the Hound of Heaven, ‘But with         unhurrying chase, and unperturbed pace, Deliberate speed         and Majestic instancy’ follow the official offender and frown         down the outlaw adventure.”    20.    This Court referred to the development of law in the  United States of America and held that the writ in the nature of  habeas corpus could be issued going beyond the conventional  blinkers and the Court must examine the manner in which the  inmate is held and treated during the currency of a sentence.  One must remember that any person can be deprived of his  liberty only in accordance with the procedure established by law.  Therefore, when a person is sent to prison; whether during the  investigation under an order of remand, issued under Section  167 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,1973, or as an undertrial  by denying him the facility of bail, or after conviction; he is  behind bars because of the orders of the Court. The Court which  deprives a person of his liberty in accordance with law also has  the responsibility to ensure that such a person though under                                         13 incarceration is not denied the other fundamental rights which  he is entitled to.     Therefore, there can be no dispute with the  proposition that anybody who is behind bars and is ill­treated or  is deprived of his liberties, may approach the Court for a writ of  habeas corpus. In the apposite words of Justice Krishna Iyer:­           “26. Where injustice, verging on inhumanity, emerges from         hacking human rights guaranteed in Part III and the victim         beseeches the court to intervene and relieve, this Court will be         a functional futility as a constitutional instrumentality if its         guns do not go into action until the wrong is righted. The court         is not a distant abstraction omnipotent in the books but an         activist institution which is the cynosure of public hope. We         hold that the court can issue writs to meet the new challenges.         Lord Scarman’s similar admonition, in his ENGLISH LAW —         THE NEW DIMENSIONS, is an encouraging omen. The         objection, if any, is obsolete because in a prison situation, a         Constitution Bench of this Court [Sunil Batra v. Delhi Admn.,         (1978) 4 SCC 494 and Sobraj (1978) 4 SCC 494] did imprison         the powers of prison officials, to put an under trial under iron         fetters or confine in solitary cells convicts with death sentences         under appeal.          27. Once jurisdiction is granted — and we affirm in         unmistakable terms that the court has, under Article 32 and         so too under Article 226, a clear power and, therefore, a public         duty to give relief to sentences in prison settings — the next         question is the jurisprudential backing for the play of that         jurisdiction. Here again, Sunil Batra v. Delhi Admn., (1978) 4         SCC 494 has blazed a trail, and it binds.          28. Are prisoners persons? Yes, of course. To answer in the         negative is to convict the nation and the Constitution of         dehumanization and to repudiate the world legal order, which         now recognises rights of prisoners in the International         Covenant on Prisoners’ Rights to which our country has signed         assent. In Sunil Batra v. Delhi Admn., (1978) 4 SCC 494, this         Court has rejected the hands­off doctrine and it has been         ruled that fundamental rights do not flee the person as he         enters the prison although they may suffer shrinkage         necessitated by incarceration. Our constitutional culture has         now crystallised in favour of prison justice and judicial         jurisdiction : (SCC p. 504, para 4)                                           14                “The jurisdictional reach and range of this Court’s writ to                hold prison caprice and cruelty in constitutional leash is                incontestable, but teasing intrusion into administrative                discretion is legal anathema, absent breaches of                constitutional rights or prescribed procedures.”    A writ petition by a prisoner is maintainable if his fundamental  rights are violated.   21.      Having held that a writ of habeas corpus is maintainable  by a person who is under detention if his rights are violated, the  question that remains to be answered is whether in the present  case any right of the detenus was violated which could have led  to the issuance of an order directing his release from prison. We  may make reference to the judgment of this Court in the Col. Dr.  B. Ramachandra Rao v. The State of Orissa & Ors. 6, wherein  it was urged before this Court that the orders of the Court  directing the detention of the petitioner were illegal. In this case,  the Court has held as follows:            “5….This Court does not, as a general rule, go into such           controversies in proceedings for a writ of habeas corpus. Such           a writ is not granted where a person is committed to jail           custody by a competent court by an order which prima facie           does not appear to be without jurisdiction or wholly illegal and           we are not satisfied that the present is not such a case.”     6 (1972) 3 SCC 256                                          15 22.      In Kanu Sanyal              v. District Magistrate, Darjeeling7  this Court while dealing with the writ of habeas corpus has held  as follows:             “4. It will be seen from this brief history of the writ of habeas            corpus that it is essentially a procedural writ. It deals with the            machinery of justice, not the substantive law. The object of the            writ is to secure release of a person who is illegally restrained            of his liberty....”     23.      In Manubhai Ratilal Patel v. State of Gujarat and  Others8, an order of remand was challenged before this Court.  After referring to a large number of judgments9, which we are not  referring in detail since they have all been considered in this  judgment, this Court held as follows:             “31….It is well­accepted principle that a writ of habeas corpus            is not to be entertained when a person is committed to judicial            custody or police custody by the competent court by an order            which prima facie does not appear to be without jurisdiction or            passed in an absolutely mechanical manner or wholly            illegal….”    24.      In Saurabh Kumar v. Jailor, Koneila Jail10, this Court  came to the conclusion that the petitioner was in judicial custody   7 (1973) 2 SCC 674 8 (2013) 1 SCC 314 9 Ranjit Singh v. State of Pepsu, AIR 1959 SC 843,Ummu Sabeena v. State of Kerala, (2011) 10 SCC 781, in the matter of­Madhu Limaye and Others, (1969) 1 SCC 292, Talib Hussain v. State of Jammu & Kashmir, (1971) 3 SCC 118, Sanjay Dutt v. State (II), (1994) 5 SCC 410 10 (2014) 13 SCC 436                                             16 by virtue of an order passed by the judicial magistrate and,  hence, could not be said to be in illegal detention. Justice T.S.  Thakur, as he then was, in his concurring judgment held as  follows:             “22. The only question with which we are concerned within the            above backdrop is whether the petitioner can be said to be in            the unlawful custody. Our answer to that question is in the            negative. The record which we have carefully perused shows            that the petitioner is an accused facing prosecution for the            offences, cognizance whereof has already been taken by the            competent court. He is presently in custody pursuant to the            order of remand made by the said Court. A writ of habeas            corpus is, in the circumstances, totally misplaced…”    25.      The same view has been taken in the                         State   of  Maharashtra and Others v. Tasneem Rizwan Siddiquee11  wherein it was observed that no writ of habeas corpus could be  issued when the detenu was in detention pursuant to an order  passed by the Court. As far as the present cases are concerned,  it is not disputed that the detenus are behind bars pursuant to  conviction and sentence imposed upon them by a court of  competent jurisdiction and confirmed by this Court, whereby  they were sentenced to undergo imprisonment for life.     11 (2018) 9 SCC 745                                          17 26.      Dealing with the meaning of life imprisonment in Gopal  Vinayak Godse v. The State of Maharashtra and Others12  this Court held :­            “…Unless the said sentence is commuted or remitted by           appropriate authority under the relevant provisions of the           Indian Penal Code or the Code of Criminal Procedure, a           prisoner sentenced to life imprisonment is bound in law to           serve the life term in prison”.    Thereafter, a Constitution Bench in Maru Ram v. Union of  India13 approved the view in Gopal Vinayak Godse’s case  (supra) and held that “imprisonment for life lasts until the last  breath…”   27.   We would also like to point out that the grant of remission  or parole is not a right vested with the prisoner. It is a privilege  available to the prisoner on fulfilling certain conditions. This is a  discretionary power which has to be exercised by the authorities  conferred with such powers under the relevant rules/regulations.  The court cannot exercise these powers though once the powers  are exercised, the Court may hold that the exercise of powers is  not in accordance with rules.             In support of his contention  learned senior counsel for the detenus relied upon the Rules of  12 (1961) 3 SCR 440 13 (1981) 1 SCC 107                                       18 the High Court of Madras and referred to Rule 1 of the Rules  which reads as follows:­           “A petition for direction, Order or Writ, including a Writ of         Habeas Corpus, Mandamus, Certiorari, Quo Warranto.         Prohibition or Certiorarified Mandamus or any other Writ shall         be in the form of a Petition accompanied by an Affidavit         containing facts, grounds and the Prayer…”    He has also referred to Rules 11, 12 and 13 of the Rules which  specifically deal with habeas corpus petitions and read as under:           Rule 11:­         “In all Habeas Corpus Petitions, in the Cause Title of the         petition as well as in the accompanying Affidavit, the following         clause should be incorporated just below the case number and         above the name of the petitioner, at the right­hand side:          “(In the matter of detenue) (Full Name of the detenue as found         in the Order of Detention)”. Full Cause Title should be set out         both in the Habeas Corpus Petition and supporting Affidavit.”            Rule 12:­         “Every Habeas Corpus Petition should contain a Schedule in         the following format:          (i)   Name of the Detenue                         :         (ii)  Father’s/Husband’s Name                     :         (iii) Age                                         :         (iv)  Permanent Address                           :         (v)   Identification Marks/(As found               in the order of Detention)                  :         (vi) Date of Detention Order                      :         (vii) Reference Number of the                Detention Order                            :         (viii) Name of the Prison, where the                Detenue is lodged                          :         (ix) Prison Number                                :         ….”                                           19         Rule 13:­         “Following declaration by the Petitioner or Deponent of the         Affidavit should be incorporated as penultimate paragraph of         the supporting Affidavit:          “The Petitioner declares that no other Habeas Corpus Petition         had been filed or moved before this court or before any other         High Court or before the Supreme Court of India         simultaneously seeking for the production of the body of the         person or person of the very same detenue or challenging the         Impugned Order of Detention. The Petitioner further declares         that the facts set out above are true and correct to the best of         his knowledge and no material has been concealed or         suppressed.”    28.    The High Courts are empowered to frame rules in terms of  Article 225 of the Constitution of India but this power is subject  to the provisions of the Constitution of India and to the  provisions of any law of the appropriate legislature. Article 225  reads as follows:­          “225. Jurisdiction of existing High Courts.­ Subject to the         provisions of this Constitution and to the provisions of any law         of the appropriate Legislature made by virtue of powers         conferred on that Legislature by this Constitution, the         jurisdiction of, and the law administered in, any existing High         Court, and the respective powers of the Judges thereof in         relation to the administration of justice in the Court, including         any power to make rules of Court and to regulate the sittings         of the Court and of members thereof sitting alone or in         Division Courts, shall be the same as immediately before the         commencement of this Constitution:         Provided that any restriction to which the exercise of original         jurisdiction by any of the High Courts with respect to any         matter concerning the revenue or concerning any act ordered         or done in the collection thereof was subject immediately         before the commencement of this Constitution shall no longer         apply to the exercise of such jurisdiction.”                                           20 29.    Learned senior counsel for the detenus while referring to  Rules 11, 12 and 13 submitted that unless the petitioners in  terms of Rule 12 mentions the detention order, name of the  prison where the detenu is detained, prison number and does not  challenge the order of detention, the writ would not be  entertained. What description has to be given to a writ is for the  High Court to decide. But the Rules cannot confer jurisdiction  which is not conferred by the Constitution.         We are even  otherwise unable to accept the argument of learned senior  counsel for the detenus because the Rules obviously deal with  cases of detention/preventive detention where the detenu is  under custody. If that custody is legal then obviously no writ of  habeas corpus can be issued for release of the detenu. We are  also of the view that merely because the Rules provide that in the  petition details of the detention order, prison etc., have to be  given does not mean that the writ of habeas corpus cannot be  issued where the Rules are silent. The Rules cannot override the  Constitution.   30.    As already mentioned above, it is well settled law that  even if the detenu is in private detention then also a writ of                                   21 habeas corpus would lie.

SHAH, J.         Not agreeing with the view taken by this Court in the case of E. Micheal  Raj v. Intelligence Officer, Narcotic Control Bureau (2008) 5 SCC 161 taking  the view that when any narcotic drug or psychotropic substance is found mixed  with one or more neutral substance/s, for the purpose of imposition of  punishment it is the content of the narcotic drug or psychotropic substance  which shall be taken into consideration (paragraphs 15 and 19), the following  questions are referred to a three Judge Bench, vide order dated 3.7.2017:       (a) Whether the decision of this Court in E. Micheal Raj (supra)          requires reconsideration having omitted to take note of entry no.          239 and Note 2 (two) of the notification dated 19.10.2001 as also          the interplay of the other provisions of the Narcotic Drugs and          Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (for short “the NDPS Act”)          with Section 21?      (b) Does the impugned notification issued by the Central Government          entail in redefining the parameters for constituting an offence and          more particularly for awarding punishment?      (c) Does the NDPS Act permit the Central Government to resort to          such dispensation?      (d) Does the NDPS Act envisage that the mixture of narcotic drug and          seized material/substance should be considered as a preparation in          totality or on the basis of the actual drug content of the specified          narcotic drug?      (e) Whether Section 21 of the NDPS Act is a stand along provision or          intrinsically linked to the other provisions dealing with          “manufactured drug” and “preparation” containing any          manufactured drug?     Arguments on behalf of the Union of India                                           2 2.    Shri Aman Lekhi, learned Additional Solicitor General of India appearing  on behalf of the Union of India has vehemently submitted that the decision in E  Micheal Raj (supra) has omitted to consider the interplay between different  provisions of the NDPS Act. It is submitted that it has focused only on the  interpretation of Section 21 of the NDPS Act, without giving effect to the  purport of the said provision. It is submitted that the view taken by this Court in  the case of E Micheal Raj (supra) in paragraphs 15 and 19 that it is only the  actual content by weight of the narcotic drug which is relevant for the purposes  of determining whether it would constitute small quantity or commercial  quantity, and the view that when any narcotic drug or psychotropic substance is  found mixed with one or more neutral substance/s, for the purposes of  imposition of punishment, it is the content of the narcotic drug or psychotropic  substance which shall be taken into consideration is clearly wrong and as such  contrary to the entire scheme of the NDPS Act. He argued that if the entire  scheme including the object and purpose of the NDPS Act is considered, it can  be seen that where drugs are sold as mixture the determination for the purposes  of punishment would be aggregated quantity of the mixture;  2.1   In the case of E Micheal Raj (supra), this Court has failed to consider that  the expression “offending material” finds no mention in the NDPS Act. It is  submitted that it is also not the intention of the legislature to levy punishment  based on content of the offending drug in the mixture. It is submitted that in the  case of E Micheal Raj (supra), this Court has erred in relying upon the decision                                           3 in the case of Ouseph v. State of Kerala (2004) 4 SCC 446 as the said decision  was not binding as precedent as it passed sub-silentio the issue with which E  Micheal Raj (supra) was seized with;  2.2   While deciding the case in the case of E Micheal Raj (supra), this Court  has ignored material provisions of the NDPS Act and the entire statutory scheme  to reach a conclusion which was not borne out both by the spirit and the terms of  the statute and defeated the very object behind the enactment and the  amendment;  2.3   The NDPS Act, as originally enacted in 1985 included in Section 2(xx)  the definition of ‘preparation’. It is submitted that the definition of ‘preparation’  reveals that preparation means “in relation to NDPS” one or more drugs or  substance in dosage or solution or mixture.          The ‘mixture’ is defined as  mechanical mixture or two or more substances as distinct from chemical  combination or a fluid with foreign substance in suspension or foreign element  in a composition. The ‘solution’ is defined as a liquid or semi-liquid preparation  obtained by the combination of a solid with the solvent. The ‘dosage’ means a  definite quantity or something regarded as analogous to medicine in use or  effect. A bare look at the definitions, it is apparent that a drug or substance can  be mixed with one or more substances (mixture) or change its physical state by  means of any fluid or solvent (solution) or be divided or apportioned (dosage).  In other words, the NDPS Act as originally enacted dealt not only with the pure  content of the drug or psychotropic substance but, its preparation in a mixture,                                           4 solution or dosage. In the case of E Micheal Raj (supra), there is no reference to  the aforesaid;  2.4   That as per Section 2(xxxiii), also as originally enacted, defining  ‘psychotropic substance’ shows that psychotropic substance includes “a  preparation of such substance”. It is submitted that the said section has to be  read with the Schedule appended to the NDPS Act. The Schedule itself, in Entry  77, included “salts and preparation” of the list of psychotropic substance  mentioned in Entry 1 to 76 of the Schedule. The original NDPS Act therefore  dealt with “preparations” of psychotropic substances. Further, contravention  relating to psychotropic substance was punishable under Section 22 of the  NDPS Act and reading Section 22 with Section 2(xx), 2 (xxxiii) and the  Schedule makes it apparent that punishment covered preparation of psychotropic  substance and was not based on pure substance content. Even Section 2(xiv) of  the NDPS Act, as originally enacted, defined ‘narcotic drugs’, they were defined  to mean (i) Coca leaf; (ii) Cannabis; (iii) Opium; (iv) Poppy Straw; and (v)  Manufactured drugs. Each of the above was defined separately. Therefore, even  in the NDPS Act, as originally enacted, the ‘narcotic drugs’ included their  mixtures and preparations. It is only in the definition of ‘poppy straw’ that the  expression mixture or preparation finds no mention;  2.5   He argued that the only provision in the NDPS Act, as originally enacted,  which specified the quantity was Section 27, the said section mentioned “small  quantity or narcotic drugs or psychotropic substance” and provided for milder                                          5 punishment where it is proved that possession in contravention of the NDPS Act  or rule was intended for personal consumption or there was consumption of any  narcotic drug or psychotropic substance. It is submitted that “small quantity”  was notified in Notification No. S.O.827 of 14.11.1985 which included only 5  drugs. By subsequent notifications, additions were made and more drugs were  included in the list. Therefore the “small quantity” under the amended Act is  much higher than that specified in the earlier notification under the original  NDPS Act. Thus, the NDPS Act, as originally enacted, insofar as narcotic drugs  and psychotropic substances are concerned, only recognized “small quantity  where possession was for personal consumption or there was consumption. The  punishment prescribed under the NDPS Act, originally enacted except in Section  20 which in some circumstances contemplated imprisonment up to 5 years,  provided for punishment of not less than 10 years, but extendable to 20 years.  The NDPS Act, as originally enacted, covered preparations of the narcotic drugs  and psychotropic substances and not merely their pure drug content;  2.6   That in the year 1989, the NDPS Act was amended by Act No.2 of 1989.  That notwithstanding the amendment, the original scheme of punishment under  NDPS Act covering preparations and not just pure content was not interfered  with. In the year 2001, the NDPS Act was further amended and clauses (viia)  defining “commercial quantity” and (xxiiia) defining “small quantity” were  added. A bare look at the two sections shows that the same covered quantity  greater/lesser, as the case may be, than the “quantity specified” by the Central                                          6 Government by notification in the official gazette of the narcotic drugs and  psychotropic substances. Even in/after the 2001 amendment, no change was  made in the definition of “preparation” or in the definition of “narcotic drugs”  and “psychotropic substances”, more particularly even after the addition of the  definitions of “small quantity” and “commercial quantity”. Even the residuary  entry in the list of Psychotropic Substances, i.e., Entry 77 in the Schedule of the  NDPS Act, as originally enacted, is retained even after the amendment as ‘Entry  111’ of the said Schedule. The only reason for the amendment in the year 2001  was that all preparations in the NDPS Act, as originally enacted, were uniformly  punishable with imprisonment from 10 to 20 years and even the condition for  bail did not make any reference to the quantity. It was for this reason that  Section 37 itself was amended to specifically deal with “commercial quantity”  by the amendment of 2001;  2.7   He argued that the “commercial quantity” would necessarily apply to  preparations of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances as the clauses which  were added needed to be read with the provisions of the statute which already  stood therein and had not been amended. This was consistent with the scheme  of the NDPS Act, as originally enacted. The amendment did not in any manner  whatsoever tinker with the same. It is for this reason that the amended Act  referred in the newly inserted clauses to “commercial quantity” and “small  quantity”.   The emphasis therefore was on the quantity in relation to the  drug/substance and not the content of the drug/substance. It was never the intent                                           7 to modify the application of the statute to deal with pure quantity of the narcotic  drugs and psychotropic substance. The same came to be reinforced by the  notification published by the Central Government after coming of the 2001  Amendment which contained Note 2 as under:        “2. The quantities shown against the respective drugs listed above also       apply to the preparations of the drugs and the preparations of the       substances of Note 1 above.”           It is submitted that what was provided in Note 2 was always there since  the original enactment.  2.8    He argued that the “small quantity” now mentioned in the notification is  much higher than the “small quantity” in the NDPS Act as originally enacted. It  is for this reason that both Sections 27 and Section 64A have also been  amended. The possession having been taken out of Section 27, there was no  need to provide for milder punishment for possession as under Section 27 of the  original NDPS Act. Section 27 as amended therefore is confined to  “consuming” any narcotic drugs or psychotropic substance only and the  immunity under Section 64A is limited to ‘addicts’ amongst those to whom  Section 27 applies, in other words, possession even of “small quantity” is  outside Section 27 of the amended Act and immunity is not available to all the  persons to whom Section 27 applies but, only to such of them as are ‘addicts’.  This is a change consequential upon the grading of punishment but, the  punishment continues to relate only to the quantities of the narcotic drugs and                                          8 psychotropic substance which includes their preparations and not the pure drug  content;  2.9   Even without Note 4 of the notification, the NDPS Act would apply to the  entire mixture or solution of the narcotic drugs and psychotropic substance. It is  further submitted that the addition of Note 4 under the notification of 2009, is  irrelevant to the controversy and Judgment in E Micheal Raj (supra) cannot be  sustained even if Note 4 is ignored. The notification therefore does not in any  manner re-define the parameters for constituting an offence or awarding  punishment under the NDPS Act. Shri Lekhi, learned Additional Solicitor  General of India has heavily relied upon the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court  in the case of Chapman v. United States (1991) 500 US 453 in support of his  submission that the sentences should be based exclusively on the weight of the  “mixture or substance” and not on the content – pure drug. It is submitted that  in the said case, the petitioner was convicted of selling 10 sheets of blotter paper  containing 1000 doses of LSD. The weight of LSD alone was approximately  50mg and combined weight of the LSD and the blotter paper was 5.7 grams.  The petitioner was sentenced for mandatory minimum sentence of 5 years  which was applicable for offences of distributing more than 1 gram of the  substance. It is submitted that before the US Supreme Court, it was contended  on behalf of the petitioner that weight of the carrier should not be included  when computing the appropriate sentence for LSD distribution.            The U.S.  Supreme Court rejected the said contention and observed and held as under:                                            9     “We think that petitioners reading of the statute, a reading that makes     the penalty turn on the net weight of the drug rather than the gross     weight of the carrier and drug together is not a plausible one. The     statute refers to a “mixture or substance containing a detectable     amount”. So long as it contains a detectable amount, the entire     mixture or substance is to be weighed when calculating the sentence.     This reading is confirmed by the structure of the statute. With respect     to various drugs, including heroin, cocaine, and LSD, it provides for     mandatory minimum sentences for crimes involving certain weights of     a “mixture or substance containing a detectable amount” of the drugs.     With respect to other drugs, however, namely phencyclidine (PCP) or     methamphetamine, it provides for a mandatory minimum sentence     based either on the weight of a mixture or substance containing a     detectable amount of the drug, or on lower weights of pure PCP or     methamphetamine. For example, S. 841(b)(1)(A)(iv) provides for a     mandatory 10 year minimum sentence for any person who distributes     “100 grams or more of … PCP…or 1 kilogram or more of a mixture     or substance containing a detectable amount of .. PCP…” Thus, with     respect to these two drugs, Congress clearly distinguished between the     pure drug and a “mixture or substance containing a detectable amount     of” the pure drug. But with respect to drugs such as LSD, which     petitioners distributed, Congress declared that sentences should be     based exclusively on the weight of the “mixture or substance”.     Congress knew how to indicate that the weight of the pure drug was to     be used to determine the sentence, and did not make that distinction     with respect to LSD.”     “…A “mixture” is defined to include “a portion of matter consisting of     two or more components that do not bear a fixed proportion to one     another….”     “…By measuring the quantity of the drugs according to the “street     weight” of the drugs in the diluted form in which they are sold,     **1928 rather than according to the net weight of the active     component, the statute and the Sentencing Guidelines increase the     penalty for persons who possess large quantities of drugs, regardless     of their purity. That is a rational sentencing scheme.”                                             (underline is ours)   2.10 He argued that as such the NDPS Act does not make any distinction  between pure drug and a preparation containing the drug. The Act applies to the                                         10 street weight of the drug in the form in which they are sold rather than the net  weight of the active component. This is what the Act has consistently been  provided since its inception. The appellants want this Court to read the statute in  a manner the provisions do not warrant. It is submitted that for instance, a  “small quantity” of heroin is 5 grams, which if taken as only the pure drug  content will translate into 100 grams of street level heroin. At the rate of 0.25  gram heroin the mixture of 100 grams of heroin can yield about 400 doses of  heroin. It can never nor could have been the intention of the legislature or for  that matter of the Government to send the person who possesses or sells heroin  equivalent to 400 doses to a mere six months imprisonment. That therefore if  the submission on behalf of the appellants is accepted, in that case, it will be  contrary to the object and purposes of enactment of the NDPS Act and in most  of the cases there will be no punishment for the “commercial quantity” and the  real culprits/accused will go away with the minor punishment;  2.11 It is further argued that as per the Crawford on Interpretation of Law  (Statutory Construction) “the Court should strive to avoid a construction which  will tend to make the statute unjust, oppressive, unreasonable, absurd,  mischievous or contrary to the public interest. That construction should be  accepted which will make the statute effective and productive of the most good,  as it is presumed that these results were intended by the legislature. In order to  carry out the legislature intent, it is therefore apparent that the statute should be  given a rational, logical and sensible interpretation”;                                            11 2.12 It is further pointed out that the NDPS Act has been passed as per  Statement of Object and Reasons, to “strengthen the existing controls over drug  abuse, considerably enhanced the penalties particularly for trafficking offences,  make provisions for exercising effective control over psychotropic substances”.  The stringency of control cannot disregard the conditions in which the Act  applies. The definitions clearly show that the object of the Act was to deal with  the street weight of the drugs in the diluted form in which they are sold and not  the net weight of the active component. The legislature know that the inactive  ingredients will be combined with the pure drugs and substances and it would be  the drugs or substances so prepared that would be sold to the consumers. He  argued, if the arguments of the appellants are accepted, the legislative intent  would be frustrated through a construction which will render the Act sterile and  which in the circumstances in which the Act is to operate cannot be called either  rational or sensible.  2.13 Shri Lekhi, learned Additional Solicitor General of India has also relied  upon the decision of this Court in the case of urlidhar Meghraj Loya and  another v. State of Maharashtra and others (1976) 3 SCC 684, as well as,  Reema Aggarwal v. Anupam and others (2004) 3 SCC 199 in support of his  submission that while interpreting and/or considering a particular statute, a  judge must not alter the material of which the Act is woven, but he can and  should iron out the creases. The appellants want this Court to alter the material  of which the NDPS Act is woven. In the case of Rajinder Singh v. State of                                          12 Punjab (2015) 6 SCC 477, it was observed and held by this Court that a statute  must be given a fair, pragmatic, and common-sense interpretation so as to fulfil  the object sought to be achieved by Parliament. Therefore, the judgment in E  Micheal Raj (supra) is wrong and the preparations in totality and not the actual  drug content will be seen for computing the quantity. It is submitted that as such  E Micheal Raj (supra) is per incuriam and even the notification of 2009 does not  redefine the parameters for constituting the offence under the NDPS Act.  Section 21 of the NDPS Act is not a standalone provision and must be construed  along with the other provisions in the statute as it is a settled principle of law  that every statute must be construed as a whole and words in the statute take  their meaning from the context and have to be understood to make a consistent  enactment, i.e., ex visceribus actus. It is submitted that even the insertion of  Note 4 was ex abundanti cautela and even without it the same intention could be  culled out from the statute as it stood. It made no change but was intended only  to remove any misconception and was used merely by way of abundant caution.  3.    Shri R.K. Kapoor, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant  in Criminal Appeal No. 722 of 2017 has made the following submissions:  3.1   That the challenge in the present appeal is to the impugned notification  dated 18.11.2009 issued by the Central Government in exercise of the powers  conferred by Clauses (viia) and (xxiiia) of Section 2 of the NDPS Act. The  Central Government did not have the power to issue the impugned notification  by which it has empowered the inclusion of quantity of the neutral material also                                         13 along with the quantity of the narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances in  columns 5 & 6 of the table, in relation to the narcotic drugs or psychotropic  substances mentioned in the corresponding entry in column nos. 2 to 4 of the  said table. Such power to include the neutral material is not provided under  clauses (viia) and (xxiiia) of Section 2 of the NDPS Act. Thus, the impugned  notification dated 18.11.2019 is ultra vires the provisions of the NDPS Act, read  with the amended 2001 Act which brought about rationalisation in awarding the  punishment;  3.2   By the impugned notification, Note 4 has been added after Note 3 at the  end of the table appended to the NDPS Act, included vide Notification S.O.  1055 (E) dated 19.10.2001, whereby the notification was issued specifying  “small quantity” and “commercial quantity” of the narcotic drugs or  psychotropic substances mentioned in column nos. 5 & 6 of the table, in relation  to the narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances mentioned in the corresponding  entry in column nos. 2 to 4 of the said table;  3.3   The result of the issuance of the impugned notification is that the offender  would be awarded the punishment by looking into the total quantity of the  material found in possession of the offender even if on chemical analysis it is  found that the actual content of the narcotic drug or psychotropic substance is  covered under the “small quantity”, but by adding the neutral material the  punishment awarded is for “commercial quantity”. For instance, there are two  offenders. One “A” is having quantity of 4 grams heroin which is less than the                                          14 “small quantity” which is 5 grams, mentioned in column no.5 of the table.  Another “B” is in possession of 1 gram of heroin, but has mixed it with “neutral  material” of 250 grams, it becomes 251 grams, more than the “commercial  quantity” which is 250 grams as per column no.6 of the table. It is submitted  that if these two offenders “A” and “B” are convicted, then “A” would be given  a punishment for 1 year while “B” can be given up to 20 years though actual  content of the offending drug is lesser in case of “B”. It means one year  punishment for heroin and 19 years for “neutral material” which is not otherwise  punishable under the NDPS Act. Thus, the effect of Note 4 is more the dilution,  less the potency of the drug, but more the punishment. Therefore, it would lead  to injustice and would lead to variation in the punishment of the accused  depending upon the quantity of the “neutral material” instead of the “drug  material”;  3.4   The only power given to the Government is to increase or reduce the  quantity of the narcotic drugs or psychotropic substance mentioned in column  no.5 and 6 and nothing more. For instance, in the case of heroin, the quantity  for the “small quantity” can be reduced from 5 gram to 1 gram, and for  “commercial quantity”, it can also be reduced from 250 grams to 100 grams or  so, but no “neutral material” can be permitted to be added to award the quantum  of punishment;  3.5   No “neutral material” has been specified in column no.2 or column no.4  of the table. If “neutral material” was also to be made punishable under the                                        15 NDPS Act, then it should have been mentioned under column no.2 and 4 of the  table and then correspondingly the quantity of the “neutral material” would also  have been specified under “small quantity” and “commercial quantity” under  column nos. 5 and 6 of the table. Since “neutral material” is neither a narcotic  drug nor a psychotropic substance, it has not been mentioned under column nos.  2 and 4 and, therefore, cannot be made punishable under Note 4;  3.6   In the year 2001, NDPS (Amendment) Act, 2001 was brought to  rationalise the quantum of punishment for addicts and less serious offenders and  severe punishment for serious offenders;  3.7   This Court in the case of E.Micheal Raj (supra) held that only the  quantity of the offending article is to be taken into consideration for the purpose  of punishment. If it has been mixed with any other substance, which is non-  offending substance, then not the whole bulk is to be taken into consideration  and that the punishment must be graded in relation to the quantity of the  offending article only;  3.8   A person can be convicted and punished only to the extent it has been  specifically provided under the provisions of the NDPS Act. If a person has to  be punished then there must be specific power and provision for punishment and  only to the extent the punishment has been provided for the commission of a  particular contravention and for a particular specified substance as mentioned  under column nos. 2 and 4of the schedule appended to the Act and not  otherwise.   Under the NDPS Act, Section 21 provides for punishment for                                         16 contravention in relation to manufactured drugs and preparations thereof.  Section 22 deals with punishment for contravention in relation to psychotropic  substances. But there is no punishment for “neutral material” under the NDPS  Act;  3.9    It is settled law that what cannot be done directly can also not be done  indirectly. The NDPS Act was enacted by the Parliament. When in the NDPS  Act itself the “neutral substance” has not been made punishable, the “neutral  substance” cannot be made punishable by the exercise of the executive power by  the Central Government by issuing he impugned notification.            Where ever  “neutral material” was to be included it has been specified under the NDPS Act  itself. It cannot be added with each drug as mentioned in the table.  3.10 The expression “mixture” as such has not been defined under the NDPS  Act, but it has a reference under the definition of the word “preparation”. Even  in the word “preparation”, the reference is again to one or more of such drugs or  psychotropic substances, but there is no reference to any “neutral material”.  3.11 Making the above submissions, it is submitted that thus the Central  Government has no power to make any amendment in Act No. 9 of 2001 and  make the whole of the quantity of the allegedly recovered material from the  offender as the “small, commercial or non-commercial quantity”, by directing  the inclusion of the “neutral substance” in it. Therefore, the notification dated  18.11.2009 is liable to be declared ultra vires and be struck down.                                           17 4.    Shri Manoj Swarup, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the  appellant in Criminal Appeal No. 721 of 2017 – Gursewak Singh @ Sewak v.  State of Punjab, in addition, has made the following submissions:  4.1   The Act itself contemplates inclusion of “neutral material”. Reliance is  placed upon Sections 2(iii), 2(vi), 2(xv) and 2(xvi). That the Act itself provides  the places where “neutral material” would be taken into account. The “neutral  material” should be confined to the places permitted by the Act. Note 4 is to be  limited to only such areas where “neutral material” is permitted by the Act.  Only then Note 4 would be serving a clarificatory purpose;  4.2   In the event Note 4 goes beyond this, then Note 4 seeks to add something  which is not in the Act. In that event, Note 4 would be legislating, identifying  and defining what would constitute a criminal offence and in the process, Note 4  would be expanding the area covered by the Act. It is submitted that this would  be impermissible in law. If “neutral material” is included across the board in all  the narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances, then the object of the 2001  Amendment Act to rationalize sentence structure would be frustrated;  4.3   The Judgment of this Court in the case of E. Micheal Raj (supra) had  noticed the distinction between “small quantity” and “commercial quantity” and  the Objects and Reasons of the 2001 Amendment Act. It is thereafter that the  Court concludes that the 2001 Amendment Act makes punishable vis-à-vis the  “offending substance”. It is submitted that there was no need to discuss Entry  No. 239 of the 2001 notification in detail in the said judgment as Entry No. 239                                        18 was contained merely in a notification and was not the source of power.  Therefore, E.Micheal Raj (supra) rightly concludes that the punishment should  be commensurate to the quantity of the “offending substance” only;  5.    Shri Anand Grover, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the  proposed Intervenor – the applicant – Indian Drug Manufacturers’ Association  has, by and large, made the same submissions which are made by the learned  Senior Advocate(s)/Advocate(s) appearing on behalf of the appellants.        In  addition, the following submissions are made:  5.1   In laying down thresholds for “small quantity” and “commercial quantity”  for narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances vide the 2001 notification, the  Central Government refers to the “chemical name” of the concerned drug in  column 4 of the table.

The respondent, who was a  police constable, filed a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution to challenge his  dismissal from service after a disciplinary enquiry. A Single Judge of the High Court,  by a judgment dated 1 February 2018, dismissed the petition. The Division Bench  reversed the judgment and concluded that there is no evidence in the disciplinary  enquiry to sustain the finding that the respondent committed a murder while on leave  from duty. Independently, he has also been acquitted in a Sessions trial on the  charge of murder. The Division Bench granted the respondent reinstatement in  service with no back wages for the seventeen years that elapsed since his  termination. The State comes in appeal.                                               2                                                                                    PART B   B            Murder, trial and disciplinary enquiry    2            In 1992, the respondent was appointed as a Constable in the police service of  Rajasthan. On 13 August 2002, he proceeded on leave and had to report back on  duty on 16 August 2002. He failed to do so and eventually reported for work on 19  August 2020. He sought and was granted permission for over-staying his leave on  the ground that his brother-in-law, Shankar Singh had died. On 15 August 2002, one  Daulat Singh lodged a written complaint at Police Station, Khamnaur in relation to  the death of his brother Bhanwar Singh, caused by an accident with an unknown  vehicle. The police initially registered a crime under Sections 209 and 304A of the  Indian Penal Code 1. The statements of Daulat Singh, Jodh Singh, Meera and Hamer  Singh were recorded under Section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 19732. It  appeared during the course of the investigation that the death was homicidal. The  investigation by the police proceeded for an offence punishable under the provisions  of Section 302 of the IPC. The respondent was arrested on 9 September 2002.  There were two co-accused, Lokesh Gurva and Iqbal Khan. After the investigation  was completed, a charge-sheet was filed under Sections 302, 201 and 120B.  Sessions Case 3 of 2003 was committed for trial to the court of the Additional  Sessions Judge, Nathdwara.   3            The case of the prosecution was that there was a dispute over land between  the respondent and Bhanwar Singh. Moreover, the respondent’s father had been   1     “IPC” 2     “CrPC”                                                 3                                                                                  PART B   treated for a snake bite by Bhanwar Singh but his witchcraft did not yield result,  leading to the death of the father. According to the prosecution, the respondent bore  a grudge towards the deceased due to this incident and had proclaimed earlier that  he would kill him.   4          During the pendency of the criminal trial, a memorandum was issued on 18  January 2003 to the respondent, followed by a charge-sheet, convening disciplinary  proceedings under the provisions of Rule 16 of the Rajasthan Civil Services  (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules 1958 3. The imputations against the  respondent are extracted below, together with the familiar errors of grammar and  translation:                    “1. That you on 13.08.02 from Station House Officer, P.S.                   Devgarh got one casual leave and one gazette leave                   sanctioned and left for your home, as per which you have to                   attend duty on 16.08.02 at A.M. but you did not attend the                   duty on time and attended the duty on 19.08.02 after                   remaining absent for 3 days, which is proved from record.                    2. That even during the absence period you did not inform                   any officer about the reason of your absence and also not                   submitted any extension, which is proved from record.                    3. That you at your residence on 15.08.02 during leave Shri                   Bhanwar Singh S/o Chandan Singh Rajput R/o Ravo ki Gudli,                   who was working in PWD Department, Nathdwara and was                   going on his duty and because of dispute regarding land                   between you and Bhanwar Singh you with help of Lokesh,                   Iqbal to kill Bhanwar Singh hit him with jeep at Bheel Basti                   Kunthwa, due to which he fell down and while shouting your                   companion Iqbal brought iron rod from jeep and hit on                   forehead of Bhanwar Singh due to which he died on the spot.                   You are an employee of disciplined department and have                   knowledge of law, you have committed such a grievous   3     “the Rules”                                                     4                                                                                PART B                offence, due to which image of police is blurred among public,              which is proved from record.               4. That you after committing murder of Bhanwar Singh, you              and your companion ran away from the spot and having              knowledge of law gave form of an accident to the murder,              which is proved from records and initial inquiry.               5. That you after the said incident by joining duty 19.08.02 at              police station Devgarh while hiding reality and by telling              reason of absence as accident of Bhanwar Singh you get              sanctioned period 3 leaves from the SHO as casual leaves              where you had committed murder. Thus, you have knowingly              mislead your superior officer, which is proved from the initial              inquiry and record .               6. That you are an employee of disciplined department, has              full knowledge of law and despite of having knowledge of law              you committed a heinous crime, which seriously hurt the              image of police department among general public and your              said act has blurred the image of police among public. Your              said act comes under category of 'savior only eater', which is              proved from the initial inquiry and record.”     5     By a judgment dated 8 October 2003, the Additional Sessions Judge  acquitted the respondent and the two co-accused, giving them the benefit of doubt.  The Additional Sessions Judge observed that PW1 Meera and PW2 Poorna Devi,  the daughters of the deceased, were not present at the scene of offence and their  evidence was hearsay. A succession of witnesses – PW3 Jai Singh, PW4 Babudas,  PW5 Sundarlal, PW17 Jagat Singh, PW18 Kishan Singh, PW19 Banshi Lal, PW20  Shankar Singh, PW22 Devi Singh, PW23 Kaisar Singh and PW34 Pratap Singh –  were declared hostile during the course of the trial. The case turned on the evidence  of PW21 Jodh Singh, the alleged eye-witness. The Additional Sessions Judge found  that on 7 September 2000, about 2 years prior to the incident, the deceased had                                                  5                                                                               PART B   intimated the SHO at Khamnaur P.S. recording a threat to his life inter alia from the  respondent. The SHO registered a report under Section 107 of the CrPC and  conducted proceedings. Although finding prima facie that there was enmity between  the respondent and the deceased, the Additional Sessions Judge declined to accept  the evidence of PW21. While evaluating it in the context of the co-accused, Lokesh,  the Additional Sessions Judge noted:               “Thus, this evidence is prima facie … that accused Heem              Singh has enmity with deceased Bhanwar Singh. Whether              due to this enmity Heem Singh by conspiring with co-accused              persons by telling accident by jeep with aid of co-accused              Iqbal committed murder of Bhanwar Singh, on this point the              observation of this Court is that accused Lokesh Gaurva who              was told as jeep driver by the witness Jodh Singh at the time              of incident, against that Lokesh Gaurva by involving with              Heem Singh at the time of incident hitting Bhanwar Singh by              jeep such evidence is not given by PW-21 Jodh Singh.              Additional Public Prosecutor on this point during cross-              examination has not taken on record by seeking any              clarification or declaring PW-21 as hostile. Thus, there is              no evidence on record for conviction of accused Lokesh              Gaurva under Sections 302, 201, 120B IPC read with Section              34 IPC.”                               (emphasis supplied)     The above extract indicates that the Public prosecutor did not have PW21 declared  hostile, though this should have been ordinarily, the correct course of action. The  Additional Sessions Judge declined to believe the testimony of PW21 insofar as the  respondent and co-accused Iqbal were concerned, finding that the witness was  inconsistent and untrustworthy. The respondent was given the benefit of doubt and  was acquitted.                                                   6                                                                            PART B   6     The disciplinary enquiry on the charge of murder proceeded with much the  same evidence. Jodh Singh was the star witness during the disciplinary  proceedings. During the course of the disciplinary enquiry, the enquiry officer  recorded the statements of PW1 Jodh Singh, PW2 Devi Singh, PW3 Shankar Singh  and PW4 Hamer Singh among several witnesses. The disciplinary enquiry led to the  submission of the enquiry report. The enquiry officer found the charges to be  proved. The findings on each of the charges are extracted below:              “CHARGE NO.1              Said constable on 13.08.02 from Station House Officer, P.S.             Devgarh get on one casual leave and one gazette leave             sanctioned and left for his home who has not attended the             duty on time and attended the duty after 3 days, which is             proved from the statements of Shri Bhanwar Singh, S.I. SHO             Devgarh, Shri Bhanwar Singh Const. No.351, Shri Rajesh             Kumar, Const. No. 563 & Shri Munishwar Mishra, Ka.Ii. and             from copy of GD Report. Thus, I found the said charge as             completely proved.              CHARGE NO.2              The Constable during the absence period did not inform any             officer about the reason of his absence and also not             submitted any extension, which is proved from records and             statements of Shri Muniswar Mishra, Ka. Li. Force Branch,             Shri Bhanwar Singh S.I. SHO Devgarh. Thus, I found the said             charge as completely proved.              CHARGE NO.3              The said constable at his residence on 15.08.02 during leave             Shri Bhanwar Singh S/o Chandan Singh Rajput R/o Ravo ki             Gudli, who was working in PWD Department, Nathdwara and             was going on his duty and because of dispute regarding land             between him and Bhanwar Singh, he with help of Lokesh,             Iqbal to kill Bhanwar Singh hit him with jeep at Bheel Basti             Kunthwa, due to which he fell down and while shouting his             companion Iqbal brought iron rod from jeep and hit on                                                7                                                                      PART B   forehead of Bhanwar Singh due to which he died on the spot. Thus, being an employee of disciplined department and having knowledge of law, he has committed such a grievous offence due to which image of police is blurred among public.  In respect of said charge the prosecution has produced statements of Jodh Singh PW-1, Devi Singh PW-2, Shankar Singh PW-3, Hamer Singh PW-4, out of which Jodh Singh PW-1 in his statement at the time of incident has proved presence of himself, charged constable and tractor at the place of incident. Similarly, witness Shankar Singh PW-3 stated that he saw half an hour ago to the incident, the charged constable roaming near place of incident and his parked tractor. Similarly, witness Shri Hamer Singh PW-4 stated that there is prior enmity between charged constable and deceased Bhanwar Singh and prior to the death of father of charged constable, stating through witness to Bhanwar Singh that I will kill him by hitting with jeep or tractor and the incident of same kind is committed. Similarly, witness Shri Nanalal SHO Khamnaur PW-9 also in his statement against the charged constable on finding offence verified arresting him and seizure of iron rod, jeep & tractor used in the incident. Thus, from the aforesaid analysis the said charge is found as completely proved.  The charged constable in defense of said charge has produced a copy of order passed by the Hon'ble Additional Sessions Judge Nathdwara in case related to said incident, after perusal of which it is found that the Hon'ble Court has not completely acquitted the said constable rather acquitted by giving him the benefit of doubt. From this it is clear that the Hon'ble Court has not acquitted charged constable in free form. Thus, I found said charge as completely proved due to which the image of police has blurred.  CHARGE NO.4  It is the charge against constable that he after committing murder of Bhanwar Singh, along with his companions ran away from the spot and having knowledge of law gave form of an accident to the murder.  PW-1 Jodh Singh, PVV-3 Shankar Singh, PW-4 Hamer Singh, PW-9 Nanalal has confirmed the aforesaid charge. Thus, said charge is completely proved from the enquiry.                                        8                                                                                 PART B                CHARGE NO.5               It is the charge against constable that he while joining duty on              19.08.02 at police station Devgarh by hiding reality and by              telling reason of absence as accident of Bhanwar Singh he              got sanctioned period of 3 leaves from the SHO as casual              leaves.               Said charge is proved from the statements of witnesses PW-7              Shri Rajesh Kumar, PW-6 Bhanwar Singh S.I. and aamad              report Ext. P-8 written by charged constable. Thus, I found              the said charge as completely proved.               CHARGE NO.6               It is the charge against constable that he being an employee              of disciplined department, has full knowledge of law and              despite of having knowledge of law he has committed a              heinous crime, which seriously hurt the image of police              department among general public.               Since, from the enquiry the Charge No. 1 to 5 are completely              proved. Thus, the said charge automatically gets completely              proved.”     7     The disciplinary authority issued a notice to show cause to the respondent on  23 October 2003, to which he submitted a response on 17 November 2003. On 11  December 2003, the District Superintendent of Police came to the conclusion that  though the respondent had been given the benefit of doubt in the criminal trial, the  charges against him stood established. He was dismissed from service. The appeal  preferred by the respondent was dismissed by the Inspector General of Police on 17  June 2005. A review before the State Government was dismissed on 29 August  2008. This led to the institution of writ proceedings before the High Court. A learned  Single Judge of the High Court, by a judgment dated 1 February 2018, rejected the  Writ Petition. In appeal, the judgment of the Single Judge was reversed by the                                                  9                                                                                PART C   Division Bench on 24 April 2019. By its judgment, the Division Bench directed re-  instatement of the respondent in service with consequential benefits but without  back-wages.     C       Submissions of counsel    8       Mr Ashish Kumar, AAG appearing on behalf of the appellants submits that:   (i)     In a disciplinary enquiry involving a charge of misconduct, the test is whether          the charge is established on a ‘preponderance of probabilities’ unlike in a          criminal trial where the prosecution has to establish their case ‘beyond          reasonable doubt’;   (ii)    While exercising judicial review under Article 226 of the Constitution against          the findings in a disciplinary enquiry the court cannot reappreciate the          evidence in the manner of an appellate court, and so long as the finding of          misconduct is based on some evidence, no interference is warranted;   (iii)   The High Court has failed to ascribe adequate weight to the orders in the          disciplinary proceedings: the order dated 11 December 2003 pursuant to          departmental proceedings; the order dated 17 June 2005 of the Inspector          General of Police exercising appellate powers; and the order dated 29 August          2008 in review proceedings passed by the Home Department; and   (iv)    The evidence in the disciplinary enquiry indicates that:                                              10                                                                               PART C         (a)    There was enmity between the deceased and the respondent arising               out of a dispute over land;        (b)    The co-accused was found at the scene of offence;        (c)    The deceased had a couple of years prior to the incident, lodged a               complaint with the police apprehending danger from the respondent;        (d)    The evidence of PW1 Jodh Singh and PW3 Shanker Singh showed the               presence of the respondent in the vicinity; and        (e)    The judgment in the criminal trial, acquitting the respondent of the               offence of murder, did not constitute a clean acquittal but was founded               on the benefit of doubt.   9     On the above grounds, it was urged that the High Court has transgressed the  limitations on its power of judicial review in allowing the appeal, setting aside the  judgment of the Single Judge and in interfering with the disciplinary penalty imposed  by the appellants.   10    On the other hand, Mr Jasmeet Singh, learned Counsel appearing on behalf  of the respondent submitted that:   (i)   The departmental enquiry was concluded in violation of the rules governing        the enquiry. All the orders in the disciplinary enquiry were based on the        examination-in-chief of an alleged eye-witness, PW1 Jodh Singh, while        ignoring that his deposition was completely demolished in the course of the        cross-examination;                                               11                                                                                  PART C   (ii)    In the course of the cross-examination, PW1 Jodh Singh admitted that he had          named the respondent only under the pressure of the Sarpanch. The          disciplinary authority as well as the appellate and reviewing authorities          ignored vital evidence, and consequently their findings were perverse;   (iii)   Since the alleged crime took place outside the scope of service, it was          incumbent upon the department to place reliance on the entire record of the          Sessions trial in which the respondent was acquitted. The departmental          enquiry is based on a selective examination of the records of the Sessions          Court;   (iv)    The entire evidence on record would demonstrate that the respondent was          not even remotely connected with the murder of Bhanwar Singh; and   (v)     There is a “minor charge” against the respondent of availing of three days          extra casual leave without informing the superior officer. On this charge, it has          been submitted that:           (a)      The grant of additional casual leave was approved upon his joining                   duties by the superior officer and the charge was duly modified to state                   that the approval was taken by misrepresenting facts; the respondent                   was alleged to have concealed his involvement in the crime of murder;          (b)      If the charge of being involved in the murder is not established, this                   charge will cease to exist; and                                                   12                                                                               PART D         (c)    Even assuming, without conceding, that the respondent was guilty of               taking casual leave without informing the superior, he was never guilty               of such conduct in the past and the leave was taken because of the               death of his brother-in-law.   11    On the basis of the above submissions, it has been urged that the findings in  the departmental enquiry were perverse and have been correctly set aside by the  Division Bench of the High Court. The respondent has been out of service for 17  years and has (it has been urged) had to combat the social stigma of being  terminated from service. The High Court having since re-instated the respondent  without back-wages, it was urged that no interference by this Court is warranted.     D     Proof of misconduct in disciplinary proceedings    12    The primary charge in the disciplinary proceedings relates to the involvement  of the respondent in the murder of Bhanwar Singh. According the respondent, the  disciplinary enquiry pertains to an event which took place outside the fold of his  service. It was asserted that the disciplinary enquiry in regard to the involvement of  the respondent in a murder bore no nexus to his employment. This submission  cannot stand scrutiny, having regard to the nature of the employment and the  position of the respondent as member of the police force. The respondent was a  constable in the service of the police department of the State of Rajasthan since  1992. Involvement of a member of the police service in a heinous crime (if it is                                               13                                                                                    PART D   established) has a direct bearing on the confidence of society in the police and in  this case, on his ability to serve as a member of the force. Such an individual is  engaged by the State as a part of the machinery designed to preserve law and  order. The State can legitimately assert that it is entitled to proceed against an  employee in the position of the respondent in the exercise of its disciplinary  jurisdiction, for a breach of the standard of conduct which is expected of a member  of the state police service. Confidence of the State in the conduct and behaviour of  persons it has appointed to the police is integral to its duty to maintain law and  order. The real issue is whether the charge of misconduct stands established in this  case on the basis of some evidence, applying the evidentiary principle of a  preponderance of probabilities.   13        The standard of standard of proof in disciplinary proceedings is different from  that in a criminal trial. In Suresh Pathrella v. Oriental Bank of Commerce 4, a two  judge Bench of this Court differentiated between the standard of proof in disciplinary  proceedings and criminal trials in the following terms:                    “ …the yardstick and standard of proof in a criminal case is                   different from the disciplinary proceeding. While the standard                   of proof in a criminal case is a proof beyond all reasonable                   doubt, the proof in a departmental proceeding is                   preponderance of probabilities.”     4     (2006) 10 SCC 572                                                     14                                                                                     PART E   This standard is reiterated by another two-Judge Bench of this Court in Samar  Bahadur Singh v. State of U.P. 5:                    “Acquittal in the criminal case shall have no bearing or                   relevance to the facts of the departmental proceedings as the                   standard of proof in both the cases are totally different. In a                   criminal case, the prosecution has to prove the criminal case                   beyond all reasonable doubt whereas in a departmental                   proceedings, the department has to prove only                   preponderance of probabilities.”     E         Findings of the disciplinary enquiry    14        On 13 August 2002, while posted at Police Station Devgarh, the respondent  took a day’s casual leave and one ‘gazetted leave’ and was to report back on 16  August 2002. It is admitted that he over-stayed his leave and joined on 19 August  2002. According to the respondent, the additional leave was sanctioned after he  joined back on duty. The State as his employer claims that the respondent  concealed the intervening circumstance of his involvement in the murder of Bhanwar  Singh on 15 August 2002. Now it is important to note that the respondent was  placed under arrest on 16 September 2002 much after he had rejoined duty and was  released on bail on 30 October 2002. Since the arrest took place after he rejoined  duties, it cannot be said that there was a suppression by him of his custodial  detention when he joined duties on 19 August 2002. In any case, this part of the  charges is subsidiary to the main charge in the disciplinary proceedings. In the   5     (2011) 9 SCC 94                                                      15                                                                                  PART E   departmental proceedings, broadly speaking, the charges that were leveled against  the respondent were:   (i)     Over-staying leave by a period of three days beyond the leave that was          sanctioned;   (ii)    Not seeking an extension of leave from the superior officer;   (iii)   Involvement in the murder of Bhanwar Singh (the respondent is alleged to          have run away from the scene of offence and tried to give it the colour of an          accident);   (iv)    Getting additional leave sanctioned by suppressing the correct reason on a          misrepresentation to the superior officer; and   (v)     Conduct which has hurt the image of the police department.     15      The respondent was tried for the offence of murder and was acquitted by the  Sessions Court on 8 October 2003. During the course of the criminal trial a  succession of prosecution witnesses were declared hostile (PWs 3, 4, 5, 17,  18,19,20,22, 23 34). The Additional Sessions Judge found it unsafe to rely upon the  evidence of the sole eye-witness, Jodh Singh (PW21 at the Sessions Trial) based on  the inconsistencies in his evidence. In fact, the trial judge even observed that no  steps had been taken by the Public prosecutor to have him declared hostile. The  acquittal of the respondent on the charge of murder was based on the now familiar  spectacle of prosecution witnesses turning hostile. It is true that the acquittal brought                                             16                                                                                PART E   finality to the question as to whether he had committed the offence of murder  punishable under the Penal Code. However, the disciplinary enquiry stood on a  broader footing. The disciplinary proceedings related not merely to the involvement  of the respondent in the murder, but to the violation of service rules and the impact  of his conduct on the image of the police force.   16    On the primary charge of the involvement of the respondent in the murder of  Bhanwar Singh, Jodh Singh (PW1 in the Disciplinary Enquiry) was the prime  witness, as in the criminal trial. Jodh Singh was an engine mechanic and stated in  the course of his examination on 18 July 2003 that two or three years earlier, the  respondent came to him with an engine crane for repair together with Iqbal Khan  (who was also a co-accused at the Sessions trial). The witness stated that Iqbal  Khan had assaulted Bhanwar Singh with an iron rod when he was proceeding on a  cycle near Bheel Basti Nala. Further, he stated that on the same day he had seen  the respondent about 300 feet away from the scene of offence going towards  Nathdawara on a cycle. Also, about 300 feet away from the scene of offence, he  found the tractor of the respondent parked. Jodh Singh claims to be an eye-witness  to the murder of Bhanwar Singh by Iqbal. In quite the same vein as he did during the  criminal trial, during the course of his cross examination, Jodh Singh did not support  his statements during the examination in chief. For the completeness of the record, it  is necessary to extract the relevant part of the cross-examination which has been  recorded in question and answer form in the enquiry proceedings:               “Cross through Pairokar Heem Singh Const. No.642                                              17                                                                                 PART E                1. Question - After 20 days of this incident Sarpanch Shri             Pratap Singh called at his house and told that you shall get             written name of Heem Singh and Lokesh also along with             Iqbal, I refused then Sarpanch Ji told that you have to get             name of Heem Singh written therefore, I told name of them in             the statements given to police.              2. Is it correct that you saw Iqbal while killing Bhanwar Singh             but at that time Heem Singh was not present there at the time             of incident. Yes, It is true.              3. Is it correct that you did not know about giving of threats to             kill by Heem Singh to Bhanwar Singh. Yes, it is true.              4. Is it correct that on that day you are going to Gudla from   "

Vodafone also place reliance on the decision of               this Court in Tata Teleservices Limited vs. CBDT, 386               ITR 30 and Bombay High Court in Group M Media               India (P) vs. Union of India, 2016 SCC OnLine Bom               13624, which held that the return should be processed               within a year and only where the assessing officer is               of the view that issuance of refund would be               detrimental to collection of demands which may arise,               he may invoke the provision of Section 143(1D) of               the Act.                                       ………                13. With respect to the delay in processing of the tax               return, Vodafone places reliance on the decision of               this Court in Tata Teleservices Limited vs. Central               Board of Direct Taxes (supra), and the decision of the               Bombay High Court in Group M Media India (P) vs               Union of India (supra), where it was held that the               return should be processed within a year and only               where the assessing officer is of the view that               issuance of refund would be detrimental to collection               of demands that may arise, he may invoke the               provision of Section 143(1D) of the Act. From the               perusal of Section 241A of the Act, it is evident that               all tax returns are necessarily to be processed within               the time period as prescribed under Section 143(1) of               the Act.

It was contended that after the lapse of the one                 year period, by reason of second proviso to Section                 143 (1), the right to claim refund is vested in any                 assessee. Counsel argued that this is independent of                 the Revenue's power to issue a scrutiny notice under                 Section 143 (2), for which the period of limitation is                 longer. However, if the Assessing Officer does not                 issue any notice, or intimation, if the assessee can                 claim refund, that right is a statutorily vested one if,                 within the said period of one year, a reasoned order is                 not made under Section 143 (1D) within the said one                 year period.""

The revenue denies allegations of deliberate                 omission to refund amounts aggregating to                 Rs.4759.74 crores along with applicable interest and                 states that income tax returns were not processed                 under Section 143(1). The assessment years under                 consideration were picked up for scrutiny under                 Section 143(3) and there is a prima facie likelihood of                 a substantial demand being raised by the Income Tax                 Department, as has been done earlier in Vodafone's                 earlier case. Further, the revenue submitted that in                 Vodafone's own case for the AY 2011-12 wherein the                 returned loss was Rs. 33,93,397 and subsequently, the                 income determined by the Assessing Officer was                 Rs.546,64,25,250/-.                                        ………                  21.

Further, the Ld. Counsel placed               reliance on Section 143(1D) of the Act to explain that               the refund has not been processed till date. The Ld.               Counsel urged that sub-section (1D) of section 143               which starts with a non-obstante clause provided that               notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section               (1), the processing of the return shall not be necessary               before the expiry of the period specified in the second               proviso where a notice has been issued to the assessee               under Section 143(2). The provisio to Section 143               (1D) provided that such return shall be processed               before the issuance of an order under sub-section (3).               Therefore, Section 143 (1D) overrides Section 143               (1). Therefore, the counsel submitted that under               Section 143(1D) of the Act, the processing of return               shall not be necessary, where notice has been issued               under Section 143(2) of the Act.                22. The Counsel placed on record letter               F.No.ACIT/C-26(2)/2018-19/216 dated 23.07.2018. It               is in response to the multiple communications by the               assessee for expeditious processing of returns for               different AYs. The order informs that the cases are               pending for scrutiny as follows; for the AY 2012-13               and 2013-14, the assessment is under special audit               and for the AY 2014-15, the assessee approached the               AAR and lastly, returns for AYs 2015-16 and 2016-               17, are under scrutiny. The assessment years for               which request has been made to process the return               under Section 143(1) are already under scrutiny for               the various AYs. Therefore, exercising the power               under Section 143(1D), the Assistant Commissioner               declined the processing of returns under Section               143(1). Further, the case is under compulsory scrutiny               for AY 2017-2018, exercising the power Section               241A, the Assistant Commissioner declined the               processing of returns under Section 143(1)……..""

ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX CIRCLE 26 (2) & ANR.)                                                                             9               ""29. In the facts of the present case, the issue               canvassed is on the interpretation of Section 143 (1D)               of the Act. It is first necessary to refer to the statutory               provisions and thereafter consider the effect of such               provisions on Vodafone's request for refund for the               said assessment years. On reading of the Section 143               of the Act, it is apparent that when returns are filed               either under Section 139 or pursuant to a notice under               Section 142(1), Section 143(1) mandates that the               returns shall be processed in the manner prescribed in               the clauses (a) to (e) thereof. The processing of a               return thus involves determination of total income or               loss, tax and interest, if any, payable and sum payable               by, or the amount of refund due to the assessee.               Section 143(1)(d) stipulates that an intimation shall be               prepared or generated and sent to the assessee               specifying the sum determined payable by, or the               amount of refund due to the assessee under clause(C).               Section 143 (1) (e) provides that the amont of refund               due in pursuance of the determination under clause               (C) shall be granted to the assessee. A reading of               proviso to Section 143 (1) reveals that it mandates               that the intimation as provided in Section 143 (1) (d)               should be issued before the expiry of one year from               the end of the financial year in which the return is               made. Before proceeding to Section 143(1D) as it               stood at the relevant time, it is essential to refer to               Section 143 (2) and (3). Sub-section (2) contemplates               issuance of a notice in the contingency covered by the               said provision. Sub-section (3) provides that once               such a notice is served, after following the procedure               laid, the Assessing Officer is required to pass an order               in writing making an assessment of the total income               or loss and determine the sum payable by the assessee               or refund of any amount due to him on the basis of the               assessment. It is also relevant to notice that whether it               is the processing of a return under Section 143(1) or               an order under Section 143(3) is subject to the same               time limit, i.e. Section 153(1).                                          ………                39. A reading of the above judgments and the               relevant provisions, clearly shows that Section 143(2)               empowers, the Assessing Officer to issue notice to the               assessee to produce documents or other evidence, to CIVIL APPEAL NO. 2377 OF 2020 (@ SLP (C) NO.1169 OF 2019) VODAFONE IDEA LTD (EARLIER KNOWN AS VODAFONE MOBILE SERVICES LIMITED) VS. ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX CIRCLE 26 (2) & ANR.)                                                                           10               prove the genuineness of the income tax return. Under               Section 143(1D) of the Act an introduced by the               Finance Act, 2012 processing of a return under               Section 143 (1)(a) is not necessary where a notice has               been issued under Section 143(2) of the Act. This               provision has now been amended by the Finance Act,               2016 (with effect from the AY 2017-18) to provide               that if scrutiny notice is issued under Section 143(2),               processing of return shall not be necessary before the               expiry of one year from the end of the financial year               in which return is submitted.                40. The assesse's argument in these proceedings is               that once the one year period in proviso to Section               143(1) ends, the return - and whatever calculations are               contained in it, with respect to tax liability as well as               the consequential refunds, become final, subject to               only one event: issuance of notice under Section 143               (2).                41. To this Court, it appears that the net effect of Tata               Teleservices (supra) is that the revenue cannot be               inactive, in cases where the assessee claims refund,               and the one year period is over (under proviso to               Section 143(1) ends. The Assessing Officer has to               apply his mind to consider whether the facts and               circumstances of the case, warrant some or all of the               refund of the assessee’s amounts, or if all of it needs               to be withheld, whenever the assessee presses for               refund. This exercise should be undertaken promptly,               keeping in mind the time limit under the normal               provision of Section 143(1) expires. This Court held               in Tata Teleservices Ltd. (supra) and the Bombay               High Court in case of Group M Media India (P) Ltd.               (supra) that it would be wholly inequitable for the               Assessing Officer to merely sit over the petitioner’s               request for refund citing the availability of time up to               the last date of framing the assessment under Section               143 (3). The proper interpretation of the statute and               the situation in such a case would be, the Assessing               Officer should take up an expeditious disposal of the               question once the assessee requests for release of the               refund.                                        ……… CIVIL APPEAL NO. 2377 OF 2020 (@ SLP (C) NO.1169 OF 2019) VODAFONE IDEA LTD (EARLIER KNOWN AS VODAFONE MOBILE SERVICES LIMITED) VS. ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX CIRCLE 26 (2) & ANR.)                                                                          11               44. Now in this case, acknowledgement or intimation               had not been sent by the Assessing Officer. There is               no doubt that the period of one year indicated in the               second proviso to Section 143 (1). However, Section               143 (1D) begins with a non-obstante clause that               overbears that provision. Tata Teleservices (supra) and               the Bombay High Court ruling in Group M Media               India (supra) state that the fact that a regular               assessment is resorted to, does not ipso facto mean               that in every case, the Assessing Officer has to refuse               refunds or there is an automatic bar to refunds. The               Assessing Officer has to apply his mind and make an               order keeping in perspective the facts of the case.               45. In this case, the revenue has relied on an order               dated 28.07.2018, which inter alia, stated that               ""considering pending special audit, pending scrutiny,               opening demands of amount more than 4500 crore, it               will be prejudicial to the interest of the revenue to               process the returns without completion of the pending               scrutiny cases. Therefore, exercising powers under               Section 143(1) and under Section 241A of the Act, the               undersigned decline the processing of returns under               Section 143(1)."" The senior counsel for Vodafone had               attacked the reliance on this order, stating that it was               made later. However, that is an aspect this Court               cannot go into. Facially, the order contains reasons.               Therefore, unlike Tata Teleservices, a reasoned order               was made; that decision was based on a circular,               which fettered the Assessing Officer's discretion.               Therefore, the CBDT circular was set aside.                                       ………                49. As far as the argument that the expiry of the one               year period, per second proviso to Section 143(1)               resulting in finality of the intimation of acceptance,               this Court is of opinion that the deeming provision in               question, i.e. Section 143 (1) (d) only talks of two               eventualities: ""shall be deemed to be the intimation in               a case where no sum is payable by, or refundable to,               the assessee under clause (c), and where no               adjustment has been made under clause (a).”               Secondly, that intimation or acknowledgement cannot               confer any greater right than for the assessee to ask               the Assessing Officer to process the refund and make               over the money; it is up to the Assessing Officer - CIVIL APPEAL NO. 2377 OF 2020 (@ SLP (C) NO.1169 OF 2019) VODAFONE IDEA LTD (EARLIER KNOWN AS VODAFONE MOBILE SERVICES LIMITED) VS. ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX CIRCLE 26 (2) & ANR.)                                                                              12                  wherever the possibility of issuing a notice under                  Section 143 (2) exists, or where such notice has been                  issued, to apply his mind, and decide whether given                  the nature of the returns and the potential or likely                  liability, the refund can be given. It does not mean                  that when an assessment - pursuant to notice under                  Section 143(2) is pending, such right to claim refund                  can accrue. This Court also recollects the decision of                  the Supreme Court in Deputy Commissioner of                  Income Tax v Zuari Estate Development &                  Investment Co Ltd. 2015 (15) SCC 248 which held                  that an intimation under Section 143 (1) is not to be                  considered as an assessment.""

L]      In the Special Leave Petition (from which this appeal arises)      questioning the aforesaid decision of the High Court, notice was issued      by this Court on 18.01.2019. In the affidavit in reply, the respondents      asserted:-                   ""7. That having extracted the relevant provisions, it                  would be relevant to state that the petitioner itself has                  made several averments before the High Court that is                  facing ""precarious financial conditions"" with an                  accumulated loss of Rs.5,557 crores and debts                  amounting to Rs.53,000 crores as on 31.03.2017"". It                  is equally pertinent to state that the Respondent-                  Revenue had filed a counter affidavit on 3rd July,                  2018 against the Writ Petition in the High Court of                  Delhi wherein it has been categorically averred that                  there are huge pending demands against the petitioner                  herein more than of Rs.5000 Crores.

That it is also submitted that the order dated 23rd                  July, 2018 passed by the Assessing Officer is an order                  under Section 143(1)(D) for the assessment years                  2012-13 to 2016-17 as evident from a bare reading of                  the said order giving reasons for refusal of refund                  claimed by Vodafone Mobile Service Limited. As far                  as the refusal of refund claimed for the A.Y. 2017-18                  is concerned, the said order draws its power under                  Section 241A of the Act as clearly stated in the order                  dated 23rd July, 2018.""                 Reference was made to various pending proceedings where the      demands raised for earlier assessment years were stayed and it was      stated:-                   ""24.

The                  reasoning was based upon pending special audit,                  pending scrutiny and pending demands of more than                  Rs.5000 crore. Further, the letter/order was not                  beyond limitation because Section 143(1D) starts with                  a non-obstante clause, which is over and above the                  provisions of Section 143(1), which has been                  discussed in Para 44 of the impugned judgment.""

ASI, Meha Singh met Azad Singh, the complainant, at  the emergency ward in PGIMS, Rohtak. Azad Singh made a statement which  was reduced into writing upon which a First Information Report4 being FIR No.  781 was registered under Section 154 of the Criminal Procedure Code 5 at Police  Station Sadar, Rohtak. The complainant stated that his elder son Sandeep was  studying in the final year of the LLB degree course in Maharishi Dayanand  University, Rohtak 6. On 26 December 2006, Sandeep had gone to the law  department in the University to prepare for the exams. The complainant’s son-in-  law had come to their house and was in a hurry to leave after meeting Sandeep.  They tried to contact Sandeep on his cell phone but were unable to get through.  The complainant and his younger son, Sunil, then proceeded on their motor-cycle  to the University. At about 2:30pm when they reached the parking in proximity to  the law department, they saw that 6 men standing under the tin sheds started  firing shots at Sandeep who was standing there. Sandeep was alleged to have  fallen down upon which the complainant and his son, Sunil, rushed towards the  spot. The three young men fled towards the Delhi road on a silver coloured  Pulsar make motor-cycle. The complainant stated that he had not noted the  registration number of the motor-cycle but could identify the assailants, if they  were brought before him.

However, he succumbed to the fire arm injuries before reaching the  hospital. The complainant, Azad Singh, stated that his son had strained relations  with some persons and those persons had killed him.    3     As a result of the investigation, initially, accused Rajesh alias Sarkari and  Ajay Hooda were apprehended and arraigned. Subsequently, accused Pehlad,  was also arraigned to face trial.

The accused were examined after the conclusion of the evidence of  the prosecution under Section 313 of the CrPC to explain the circumstances  which appeared against them in the evidence of the prosecution. They claimed  innocence and stated that they have been falsely implicated. One of the  appellants, Rajesh alias Sarkari, stated that the victim was implicated with him as  a co-accused in another case; that there was no dispute between them and that  his photographs have been published in the newspaper. The accused examined  5 witnesses in support of their defence as noted by the judgment of the Sessions  Court:                 “11. …the accused have examined as many as five witnesses                namely Jiley Singh as DW1, Rajesh Jogpal, Record Keeper                as DW2, Shamsher Singh as DW3, Parveen as DW4 and                Sikander as DW5, in their defence evidence.”     4        During the course of the trial, PW1, Head Constable Karan Singh, deposed  that on 26 December 2006, he had joined the investigation of the case and  together with ASI, Meha Singh and others, had reached the scene of offence at  the University. He recovered seven empty cartridges, one lead and blood-stained  earth which were packed into a parcel and sealed. Among the other recoveries,  was a liquor bottle with some quantity of liquor. The principal eye witnesses  whose evidence was relied upon by the prosecution were the complainant (PW4-  Azad Singh) and his son (PW5-Sunil). PW4 stated that on 26 December 2006, he  and PW5 had proceeded to the University where Sandeep had gone to prepare  for his examinations, as Sandeep could not be contacted on his telephone. At  2:30 pm when they reached near the cycle-stand of the law department, they saw                                              4 the car belonging to Sandeep parked there. Sandeep was standing under the  cycle shed together with three persons. When PW4 and PW5 were at a distance  of about 100 feet from Sandeep, they saw him being fired at with pistols or  revolvers. PW4 identified the appellants in Court as the assailants at the scene of  offence. All the three accused are stated to have departed from the scene after  executing the crime. PW4, in the course of his evidence, stated that thereafter, he  and PW5 took Sandeep to the Casualty Department of PGIMS, Rohtak in the  Santro car, where he was declared to be brought dead. The police were stated to  have reached the hospital and to have recorded his statement as Exhibit PB. The  deposition of PW5 was in similar terms. Significantly, both PW4 and PW5 stated  that they had removed Sandeep in his car to PGIMS, Rohtak which was at  variance with the FIR which recorded that Sandeep had been removed to the  hospital by “Parveen, son of Zile Singh Hooda, and by another person”. PW7-  Jagram, Sub-Inspector, deposed that ASI Meha Singh had deposited two sealed  parcels, one containing blood-stained earth and the other containing 7 empty  cartridges as well as one lead with him, which he subsequently forwarded to the  FSL, Madhuban on 8 January 2007. PW9- Sumit Kumar, Constable, prepared a  scaled site-plan marked as Exhibit PJ.

In pursuance of the disclosure made by the accused Rajesh alias  Sarkari, the Pulsar motor-cycle bearing registration No. HR-10-H/2241 was  recovered from his residence on 24 June 2007 in Sector IV Bhiwari, Rajasthan.  PW19-Ram Kishan, SI, in the course of his deposition, stated that a pistol had  been recovered from the rented house of accused Rajesh alias Sarkari at Palam  Vihar, Gurgaon. PW19 also deposed to the recovery of a pistol from the rented  house of accused Ajay Hooda at village Carterpuri, Gurgaon. The recovery of the  fire arm at the behest of the accused was sought to be corroborated by the  evidence of PW20-Head Constable Jai Kishan and PW21- Meha Singh. PW21-  Meha Singh, a former Sub-Inspector, had received the ruqqa on 26 December  2006 from PGIMS, Rohtak. PW21 was a part of the police team which had  reached the scene of offence and had lifted seven empty cartridges and one lead  from the spot.                                                  8 5       The FSL report dated 29 November 2007, marked as Exhibit PD, stated  that seven 7.62mm mauser pistol fired cartridges and one 7.62mm mauser pistol  fired bullet had been recovered from the place of occurrence; and two 7.62mm  deformed and mutilated fired bullets had been recovered from the body of the  deceased who had been fired at from a country made pistol. The pistol had been  received in an earlier FIR, being FIR No. 311 at Police Station, Civil Lines,  Rohtak and was stated to have been recovered from accused Rajesh alias  Sarkari.    6       Five defence witnesses, during the course of their deposition, stated:  (i)     DW1- Zile Singh denied that he had let-out his house to accused Ajay          Hooda and stated that the police had not visited the house in connection          with any recovery. The witness stated that he had seen the accused Ajay          Hooda for the first time in Court;  (ii)    DW2- Rajesh Jogpal, Record Keeper stated that accused Rajesh and the          deceased Sandeep had faced trial in a case arising out of the FIR No. 341          dated 23 June 2001 registered at Police Station, Civil Lines, Rohtak under          Sections 454/380 of the IPC. The case had been decided on 20          September 2008. Azad Singh, the complainant/PW4 had stood surety for          Sandeep in the said case;  (iii)   DW3- Shamsher Singh, Executive Officer, Hari Bhumi Newspaper, Rohtak          stated that three news items regarding the incident were published in the          newspaper on 23 February 2007, 13 April 2007 and 1 July 2007;                                                  9 (iv)   DW4- Parveen, s/o Zile Singh, deposed that on the date of the occurrence         he, together with Sikandar (DW5), was present along with Sandeep at the         cycle-stand of the law department at the University. Sandeep was         consuming alcohol while sitting in his car and after some time parked his         car inside the shed and sat down on the ground where he continued to         drink. After sometime, 5-6 persons came there on two motor-cycles and         fired indiscriminately upon Sandeep. Sandeep fell down in an injured         condition and was removed by DW4 and DW5 to PGIMS, Rohtak where he         was declared dead by the doctors on duty. DW4 stated that the father and         other relatives of Sandeep reached the mortuary about 10 to 15 minutes         after their arrival. The police came there and recorded his statement. DW4         stated that the father of the deceased (PW4) was not present at the scene         of the occurrence and the accused presented in the Court were not the         assailants who had fired shots at Sandeep; and  (v)    DW5- Sikandar, s/o Ashok Rathi, deposed along similar lines to DW4 and         stated that he and DW4 had taken Sandeep to PGIMS, Rohtak and had         informed the father and brother of Sandeep of the occurrence, who had         accordingly reached PGIMS, Rohtak.   The FSL Reports, Exhibit DY, DY/1 and DY/2 were also tendered in the course of  the defence evidence.    7      The Sessions Court, by its judgment dated 12 June 2012, concluded that  there was a ring of truth to the case of the prosecution and that the appellants  were guilty of the offence of having committed the murder of Sandeep. The                                          10 appellants and the co-accused Pehlad were, following their conviction under  Section 302 read with Section 34 of the IPC, sentenced to imprisonment for life.  Aggrieved by the judgment of the Sessions Court, all the three accused filed  appeals in the High Court of Punjab and Haryana. By a judgment dated 17  January 2019, the High Court dismissed the appeals.   8       Leading the submission on behalf of the appellants, Mr Rakesh Khanna,  learned Senior Counsel urged the following submissions:   A       PW4 and PW5 are not eye-witnesses   (i)     PW4 and PW5 were not present at the scene of the offence and their          depositions stating that they were eye-witnesses to the occurrence are          untrustworthy;  (ii)    The FIR which was lodged in close proximity to the occurrence of the          crime on the statement of PW4 clearly states that Sandeep was removed          to the hospital by Parveen, son of Zile Singh Hooda, and another person.          In the depositions of PW4 and PW5, there is a marked improvement when          they stated that both of them have accompanied the deceased who was in          an injured condition to PGIMS, Rohtak;  (iii)   Parveen, son of Zile Singh Hooda, deposed as DW4 and confirmed that it          was he and Sikandar (DW5) who had taken Sandeep to the hospital. Both          DW4 and DW5 stated that PW4 and other relatives of the deceased          reached the mortuary after 10 to 15 minutes and neither PW4 nor PW5          were present at the scene of offence;                                              11 (iv)      The information(ruqqa) sent by the Causalty Medical Officer on 26            December 2006 records that the deceased Sandeep was brought to            PGIMS, Rohtak by “Sandeep Lehri, son of Zile Singh Hooda resident of            Kailash Colony, Rohtak”. The name ‘Sandeep’ Lehri is an inadvertent error            in place of ‘Parveen’ who is also described as the son of Zile Singh Hooda,            resident of Kailash Colony, Rohtak;  (v)       The post-mortem report and the statement of PW14 indicates that injury            nos. 1, 5, 6, 10 and 11 showed blackening, charring and ecchymosis at the            margins. PW4 in his deposition has stated that the accused fired at            Sandeep from a distance of 4-5 feet. However, as explained in the            decision of this Court in State of Rajasthan v. Daud Khan 7, blackening of            injuries can only be observed if the pistol is fired from a very close range,            i.e., 2 feet or less. This indicates that PW4 and PW5 were not present at            the site; and  (vi)      On the above grounds, it has been submitted that neither PW4 nor PW5            are eye-witnesses to the occurrence.    B         The Forensic Science Laboratory8 report   (i)       There are three FSL reports on the record – two relate to FIR No. 311 of            2006 and one pertaining to the present case which arises out of FIR No.            781 of 2006;     7     (2016) 2 SCC 607 8     FSL                                               12 (ii)    The first FSL report dated 12 March 2007 pertains to FIR No. 311 where          three parcels containing the clothes of injured persons, one 7.65mm fired          bullet taken from the body of an injured person by the name of Kuldeep,          four 7.65 mm fired pistol cartridge cases and one 7.65mm live pistol          cartridge were collected from the place of occurrence.

The          third parcel with the seal of L.S.Y SOS (Ball) FSL (H) contained one 7.65          mm fired bullet already marked as BC/1 in the earlier first FSL report dated          12 March 2007. The fourth parcel had a number and seal impression L.S.Y          SOS (Ball) FLS (H) and contained four 7.65mm fired cartridge cases and          one 7.65mm live cartridge (the fired cartridge cases were already marked          as C/1 to C/4 in the earlier first FSL report dated 12 March 2007);                                             13 (iv)   In the laboratory examination, it was stated that both the pistols were test         fired and that their firing mechanisms were found in working order. The         class as well as individual characteristic marks present on the 7.65mm         fired cartridge cases C/1 to C/5, 7.62mm / 0.30” misfired cartridge marked         MC/1, 7.65mm fired bullet BC/1 and those on the test fired cartridge cases         and bullets fired from pistols marked W/1 and W/2 were examined. In the         result, it was stated that pistols W/1 and W/2 were in working order. The         7.65mm cartridge case marked C/5 was found fired from pistol W/2.         However, the 7.65mm fired cases C/1 to C/4 and 7.65mm fired bullet         marked BC/1 were not fired from the pistol marked as W/1. In so far as the         7.62mm misfired cartridge MC/1 is concerned, it was found to be misfired         from pistol W/2. All the exhibits were resealed along with their original         wrappers with the seal of L.S.Y SSO (Ball) FSL (H). One 7.65mm cartridge         received in parcel No. 4 has been used in test firing in the laboratory; and  (v)    The third FSL report dated 29 November 2007 pertains to FIR No. 781         lodged in the present case. In the description of articles, five parcels were         stated to have been received on 8 January 2007. According to the         submission, the receipt or description of parcels sealed by the ballistic         expert is not mentioned, as per his report dated 25 September 2007.

The lead pieces marked BC/4 and BC/5 in parcel         5 were also examined. The lead piece BC/4 was found to be a 0.455”         revolver bullet. No regular rifling marks were observed.    9      On the basis of the above narration, it has been submitted that:  (i)    The parcel containing the pistol marked as W/2 and the test fired bullet,         sealed by the ballistic examiner as per the second FSL report dated 25         September 2007, admittedly had not been received and described in the         description of articles contained in the third FSL report dated 29 November         2007, arising from FIR No. 781 (present case);  (ii)   There is no material on record to establish that it was brought to the notice         of the Assistant Director, RK Koshal, who examined the articles contained         in the parcels, about any connection of the parcels received for         examination, with the parcels examined in the second FSL report dated 25         September 2007;                                            15 (iii)   The description of the pistol in the second FSL report dated 25 September          2007 indicates that it is chambered for 7.62mm/0.30” cartridges. However,          the description of the cartridges received in the third FSL report in this          case is 7.62mm mauser pistol fired cartridge cases. The recovery memo in          regard to the place of occurrence refers to seven empties and one          cartridge bearing the description of S and B 7.62 X 25, whereas in the          second FSL report dated 25 September 2007 the description is 7.62mm /          0.30” cartridge; and  (iv)    Though the author of the third FSL report dated 29 November 2007 states          that the cartridge cases marked C/1 to C/7 and the bullet marked BC/1 to          BC/3 had been fired from the country made pistol marked W/2, the said          pistol was never produced before the author of this report nor was any          information placed before him about the interconnection of pistol W/2 and          the cartridge cases to C/1 to C/7 or the fired bullets BC/1 to BC/3. The IO          of the present case, PW21, has, in the course of his cross-examination,          admitted that on the empty shells Exhibits P4 to P10, there was an          inscription 7.62K 25, which does not tally with the description recorded in          the second FSL report dated 25 September 2007 or the third FSL report          dated 29 November 2007.   10      On the basis of the above discrepancies, it has been urged on behalf of  the appellants that the prosecution has failed to establish that PW4 and PW5  were eye-witnesses at the scene of occurrence. Moreover, the prosecution has  failed to establish the correctness of the FSL report. The ballistics examiners  have not been examined in the course of the evidence tendered by the                                           16 prosecution. The discrepancies in the FSL reports could have been explained in  the course of the examination by the FSL examiners. Their non-examination cuts  at the root of the case of the prosecution and would entitle the appellants to an  acquittal.    11      On the other hand, Mr Deepak Thukral, learned Standing Counsel  appearing on behalf of the Haryana, has opposed the submissions of the  appellants and submitted:  (i)     As regards the presence of PW4 and PW5, the Sessions Court noted that          the deceased had sustained 13 injuries as a result of the fire arm attack.          PW4 and PW5 who had come to the scene of the offence on their motor-          cycle could not possibly have removed the deceased on a two-wheeler to          the hospital and hence it was DW4- Parveen who took him in the car          belonging to the deceased;  (ii)    Corroboration of the presence of PW4 and PW5 at the scene of offence is          established by the fact that the track suit of the deceased was handed over          by PW5 to the police. One of the articles that has been examined in the          course of the third FSL report is the track suit of the deceased. This would          indicate the presence of PW4 and PW5;  (iii)   PW4 and PW5 were cross-examined at length on their presence at the          scene of occurrence. Their testimony is corroborated by the medical          evidence which suggests that the death occurred due to extensive fire arm          injuries;                                              17 (iv)     As regards the FSL reports, the test cartridges were fired from pistol W/2           and the test firing was carried out in the lab. The test cartridges and test           bullets were again compared. However, the third FSL report inadvertently           mentions that pistol W/2 was recovered from Rajesh though it was actually           recovered from Ajay;  (v)      Though the third FSL report does not refer to pistol W/1 which was           recovered from Rajesh, his conviction can be sustained under the           provisions of Section 34 of the IPC having regard to the extensive nature           of the fire arm injuries and the recovery of fire arms;  (vi)     Both the appellants refused the test identification parade and an adverse           inference ought to be drawn. The explanation of the appellants that they           did so because their photographs were published in the newspapers is           belied by the fact that out of the three newspaper publications, only one           had mentioned their names and none of them had published their           photographs;  (vii)    The FSL reports were filed by the defence after the statements of the           appellants under Section 313 of the CrPC were recorded, and the failure to           examine the ballistics examiner must be construed from that perspective;  (viii)   The eye-witness account of PW4 and PW5 finds corroboration in the           medical evidence and the FSL report; and  (ix)     Though the appellants have sought to discredit the prosecution version by           a"

SHAH, J. Signature Not Verified  Digitally signed by Jayant Kumar Arora Date: 2020.08.31 19:33:48 IST Reason:                  Leave & permission granted in the respective special leave           petitions.                                                                   2   2.    After considering the judgment rendered by a three Judge  Bench of this Court in the case of State of U.P. v. Dinesh Singh  Chauhan1, another three Judge Bench, pursuant to order dated  13.4.2018 in the case of T.N. Medical Officers Association v. Union  of India2,    has referred the present batch of cases to a larger  Bench.   2.1   In the case of Dinesh Singh Chauhan (supra), a three Judge  Bench construed the provisions of Regulations 9(IV) and 9(VII) of  the MCI Postgraduate Medical Education Regulations, 2000, as  amended on 15.2.2012 (hereinafter referred to as the “MCI  Regulations 2000”). In the case of Dinesh Singh Chauhan (supra),  while considering the aforesaid Regulations, this Court held that  the aforesaid Regulations do not provide for any reservation for  in­service government doctors in PG degree courses, and  therefore, the State Government order providing the reservation  for PG degree courses for in­service government doctors is held to  be illegal.  2.2   The present batch of cases came up for hearing before  another Bench of three Judges. The Bench was of the opinion   1 (2016) 9 SCC 749 2 (2018) 17 SCC 478                                                                              3   that the present batch of cases require consideration by a larger  Bench and that is how the present batch of cases are referred to  a larger Bench.       On the basis of the submissions made, the  following reasons were mentioned:        “(i) The decision in Dinesh Singh Chauhan1 has not considered       the entries in the legislative lists of the Seventh Schedule, more       particularly Entry 66 of the Union List and Entry 25 of the       Concurrent List;           (ii) The main contention of the petitioners is that while       coordination and determination of standards in institutions for       higher education falls within the exclusive domain of the Union       (Entry 66 List I), medical education is a subject in the       Concurrent List (Entry 25 List III). Though, Entry 25 of List III is       subject to Entry 66 of List I, the State is not denuded of its       power to legislate on the manner and method of making       admissions to postgraduate medical courses;           (iii) The contentions which have been raised in the present       batch of petitions were not addressed before this Court in       Dinesh Singh Chauhan1;          (iv) The judgment in Dinesh Singh Chauhan1 does not       consider three decisions of the Constitution Bench in R.       Chitralekha v. State of Mysore (1964) 6 SCR 368 :AIR 1964 SC       1823, Chitra Ghosh v. Union of India (1969) 2 SCC 228 and       Modern Dental College & Research Centre v. State of M.P. (2016)       8 SCC 353; and          (v) There are decisions rendered by Benches of an equal       strength as in Dinesh Singh Chauhan1.”    2.3   Now so far as Civil Appeals arising out of the Special Leave  Petitions(C) Nos.26448­26449 of 2019 are concerned, they arise  out of the impugned judgment and order dated 01/10/2019 in  MAT Nos. 1245 and 1267 of 2019 passed by the High Court at  Calcutta, by which the Division Bench of the High Court has                                                                     4   dismissed the batch of appeals confirming the order passed by  the learned Single Judge holding that the State has no authority  to reserve 40% seats for the in­service doctors and 60% seats for  open category doctors.  2.4    In Writ Petition (Civil) No. 196 of 2018 filed under Article 32  of the Constitution of India, the petitioners – Tamil Nadu Medical  officers’ Association and others, for and on behalf of the in­service  doctors in the State of Tamil Nadu have prayed for the following  reliefs:        a)    declare by issuance of a writ of mandamus or any        other suitable writ/order/direction that Regulation 9 of        the Post Graduate Medical Education Regulations, 2000        (more particularly, Regulation 9(IV) and 9(VII), does not        take away the power of the States under Entry 25, List III        to provide for a separate source of entry for in­service        candidates seeking admission to Degree courses;         b)   Alternatively, if Regulation 9 of the Post Graduate         Medical Education Regulations, 2000 is understood to         now allow for States to provide for a separate source of         entry for in­service candidates seeking admission to                                                                    5         Degree courses, declare, by issuance of a writ of        mandamus or any other suitable writ/order/direction,        Regulation 9 (more particularly, Regulation 9(IV) and        9(VII) as being arbitrary, discriminatory and violative of        Article 14 and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution and also ultra        vires the provisions of the Indian Medical Council Act,        1956.        Somewhat similar prayers are also sought for on behalf of  the in­service doctors in the State of Kerala (Writ Petition (Civil)  No. 252/2018); in­service doctors working in the State of  Maharashtra (Writ Petition (Civil) No. 295/2018); and for and on  behalf of the in­service doctors working in the State of Haryana  (Writ Petition (Civil) No. 293 of 2018).  2.5   IA Nos.61442, 61443 and 61445 of 2020 have been  preferred by the GMS Class II Medical Officers Association being  aggrieved by the Public Notice dated 28.02.2019 as amended by  the Corrigendum dated 10.03.2019, wherein, Medical Council of  India has permitted the conversion of Diploma seats into Degree  seats in the State of Gujarat. The said application is filed for and                                                                     6   on behalf     of in­service Medical Officers working in the State of  Gujarat.   2.6   IA No.24759 of 2020 in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 258 of 2018  has been preferred by Kerala Government Insurance Medical  Association and others supporting the reservation for in­service  Medical     Officers/Candidates   in   the    Post­graduate   Degree  Courses.  3.    Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respective  petitioners/parties,   more   particularly,   Tamil   Nadu    Medical  Association, State of Tamil Nadu, State of West Bengal and  others in support of the reservation for in­service Medical  Officers/ Candidates/Doctors in Post­graduate Degree Courses  have made the following submissions:  3.1. The moot question is whether the State Government is  competent to provide for a reservation for candidates who are  already serving the Government. Such reservation is made for  Post­graduate seats in the different medical colleges in the State.  The competence of the State Government is traceable to Article  245 r/w Entry 25 List III of the 7 th schedule to the Constitution.  It cannot be said that there has to be a legislature made law to                                                                   7   provide for such reservation. The Government can in exercise of  its power as an Executive under Article 154 provide for such  reservation and it has been so provided as well.        Once competence is found in favour of Government then  only question is one of a possible conflict with a Central Law and  the resolution of any question of repugnancy. It is submitted that  said question really does not arise in the present case;  3.2. The competence of the State Government to bring about a  law dealing with admissions of in­service candidates is upheld by  the Constitutional Bench of this Court in the case of Modern  Dental College and Research Centre and Others vs. State of  Madhya Pradesh and Others3. The argument raised on behalf of  the Centre that Entry 25 of List III itself would be subject to  Entry 66 of List I has also been considered by this Court;  3.3. There is no question of any conflict of Entry 25 of List III  and Entry 66 of List I. The subject of admission to courses is  referable to Entry 25 of list III and not Entry 66 of List I. It is  submitted that conflict, if any, can only be between a State Law     3 (2016) 7 SCC 353                                                                           8   and a Central Law both sourced to Entry 25 of List III. That no  such conflict is present in the instant case;  3.4. There is no plenary law by the Centre provided for any  reservation for in­service candidates. In other words, there is no  Central Law governing the said aspect, therefore, it would be  competent for the State Government to provide for a reservation  for in­service candidates. In the absence of a Central Law, it is  obviously open to the State Government to provide for a legal  instrument, whether by way of a statute or by an executing order  providing a reservation for in­service candidates;  3.5. The MCI Regulations, 2000, which are made under the  Medical Council Act provide for a reservation in Post­graduate  Diploma Courses for in­service candidates serving with the  respective   State   Governments.      There    is   no   bar    to   such  reservation in Post­graduate Degree Courses. The bar, if any, has  to be express and cannot be implied. Clause 9(IV) of the MCI  Regulations, 2000 can be construed as provided for community  reservations and also a reservation for in­service candidates.  Even   otherwise,    it   does   not   enable    explicitly     the   State  Government to provide for a weightage in marks, amongst in­                                                                   9   service candidates. Thus, the legislative instrument which could  be sourced to the MCI, which in turn is a body established by the  Central Government under the Medical Council Act itself  recognizes an empowerment of the State Government, inter alia,  to lay down the modalities to regulate or provide for a reservation  for in­service candidates in Post­graduate seats. If that be so,  then the actual prescription of a reservation for in­service  candidates, in relation to Post­graduate Degree seats obviously  has not come into conflict with the MCI Regulations, 2000 so as  to attract Article 254 of the Constitution;  3.6. The MCI Regulations, 2000, not expressly providing for a  reservation   in    Post­graduate     Degree   seats,   specifically  empowering the State Government to do so, but only touches  upon the reservation in Diploma seats, it does not follow that the  State Government is incompetent to provide for reservation for  in­service candidates in Degree seats as well. The competence of  the State Government to provide for reservation for in­service  candidates is not sourced to the MCI Regulations, 2000, but it is  sourced to Entry 25 of List III. Thus, the absence of any mention  of reservation for candidates in Post­graduate Degree seats in the                                                                 10   Regulations, 2000 cannot support a submission by the MCI that  consequently the State Government would be incompetent to  provide for any reservation for in­service candidates in Degree  seats;  3.7. The MCI Regulations, 2000 would become relevant only  when it provides for reservation in Post­graduate Degree seats  and the State Government brings about a policy of reservation in  Post­graduate Decree seats at variance from the protocol laid  down in the MCI Regulations. The MCI Regulations, 2000 are  silent in regard to the reservation in Post­graduate Degree seats  and therefore, possible repugnancy under Article 254 of the  Constitution of India really cannot arise between an instrument  by the State Government and an instrument by the Central  Government which does not cover the subject or touch upon the  subject provided for by the State Government;  3.8.     Assuming without admitting that though MCI Regulations  do provide for a conversion of Diploma seats into Degree seats, by  the State Government with the approval of the MCI, the MCI  Regulations, 2000 do not specifically mention the consequences  of such conversion. When law provides for a particular event to                                                                      11   take place then all reasonable consequences that emanates  therefrom should also be inferred, should be applied to the  present situation as well;  3.9. Even    MCI   Regulations,     2000   themselves   provide     for  reservation for in­service candidates in Diploma and also  provides for service condition to be fulfilled thereunder.          The  conversion of Diploma seats into Degree seats (now after 2018)  would obviously result in the same permissible reservation for in­  service candidates to be provided for Degree seats as well. All that  would be required is the imposition of the same conditions as are  provided in the Diploma seats;   3.10.The decision of this Court in the case of Dinesh Singh  Chauhan (Supra) also requires re­look in view of the subsequent  development viz. Notification dated 12.07.2018 by which, MCI  has permitted the Medical College/Medical Institution to “seek  equal number of Post­graduate Degree seats by surrendering  recognized   diploma   seats   in   corresponding   course”.   It    is  submitted that pursuant to the said Notification the medical  colleges/institutions are/were given the option of converting the  available post graduate diploma seats into Post­graduate Degree                                                                   12   seats in a 1:1 ratio. It is submitted that pursuant to the said  notification most of the medical colleges/medical institutions in  the   respective   States   have   surrendered   the   Post­graduate  Diploma seats and have converted the same to Post­graduate  Degree seats. It is submitted that resultant effect is that now  there shall not be any Post­graduate Diploma seats available and  therefore, in­service candidates are left in a situation where even  the limited benefit conferred on them in form of 50% reservations  in Post­graduate Diploma Course can no longer be availed. As a  result, in­service candidates have been left in a complete lurch  since they would neither be able to qualify for Post­graduate  Degree course in adequate numbers nor be in a position to avail  the Post­graduate Diploma seats previously available in the  Government Colleges. In view of the above development, the  reasoning in the case of Dinesh Singh Chauhan (supra) as to the  difference in the Regulations between Post­graduate Diploma and  Degree courses no longer survives;  3.11. Right of the State Government to set apart a definite  percentage of educational seats at Post­graduate level consisting  of Degree and Diploma courses exclusively for a class of persons                                                                        13   as a separate source of entry has been repeatedly upheld by this  Court with the condition that source is properly classified –  whether on territorial, geographical or other reasonable basis and  has a rational nexus with the object of imparting a particular  education and effective selection for the purpose. Reliance is  placed upon the decision of this Court in the cases of (1) Kumari  Chitra Ghosh and Anr. vs. Union of India & Ors. 4; (2) D.N.  Chanchala vs. The State of Mysore and Ors.5; (3) K Duraisamy &  Anr vs. State of Tamil Nadu and Ors 6; (4) AIIMS Students Union  vs. AIIMS7; and (5) State of Madhya Pradesh & Ors vs. Gopal D  Tirthani and Ors8;  3.12.              It has been consistently held by this Court that there  is a legitimate and rational basis in providing a separate  channel/source of entry for in­service candidates in order to  encourage them to offer their services and expertise to the State.  It is submitted that this Court has acknowledged that this has a  sufficient nexus with the larger goal of equalization of educational  opportunities and to sufficiently prefer the doctors serving in the  various hospitals run and maintained out of public funds, in the 4   (1969)   2   SCC   228 5   (1971)   2   SCC   293 6   (2001)   2   SCC   538 7   (2002)   1   SCC   428 8   (2003)   7   SCC   83                                                                  14   absence of which there would be serious dearth of qualified Post­  graduate doctors to meet the requirements of the common public;  3.13.     Unlike reservation envisaged for Scheduled Caste/  Schedule Tribes, this is a distinct and vitally important public  purpose in itself absolutely necessitated in the best of public  interest. In the case of Dinesh Singh Chauhan (supra) this Court  has held that no fault can be found with the method of providing  a separate channel of entry for in­service candidates for the  reason that the facilities for keeping up with the latest medical  literature might not be available to such in­service candidates  and the nature of the work makes it difficult for them to acquire  knowledge about very recent medical research, which the  candidates who has come after freshly passing their graduation  examination might have;   3.14.In the case of Modern Dental College and Research Centre  (supra), the Constitution Bench of this Court has affirmed that  even though Entry 25 List III is subject to Entry 66 List I, the  power of States to enact laws concerning admissions would not  stand extinguished so long as such laws did not have the effect of  wiping out the law enacted by the Union under Entry 66 List I;                                                                   15   3.15.When the States create a separate source of entry for in­  service candidates, the standards of medical education are not  impinged inasmuch as;        (a). only eligible in­service candidates can qualify i.e.       those have obtained minimum eligibility marks;       (b). amongst eligible in­service candidates admission is       made based on inter­se­merit;       (c). The preferential weightage would merely alter the       order in which in –service candidates would rant in the       merit list prepared for in­service candidates. Thus, it       would not be a case of ‘double reservation’;   3.16.As held by this Court in the case of Yatinkumar Jasubhai  Patel & Ors vs. State of Gujarat and Ors 9, which was in the  context of “institutional preference” for Post­graduate Medical  Admission, only obligation by virtue of introduction of NEET is  that the State cannot hold any separate test for admissions to  Post­graduate courses. As observed, even while giving the  admission in the State quota/institutional reservation quota, the  merit determined on the basis of NEET will still have to be  considered. It is submitted that therefore, provision of a separate  source of entry for in­service candidates shall not dilute the  standards of higher education in any manner since the   9 (2019) 10 SCC 1                                                                  16   candidates in question would still have to obtain the minimum  merit prescribed under NEET;  3.17. The reservation referred in the opening part of Regulation  9(IV) is only with respect to reservation as per the constitutional  scheme i.e. SC, ST and OBCs and not for in­service candidates or  Medical Officers in–service. This is also acknowledged by this  Court in the case of Dinesh Singh Chauhan (supra) in para 25.4.  It is submitted that therefore, there is no merit in the statement  of defence by the respondent that in­service candidates for Post­  graduate Degree Course are already governed by the reservation  provided for in Regulation 9(IV);  3.18.It is submitted that so far as State of Tamil Nadu is  concerned, the Hon’ble Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu in his letter  dated 25.4.2017 to the Hon’ble Prime Minister, has highlighted  that providing only 30% weightage to in­service candidates  seeking admission to Post­graduate Degree Course is not enough  since if this procedure is followed, out of the 557 Post­graduate  government seats available under the State quota in Tamil Nadu,  only 20 seats would go to in­service quota candidates. It is  submitted that vide letter dated 6.2.2019, the State of Tamil                                                                   17   Nadu wrote to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and  highlighted the contribution of the policy to provide 50%  reservation for in­service candidates in Post­graduate degree  courses in attracting meritorious Doctors to Government service  and also enabling the State Government to provide uninterrupted  health care in rural, difficult and remote areas of the State. It is  submitted that it was further highlighted that this reservation  was critical for the maintenance of quality health care in the  government medical facilities;  3.19.Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the State of Tamil  Nadu has highlighted the benefits to be achieved by providing  50% reservation for in­service candidates in Post­graduate  Degree/ Diploma Courses. It is submitted that continuance of  given incentive marks and reserving 50% seats for in­service  candidates who performed duty in remote, rural area, hilly  terrain etc. in Post­graduate courses will sustain the achievement  made by the State Government in the health sector and provide  valuable medical care to the poor and vulnerable society. It is  submitted that therefore, it is in the larger public interest of the  State that there is a provision for 50% reservation in Post­                                                                  18   graduate      Degree/Diploma    Courses/seats      for   in­service  candidates;  3.20. So far as the State of West Bengal is concerned, learned  counsel appearing on behalf of the State of West Bengal as well  as Government Doctors serving in the Government Hospitals in  the State of West Bengal in support of the reservation of 40% of  the state quota Post­graduate Medical seats for in­service Doctors  have made in addition to the following submissions:  3.20.1.    That the State of West Bengal has enacted the West  Bengal Health Services Act, 1990 for controlling the services of  the in­service doctors. Under Section 21 of the said Act, the State  has the Rule making power and in exercise of that power the  State has enacted the West Bengal Health Service and the West  Bengal Medical Education Service and the West Bengal Health  and Public Administrative Service (Placement on Trainee Reserve)  Rules, 2015. As per the note of Rule 3 of the said Rules, the State  is empowered to make reservation in the seats of the Medical  Courses of the State Universities for its officers under West  Bengal Health Service and the West Bengal Medical Education  Service and the West Bengal Health and Public Administrative                                                                   19   Service. It is submitted that such note was also there in the  Rules of 2008, which came to be repealed in view of enactment of  Rules 2015. That the Government vide order dated 18.4.2013  provides for the reservation of 40% of the State quota Post­  graduate Medical seats for the in­service doctors in exercise of  such power;  3.20.2.    That the action of the State to provide in­service quota  is in the discharge of its positive constitutional obligations to  promote and provide better health care facilities for its citizens by  upgrading the qualifications of the existing in­service doctors so  that the citizens may get more specialized health care facility.  Such action is in discharge of its constitutional obligations as  provided in Article 47 of the Constitution of India which is the  corresponding fundamental right of the citizens protected under  Article 21 of the Constitution of India;  3.20.3.    The State can fix a separate source of admission as the  in­service doctors are distinct class. The classification has  sufficient nexus with the laudable object of meeting the  requirement of qualified Post­graduate doctors for the public                                                                   20   health service. Reliance is placed upon decision of this Court in  the case of Sudhir N vs. State of Kerala and Ors.10;   3.20.4.      By way of providing separate source of entry to the in­  service doctors, the State has not impinged upon the minimum  standards prescribed by the Medical Council of India as in­  service candidates are selected on the basis of their merit  assessed on the basis of their marks obtained in the NEET  examination;  3.20.5.        The action of providing separate quota for the in­  service doctors is not violative of the Regulation 9(IV) of the MCI  Regulations, 2000 as the same categorically states in an  unambiguous manner, inter alia, that the reservation of seats  shall be as per applicable laws prevailing in the State. By giving  restrictive meaning to the term ‘reservation’ as only constitutional  reservation, it would be putting words to the legislation which is  otherwise unambiguous and includes all kinds of reservation  including that of in­service;  3.20.6.      In­service Doctors come with vast practical experience  of serving several years in the Government Health Services and   10 (2015) 6 SCC 685 (paras 22 to 24)                                                                   21   treating countless patients. Whereas the fresh MBBS graduates,  even though may score higher because of their recent connection  with the textbooks, do not have any such experience. Their  marks are only reflective of their theoretical knowledge and  ability to memorize and answer examination questions. It is  submitted that thus, in­service Doctors having vast experience  and fresh graduates having no such experience, form two  different classes and cannot be equated. It is submitted that  forcing in­service Doctors to compete with the fresh graduates in  their theoretical knowledge will be extremely, unfair, illogical and  irrational;  3.21.In addition, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the  private appellants in the Civil Appeals arising out of impugned  judgment and order passed by the High Court of Calcutta and in­  service candidates have further submitted that the reservation  notification was issued on 18.4.2013 and the writ petition has  been filed after first counselling was over for 2019 admission. All  admissions were completed in May 2019 and 285 doctors out of  the State quota of 699 have almost completed the first semester.  It is submitted that therefore, alternatively it is prayed to observe                                                                     22   that the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court  may not affect the admission already granted and may not affect  those in­service candidates who are already admitted prior to  filing of the petition / impugned judgment and order passed by  the High Court;  4.   The applicant of IA No.61442 of 2020 – GMS Class II  Medical   Officer’s   Association   and   Association   of   in­service  Government Medical Officers in the State of Gujarat are as such  aggrieved by the Public Notice dated 28.02.2019, as amended by  a Corrigendum dated 10.03.2019, wherein Medical Council of  India has permitted the conversion of Diploma seats into Degree  seats on the ground of doctrine of Legitimate Expectation and on  the ground that the same is in teeth of and to bypass the order  passed by this Court dated 19.5.2017 in the matter of Special  Leave Petition (Civil) No.31395 of 2017. It is submitted that in the  aforesaid case this Court directed the State of Gujarat to conduct  the counselling keeping in view the regulation which provides for  50% of seats to be reserved in the Post­graduate Diploma Courses  for Medical Officers in the government service who have served for  at least three years in remote and/or difficult areas. It is the case                                                                 23   on behalf of those in­service Medical Officers working in the  Government Colleges in the State of Gujarat that by the aforesaid  vested rights in favour of those in­service candidates and to avail  50% reservation in Post­graduate Diploma Courses have been  taken away. It is their case that what cannot be done directly,  shall not be permitted to be done obliquely. It is also their case  that so far as the State of Gujarat is concerned, there is no  provision for giving 30% incentive for Post­graduate Degree  Courses displaced in Clause 9(IV) of the MCI Regulations, 2000. It  is submitted that therefore, on one hand Diploma seats are being  decreased and on the other hand there is no provision for  providing incentive marks in the Degree Courses to the in­service  Medical Officers, who have worked in rural areas. It is submitted  that the applicant has already filed writ petition before the  Gujarat High Court being Special Civil Application No.5773 of  2019 challenging the vires of Rule 6 of the Gujarat Professional  Post­graduate Medical Educational Courses          (Regulation of  Admission) Rules, 2018 as well as conversion of Diploma seats  into Degree seats and the same is pending;                                                                   24   4.1.         Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respective  writ petitioners – in­service doctors have made the following  submissions in respect of their alternative prayer/prayers to  declare Regulation 9, more particularly, Regulation 9(IV) and  9(VII) of the MCI Regulations, 2000, as arbitrary, discriminatory  and violative of Article 14 and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India  and also ultra vires the provisions of the Indian Medical Council  Act, 1956;  4.2    That so far as the State of Tamil Nadu is concerned, it is  submitted that since the year 1989, the State of Tamil Nadu has  had a policy of providing a separate source of entry to in­service  candidates to the extent of 50% of the State seats in degree  courses. Further, since the year 2007, by way of a Government  Order, the State of Tamil Nadu has also provided for preferential  weightage to those in­service candidates "

Page | 1 FACTS:   3.     Sandeep Sharma (deceased), was a resident of District Sikar in  Rajasthan. He was travelling in a car bearing registration no. UP 65  AA 7100 from Ghazipur to Varanasi (Uttar Pradesh) on the night of  25.03.2009 along with his friend Sanjeev Kapoor (Respondent No. 2)  and two other occupants. Sanjeev Kapoor, who was also its owner,  was driving the car when at about 10:20PM near village Atroli, a truck  coming from the opposite side struck the car as a result of which all  the occupants suffered injuries. Sandeep along with the other injured­  occupants was rushed to the District Hospital in Ghazipur at around  11:55PM, but was subsequently referred to the Institute of Medical  Sciences and S.S. Hospital, BHU, Varanasi on 26.03.2009 considering  the severity and multiplicity of his injuries. Although he was  discharged on 16.04.2009 and brought back to Rajasthan, it appears  that   Sandeep    kept   experiencing   one   after   another   medical  complications, and remained hospitalized at the Jain Hospital in  Jaipur and later the Joshi Nursing Home at Sikar. His injuries  eventually got the better of him and Sandeep Sharma passed away on  10.12.2009.   4.     At the time of death, the deceased was aged 34 years and was an  income tax assessee with an Employees Provident Fund (EPF)  account. He was employed in Mumbai at Kelvin Ess Vee Textiles as a                                                                  Page | 2 Sales Officer on regular basis. He left behind a widow, two minor  children and a mother; all of whom were dependent on him.   5.   Sandeep’s dependents filed a claim petition for Rs 60,94,000  (Rupees sixty lakhs and ninety­four thousand) on 26.08.2010 alleging,  inter alia, that he died as a result of the injuries suffered in the above­  mentioned accident of 25.03.2009, which occurred due to the rash  and negligent driving of Sanjeev Kapoor who was the owner­cum­  driver of the car in which Sandeep was travelling. Sanjeev Kapoor  (hereinafter, “owner­cum­driver”) and the insurer of the car ­ New  India Assurance Co. Ltd. (hereinafter, “insurance company”) were  impleaded as party respondents.   6.   The owner­cum­driver in his written statement admitted that the  deceased had suffered multiple injuries in the accident while travelling  in the car with him but he disowned responsibility for the accident by  asserting that it was the truck which was coming from the opposite  side at a very fast speed, and was being driven in a rash and negligent  manner. Since all the four occupants of the car had been injured, they  were unable to note the registration details of the truck which made a  hasty get­away towards Ghazipur.   7.   The insurance company in its separate written statement took  the preliminary objection that as per the police investigation and first                                                                     Page | 3 information report, the accident was caused by an unknown truck  which hit the car No. UP­65­AA­7100 and, therefore, the claim petition  filed against the owner of the car or its insurer was contrary to law.  The factual averments made in the Claim Petition were denied for  want of knowledge.   8.    In reaching its verdict, the Tribunal relied upon the statement of  the eye­witness Ritesh Pandey (AW­3), according to whom Sanjeev  Kapoor was driving the car at a very fast speed when it overtook a  vehicle and collided head­on against the oncoming truck. The  Tribunal,    thus,    assigned   liability    for    the   accident    upon     the  respondents     and    partly    allowed      the    Claim    Petition   with    a  compensation of Rs. 16,08,000 (Rupees sixteen lakhs and eight  thousand).   9.    Both the insurance company and the appellant­claimants filed  their respective appeals before the High Court. Through judgment  dated 23.07.2018, the High Court set aside the Tribunal’s award and  dismissed the claim petition for the reasons that first, Ritesh Pandey  (AW­3) had failed to report the accident to the jurisdictional police. He  was   apparently      introduced    by       the    claimants   only     to   seek  compensation. Second, the FIR had been lodged by the owner­cum­  driver, Sanjeev Kapoor, who would not have done so had he been at  fault or driving rashly. Third, the assertion of Ritesh Pandey (AW­3)                                                                            Page | 4 that he took the injured to hospital was not proved from the record of  the Government Hospital, Ghazipur which revealed that Sandeep  Sharma      was   brought   to   the   hospital   by   Sub­Inspector   Sah  Mohammed.   CONTENTIONS:   10.   We have heard learned counsel for parties and have perused the  Original Record of the Tribunal and the High Court. The two questions  which fall for determination are whether the accident was caused due  to rash and negligent driving of the car driver—Sanjeev Kapoor and  whether Ritesh Pandey (AW­3) is a reliable witness or not?   ANALYSIS:   11.   At the outset, it may be mentioned that some material facts  which have a direct bearing on the fate of this case, have escaped  notice of the High Court. The FIR was not registered by Sanjeev  Kapoor (owner­cum­driver of the car) as assumed by the High Court.  Instead, as a matter of fact, the FIR No. 120/09 (Exh 1) was registered  on the basis of information furnished by one, Pradeep Kumar  Aggarwal, son of Bal Krishan Das Aggarwal – a resident of District  Varanasi. The contents of this report reveal that Sanjeev Kapoor was  travelling in the Wagon R Car No. UP­65­AA­7100 along with three  other occupants. While returning from Ghazipur to Varanasi, a truck                                                                    Page | 5 which was being driven rashly and at a fast speed, struck against the  car and then sped away towards Ghazipur. The number of the truck  could not be noticed as it was dark. The car was badly damaged.  Various people gathered at the spot who took out the injured from the  car. It is specifically mentioned that all the injured were taken to the  hospital for treatment where Rahul Singh @ Chotu Singh passed­away  whereas Sandeep Sharma was referred to BHU Varanasi for treatment.  The FIR was lodged on 27.03.2009 and a slightly illegible part thereof  indicates that Sanjeev Kapoor and the informant were known to each  other. The informant himself had not witnessed the accident and  apparently lodged the FIR based on hearsay information.   12.   Importantly, the owner­cum­driver though denied responsibility  of the accident through his written statement but chose not to enter  the witness box in his defence. The insurance company, on the other  hand, relied upon the contents of the FIR and the ‘Investigation  Report’ to aver that the accident took place due to rash and negligent  driving of the truck driver alone. But we find that the ‘investigation  report’ (Exh. 2) dated 05.05.2009 merely recites that the registration  number of the offending truck could not be ascertained despite best  efforts.   13.   At this juncture, we may refer to the statement of Ritesh Pandey  (AW­3). This witness is a resident of Ghazipur in Uttar Pradesh. He is                                                                  Page | 6 neither related to the deceased nor was he remotely connected to the  family of the deceased. He hailed from a different State and lived in a  faraway place. There is nothing to suggest that the witness had any  business dealings with the deceased or his family. He has deposed  that he was travelling in his own car on the date of the incident on the  same route when the owner­cum­driver of the Wagon R car carelessly  overtook him at a very high speed. He has further deposed that a  truck coming from the opposite side collided with the car. Various  persons gathered at the place of accident and four persons trapped  inside the car were taken out, three of whom were unconscious and  the fourth was its driver ­ Sanjeev Kapoor. The witness has further  deposed that he took all the four injured persons to the District  Hospital, Ghazipur where some of them were referred to Institute of  Medical Sciences and S.S. Hospital, BHU, Varanasi.   14.   Most importantly, the only question asked to this witness in  cross­examination is whether the truck could be spotted and whether  he was able to note the registration number of the truck. The witness  has candidly admitted that he could not see the registration number of  the truck. No other question was asked to this witness in the cross­  examination. While the Tribunal believed Ritesh Pandey (AW­3) and  accepted the claim petition in part, the High Court, for the reasons  which are already briefly noticed, has disbelieved him on the premise                                                                  Page | 7 that the deceased was brought to the hospital by SI Sah Mohammed  and not by Ritesh Pandey (AW­3). The entire case, thus, effectively  hinges upon the trustworthiness of the statement of this witness.   FINDINGS:   15.   It is not in dispute that the accident took place near Ghazipur  and that numerous people had assembled at the spot. Some bystander  would obviously have informed the police also. While the contents of  the FIR as well as the statement of Ritesh Pandey (AW­3) leave no  room to doubt that the injured were taken to the Hospital by private  persons (and not by the police), it is quite natural that the police  would also have reached the Government hospital at Ghazipur and,  therefore, it was mentioned that Sandeep Sharma was brought­in by  SI Sah Mohammed.   16.   It is commonplace for most people to be hesitant about being  involved in legal proceedings and they therefore do not volunteer to  become witnesses. Hence, it is highly likely that the name of Ritesh  Pandey or other persons who accompanied the injured to the hospital  did not find mention in the medical record. There is nothing on record  to suggest that the police reached the site of the accident or carried  the injured to the hospital. The statement of AW­3, therefore, acquires  significance as, according to him, he brought the injured in his car to                                                                  Page | 8 the hospital. Ritesh Pandey (AW­3) acted as a good samaritan and a  responsible citizen, and the High Court ought not to have disbelieved  his testimony based merely on a conjecture. It is necessary to reiterate  the independence and benevolence of AW­3. Without any personal  interest or motive, he assisted both the deceased by taking him to the  hospital and later his family by expending time and effort to depose  before the Tribunal.   17.   It is quite natural that such a person who had accompanied the  injured to the hospital for immediate medical aid, could not have  simultaneously gone to the police station to lodge the FIR. The High  Court ought not to have drawn any adverse inference against the  witness for his failure to report the matter to Police. Further, as the  police had themselves reached the hospital upon having received  information about the accident, there was perhaps no occasion for  AW­3 to lodge a report once again to the police at a later stage either.   18.   Unfortunately, the approach of the High Court was not sensitive  enough to appreciate the turn of events at the spot, or the appellant­  claimants’ hardship in tracing witnesses and collecting information for  an accident which took place many hundreds of kilometers away in an  altogether different State. Close to the facts of the case in hand, this  Court in Parmeshwari v. Amir Chand1, viewed that:  1                   (2011) 11 SCC 635                                                                   Page | 9       “12. The other ground on which the High Court dismissed the case       was by way of disbelieving the testimony of Umed Singh, PW 1.       Such disbelief of the High Court is totally conjectural. Umed       Singh is not related to the appellant but as a good citizen,       Umed Singh extended his help to the appellant by helping her       to reach the doctor's chamber in order to ensure that an       injured woman gets medical treatment. The evidence of Umed       Singh cannot be disbelieved just because he did not file a       complaint    himself.   We   are   constrained   to     repeat    our       observation that the total approach of the High Court,       unfortunately, was not sensitised enough to appreciate the       plight of the victim.        xxx        15. In a situation of this nature, the Tribunal has rightly taken a       holistic view of the matter. It was necessary to be borne in mind       that strict proof of an accident caused by a particular bus in       a particular manner may not be possible to be done by the       claimants. The claimants were merely to establish their case on the       touchstone of preponderance of probability. The standard of proof       beyond reasonable doubt could not have been applied.”                                                       (emphasis supplied)  19.    The failure of the respondents to cross examine the solitary eye­  witness or confront him with their version, despite adequate  opportunity, must lead to an inference of tacit admission on their part.  They did not even suggest the witness that he was siding with the  claimants. The High Court has failed to appreciate the legal effect of  this absence of cross­examination of a crucial witness.                                                                          Page | 10 20.    The importance of cross­examination has been elucidated on  several occasions by this Court, including by a Constitution Bench in  Kartar Singh v. State of Punjab2, which laid down as follows:         “278.    Section 137 of the Evidence Act defines what cross­       examination means and Sections 139 and 145 speak of the mode of       cross­examination with reference to the documents as well as oral       evidence. It is the jurisprudence of law that cross­examination       is an acid­test of the truthfulness of the statement made by a       witness on oath in examination­in­chief, the objects of which       are:       (1) to destroy or weaken the evidentiary value of the witness of his       adversary;       (2) to elicit facts in favour of the cross­examining lawyer's client from       the mouth of the witness of the adversary party;       (3) to show that the witness is unworthy of belief by impeaching the       credit of the said witness;       and the questions to be addressed in the course of cross­       examination are to test his veracity; to discover who he is       and what is his position in life; and to shake his credit by       injuring his character.        279. The identity of the witness is necessary in the normal trial of       cases to achieve the above objects and the right of confrontation is       one of the fundamental guarantees so that he could guard himself       from being victimised by any false and invented evidence that may       be tendered by the adversary party.”                                                           (emphasis supplied)  21.    Relying upon Kartar Singh (supra), in a MACT case this Court    2                      (1994) 3 SCC 569                                                                           Page | 11 in Sunita v. Rajasthan State Road Transport Corporation 3  considered the effect of non­examination of the pillion rider as a  witness in a claim petition filed by the deceased of the motorcyclist  and held as follows:       “30. Clearly, the evidence given by Bhagchand withstood the     respondents' scrutiny and the respondents were unable to shake his     evidence. In turn, the High Court has failed to take note of the     absence of cross examination of this witness by the respondents,     leave alone the Tribunal's finding on the same, and instead,     deliberated on the reliability of Bhagchand's (A.D.2) evidence from     the viewpoint of him not being named in the list of eye witnesses in     the criminal proceedings, without even mentioning as to why such     absence from the list is fatal to the case of the appellants. This     approach of the High Court is mystifying, especially in light of this     Court's   observation   [as   set   out   in Parmeshwari (supra)    and     reiterated in Mangla Ram (supra)] that the strict principles of proof in     a criminal case will not be applicable in a claim for compensation     under the Act and further, that the standard to be followed in such     claims is one of preponderance of probability rather than one of     proof beyond reasonable doubt. There is nothing in the Act to     preclude citing of a witness in motor accident claim who has not     been named in the list of witnesses in the criminal case. What is     essential is that the opposite party should get a fair     opportunity to cross examine the concerned witness. Once     that is done, it will not be open to them to complain about     any prejudice caused to them. If there was any doubt to be     cast on the veracity of the witness, the same should have     come out in cross examination, for which opportunity was 3                    (2019) SCC Online SC 195.                                                                         Page | 12       granted to the respondents by the Tribunal.       xxx       32. The High Court has not held that the respondents were       successful in challenging the witnesses' version of events, despite       being given the opportunity to do so. The High Court accepts that the       said witness (A.D.2) was cross examined by the respondents but       nevertheless reaches a conclusion different from that of the Tribunal,       by selectively overlooking the deficiencies in the respondent's case,       without any proper reasoning.”                                                        (emphasis supplied)  22.    Equally, we are concerned over the failure of the High Court to  be cognizant of the fact that strict principles of evidence and  standards of proof like in a criminal trial are inapplicable in MACT  claim cases. The standard of proof in such like matters is one of  preponderance of probabilities, rather than beyond reasonable doubt.  One needs to be mindful that the approach and role of Courts while  examining evidence in accident claim cases ought not to be to find  fault with non­examination of some best eye­witnesses, as may  happen in a criminal trial; but, instead should be only to analyze the  material placed on record by the parties to ascertain whether the  claimant’s version is more likely than not true. A somewhat similar  situation arose in Dulcina Fernandes v. Joaquim Xavier Cruz4  wherein this Court reiterated that:         “7. It would hardly need a mention that the plea of negligence on the       part of the first respondent who was driving the pick­up van as set  4                      (2013) 10 SCC 646.                                                                        Page | 13       up by the claimants was required to be decided by the learned       Tribunal on the touchstone of preponderance of probabilities       and certainly not on the basis of proof beyond reasonable       doubt. (Bimla Devi v. Himachal RTC [(2009) 13 SCC 530 : (2009) 5       SCC (Civ) 189 : (2010) 1 SCC (Cri) 1101] )”                                                      (emphasis supplied) 23.     The observation of the High Court that the author of the FIR (as  per its judgment, the owner­cum­driver) had not been examined as a  witness, and hence adverse inference ought to be drawn against the  appellant­claimants, is wholly misconceived and misdirected. Not only  is the owner­cum­driver not the author of the FIR, but instead he is  one of the contesting respondents in the Claim Petition who, along  with insurance company, is an interested party with a pecuniary stake  in the result of the case. If the owner­cum­driver of the car were  setting up a defence plea that the accident was a result of not his but  the truck driver’s carelessness or rashness, then the onus was on him  to step into the witness box and explain as to how the accident had  taken place. The fact that Sanjeev Kapoor chose not to depose in  support of what he has pleaded in his written statement, further  suggests that he was himself at fault. The High Court, therefore, ought  not to have shifted the burden of proof.   24.    Further, little reliance can be placed on the contents of the FIR  (Exh.­1) , and it is liable to be discarded for more than one reasons.                                                                    Page | 14 First, the author of the FIR, that is, Praveen Kumar Aggarwal does not  claim to have witnessed the accident himself. His version is hearsay  and cannot be relied upon. Second, it appears from the illegible part of  the FIR that the informant had some closeness with the owner­cum­  driver of the car and there is thus a strong possibility that his version  was influenced or at the behest of Sanjeev Kapoor. Third, the FIR was  lodged two days after the accident, on 27.03.2009. The FIR recites  that some of the injured including Sandeep Sharma were referred to  BHU, Varanasi for treatment, even though as per the medical report  this took place only on 26.03.2009, the day after the accident.  Therefore the belated FIR appears to be an afterthought attempt to  absolve Sanjeev Kapoor from his criminal or civil liabilities. Contrarily,  the statement of AW­3 does not suffer from any evil of suspicion and is  worthy of reliance. The Tribunal rightly relied upon his statement and  decided issue No. 1 in favour of the claimants. The reasoning given by  the High Court to disbelieve Ritesh Pandey AW­3, on the other hand,  cannot sustain and is liable to be overturned. We hold accordingly.   25.   Adverting   to   the   claimants’   appeal   for   enhancement    of  compensation, we are of the view that no effective argument could be  raised on their behalf as to how the compensation assessed by the  Tribunal was inadequate, except that in view of the authoritative  pronouncement of this Court in National Insurance Co Ltd v.                                                                  Page | 15 Pranay Sethi5, the claimants are entitled to an increase of 40%  towards annual dependency on account of ‘future prospects’ given the  undisputed age of the deceased. Their appeal to that extent deserves  to be allowed.  CONCLUSION:   26.     In light of the above discussion, the judgment under appeal of  the High Court is set aside and the appellants are held entitled to  compensation as awarded by the Tribunal, besides 40% addition in  the annual income of the deceased towards ‘future prospects’.     The  Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Sikar (Rajasthan) is directed to re­  calculate the compensation amount accordingly. The appellants are  held entitled to interest @ 8.5%, as per the Tribunal’s award, on the  entire amount of compensation. The Tribunal shall re­calculate the  compensation within one month and the insurance company shall  deposit the same within one month thereafter.

Leave granted.            2.             This appeal takes exception to the judgment and order            dated 2.1.2017 passed by the High Court of Delhi at New Delhi Signature Not Verified  Digitally signed by            (for short, “the High Court”) in R.S.A. No. 391/2016, whereby the DEEPAK SINGH Date: 2020.06.05 16:28:59 IST Reason:               High Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Civil Judge–05,                                   2   Central District, Tis Hazari Courts, Delhi, dated 6.1.2016 in C.S.  No.   950/2014     allowing   the     application   filed   by   the  respondents/defendants for rejection of the plaint under Order  VII Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (for short, “the  CPC”), instituted by the appellant/plaintiff.       The Additional  District & Sessions Judge, Central, Tis Hazari Courts, Delhi, vide  order dated 23.7.2016 in R.C.A. No. 61794/2016 had also  affirmed the order of rejecting the plaint. The appellant had filed  the stated suit on 23.2.2005 for a decree for rendition of true and  correct accounts in respect of the interest/commission charged  and deducted by the respondent­Bank relating to current  account No. CCM 20225 of the appellant for the period between  1.4.1997 and 31.12.2000 and also for recovery of the excess  amount charged by the respondent­Bank consequent to rendition  of accounts with interest at the rate of 18% per annum from the  date of deduction including interest pendente lite realization of  the amount and future interest.  3.    The plaint came to be rejected by the trial Court under  Order VII Rule 11(d) of the CPC on the ground that it was barred  by law of limitation, as it was filed beyond the period of three  years prescribed in Article 113 of the Limitation Act, 1963 (for                                      3   short, “the 1963 Act”), as applicable to the present case, from the  date when the right to sue accrued to the appellant in October,  2000. The entire discussion of the trial Court in that regard can  be traced to paragraphs 10 and 11, which read thus: ­          ‘‘10. As stated above the plaintiff by way of present         suit has sought two reliefs i.e. rendition of account         and repayment of excess money. Limitation Act,         1963 does not provide any specific article with         regard to time period within which accounts can be         sought by party from its bank. As such, Article 113         of Limitation Act came into picture which provides a         limitation period of three years for suits for which no         limitation period is provided, from the date when         right to sue accrues.         11. In the present case in hand, as per averments         made by the plaintiff in his plaint, the facility was         availed by the plaintiff from the defendants till         October 2000. Further as per averments made in the         plaint the alleged amount so charged by the         defendant from the plaintiff, in excess from agreed         amount, was till October, 2000. As such, at best can         be said right to sue accrues in favour of the plaintiff         in October, 2000. Considering the law as stated in         above paragraph, plaintiff could have filed the         present suit i.e. for rendition of account and         repayment of excess amount till October 2003. ...”   After so observing, the trial Court considered the submission of  the appellant that the cause of action had accrued to the  appellant only upon rejection of the representation by the  respondent­Bank entailing in refusal or denial of liability,  communicated to the appellant vide letters dated 19.9.2002 and  3.6.2003 and after the final legal notice was served upon the                                    4   respondents on 7.1.2005. That contention has been rejected by  adverting to the decision of the same High Court in C.P. Kapur  vs. The Chairman & Ors.1, wherein it is held that exchange of  correspondence between the parties cannot extend the limitation  period for institution of a suit, once the right to sue had accrued,  which in this case had accrued in October, 2000, as has been  asserted even in the plaint.       Whereas, the suit was filed in  February, 2005 beyond the period of three years from the date on  which right to sue accrued to the appellant, as prescribed in  Article 113 of the 1963 Act. The view so taken by the trial Court  commended to the District Court in first appeal and also the High  Court in second appeal, which judgment is the subject matter of  challenge in the present appeal.  4.     We have heard Mr. Nischal Kumar Neeraj, learned counsel  for the appellant and Mr. Anuj Jain, learned counsel for the  respondents.  5.    Be it noted that the appellant had relied on Articles 2, 3 and  22 of the 1963 Act to urge that the suit filed in February, 2005  was within limitation. This plea, however, did not impress the  trial Court, the first appellate Court or the High Court.       The  1 (2013) 198 DLT 56                                         5   Courts proceeded on the basis that Article 113 is attracted in the  facts of the present case, as the reliefs claimed by the appellant  were not covered under any specific Article with regard to time  period within which accounts can be sought by party from its  bank, as noted by the trial Court in paragraph 10 of its judgment  reproduced above.  6.    The central question is: whether the plaint as filed by the  appellant could have been rejected by invoking Order VII Rule  11(d) of the CPC? Indeed, Order VII Rule 11 of the CPC gives  ample power to the Court to reject the plaint, if from the  averments in the plaint, it is evident that the suit is barred by  any law including the law of limitation. This position is no more  res integra. We may usefully refer to the decision of this Court in  Ram Prakash Gupta vs. Rajiv Kumar Gupta & Ors.2.                   In  paragraph Nos. 13 to 20 of the reported decision, the Court  observed as follows: ­           “13. As per Order 7 Rule 11, the plaint is liable to          be rejected in the following cases:             “(a)     where it does not disclose a cause of          action;              (b)     where the relief claimed is undervalued,                      and the plaintiff, on being required by the                      court to correct the valuation within a   2 (2007) 10 SCC 59                               6            time to be fixed by the court, fails to do          so;    (c)   where the relief claimed is properly          valued but the plaint is written upon          paper insufficiently stamped, and the          plaintiff, on being required by the court to          supply the requisite stamp paper within a          time to be fixed by the court, fails to do          so;    (d)   where the suit appears from the          statement in the plaint to be barred by          any law;    (e)   where it is not filed in duplicate;    (f)   where the plaintiff fails to comply with the          provisions of Rule 9.” 14. In Saleem Bhai v. State of Maharashtra [(2003) 1 SCC 557] it was held with reference to Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code that          “9. … the relevant facts which need to be          looked into for deciding an application          thereunder are the averments in the          plaint. The trial court can exercise the          power … at any stage of the suit — before          registering the plaint or after issuing          summons to the defendant at any time          before the conclusion of the trial. For the          purposes of deciding an application under          Clauses (a) and (d) of Rule 11 of Order 7          CPC, the averments in the plaint are          germane; the pleas taken by the defendant          in the written statement would be wholly          irrelevant at that stage,…” (SCC p. 560,          para 9). 15. In I.T.C. Ltd. v. Debts Recovery Appellate Tribunal [(1998) 2 SCC 70] it was held that the basic question to be decided while dealing with an application filed under Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code is whether a real cause of action has been set out in the plaint or something purely illusory has been stated with a view to get out of Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code. 16. “The trial court must remember that if on a meaningful—no formal—reading of the plaint it is manifestly vexatious and meritless in the sense of                              7   not disclosing a clear right to sue, it should exercise its power under Order 7 Rule 11 CPC taking care to see that the ground mentioned therein is fulfilled. If clever drafting has created the illusion of a cause of action, [it has to be nipped] in the bud at the first hearing by examining the party searchingly under Order 10 CPC.” (See T. Arivandandam v. T.V. Satyapal [(1977) 4 SCC 467], SCC p. 468.). 17. It is trite law that not any particular plea has to be considered, and the whole plaint has to be read. As was observed by this Court in Roop Lal Sathi v. Nachhattar Singh Gill [(1982) 3 SCC 487], only a part of the plaint cannot be rejected and if no cause of action is disclosed, the plaint as a whole must be rejected. 18. In Raptakos Brett & Co. Ltd. v. Ganesh Property [(1998) 7 SCC 184] it was observed that the averments in the plaint as a whole have to be seen to find out whether Clause (d) of Rule 11 of Order 7 was applicable. 19. In Sopan Sukhdeo Sable v. Asstt. Charity Commr. [(2004) 3 SCC 137] this Court held thus: (SCC pp. 146­47, para 15)       “15. There         cannot       be        any       compartmentalisation,              dissection,       segregation and inversions of the language of       various paragraphs in the plaint. If such a       course is adopted it would run counter to       the cardinal canon of interpretation       according to which a pleading has to be read       as a whole to ascertain its true import. It is       not permissible to cull out a sentence or a       passage and to read it out of the context in       isolation. Although it is the substance and       not merely the form that has to be looked       into, the pleading has to be construed as it       stands without addition or subtraction or       words or change of its apparent grammatical       sense. The intention of the party concerned       is to be gathered primarily from the tenor       and terms of his pleadings taken as a whole.       At the same time it should be borne in mind       that no pedantic approach should be                                        8                   adopted to defeat justice on hair­splitting                 technicalities.”          20. For our purpose, Clause (d) is relevant. It          makes it clear that if the plaint does not contain          necessary averments relating to limitation, the same          is liable to be rejected. For the said purpose, it is the          duty of the person who files such an application to          satisfy the court that the plaint does not disclose          how the same is in time. In order to answer the said          question, it is incumbent on the part of the court to          verify the entire plaint. Order 7 Rule 12 mandates          where a plaint is rejected, the court has to record          the order to that effect with the reasons for such          order.”  On the same lines, this Court in Church of Christ Charitable  Trust & Educational Charitable Society vs. Ponniamman  Educational Trust3, observed as follows: ­            “10 … It is clear from the above that where the plaint          does not disclose a cause of action, the relief claimed is          undervalued and not corrected within the time allowed by          the court, insufficiently stamped and not rectified within          the time fixed by the court, barred by any law, failed to          enclose the required copies and the plaintiff fails to          comply with the provisions of Rule 9, the court has no          other option except to reject the same. A reading of the          above provision also makes it clear that power under          Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code can be exercised at any stage          of the suit either before registering the plaint or after the          issuance of summons to the defendants or at any time          before the conclusion of the trial.           11. This position was explained by this Court in          Saleem Bhai vs. State of Maharashtra, (2003) 1 SCC 557,          in which, while considering Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code,          it was held as under: (SCC p. 560, para 9)                       “9. A perusal of Order 7 Rule 11 CPC                      makes it clear that the relevant facts                      which need to be looked into for deciding                      an application thereunder are the 3 (2012) 8 SCC 706                              9            averments in the plaint. The trial court          can exercise the power under Order 7 Rule          11 CPC at any stage of the suit — before          registering the plaint or after issuing          summons to the defendant at any time          before the conclusion of the trial. For the          purposes of deciding an application under          clauses (a) and (d) of Rule 11 of Order 7          CPC, the averments in the plaint are          germane; the pleas taken by the defendant          in the written statement would be wholly          irrelevant at that stage, therefore, a          direction to file the written statement          without deciding the application under          Order 7 Rule 11 CPC cannot but be          procedural irregularity touching the          exercise of jurisdiction by the trial court.”  It is clear that in order to consider Order 7 Rule 11, the court has to look into the averments in the plaint and the same can be exercised by the trial court at any stage of the suit. It is also clear that the averments in the written statement are immaterial and it is the duty of the Court to scrutinize the averments/pleas in the plaint. In other words, what needs to be looked into in deciding such an application are the averments in the plaint. At that stage, the pleas taken by the defendant in the written statement are wholly irrelevant and the matter is to be decided only on the plaint averments. These principles have been reiterated in Raptakos Brett & Co. Ltd. vs. Ganesh Property, (1998) 7 SCC 184 and Mayar (H.K.) Ltd. vs. Vessel M.V. Fortune Express, (2006) 3 SCC 100.  12. It is also useful to refer the judgment in T. Arivandandam vs. T.V. Satyapal, (1977) 4 SCC 467, wherein while considering the very same provision i.e. Order 7 Rule 11 and the duty of the trial court in considering such application, this Court has reminded the trial Judges with the following observation: (SCC p. 470, para 5)           “5. … The learned Munsif must remember          that if on a meaningful – not formal –          reading of the plaint it is manifestly          vexatious, and meritless, in the sense of          not disclosing a clear right to sue, he          should exercise his power under Order 7,          Rule 11 C.P.C. taking care to see that the                                           10                         ground mentioned therein is fulfilled. And,                       if clever drafting has created the illusion of                       a cause of action, nip it in the bud at the                       first hearing by examining the party                       searchingly under Order 10, C.P.C. An                       activist    Judge    is   the    answer     to                       irresponsible law suits. The trial courts                       would insist imperatively on examining                       the party at the first hearing so that bogus                       litigation can be shot down at the earliest                       stage. The Penal Code is also resourceful                       enough to meet such men, (Chapter XI)                       and must be triggered against them.”           It is clear that if the allegations are vexatious and          meritless and not disclosing a clear right or material(s) to          sue, it is the duty of the trial Judge to exercise his power          under Order 7 Rule 11. If clever drafting has created the          illusion of a cause of action as observed by Krishna Iyer          J., in the above referred decision, it should be nipped in          the bud at the first hearing by examining the parties          under Order 10 of the Code.”  We may also advert to the exposition of this Court in Madanuri  Sri Rama Chandra Murthy vs. Syed Jalal4. In paragraph 7 of  the said decision, this Court has succinctly restated the legal  position as follows: ­           “7.    The plaint can be rejected under Order 7 Rule 11 if          conditions enumerated in the said provision are fulfilled.          It is needless to observe that the power under Order 7          Rule 11, CPC can be exercised by the Court at any stage          of the suit. The relevant facts which need to be looked          into for deciding the application are the averments of the          plaint only. If on an entire and meaningful reading of the          plaint, it is found that the suit is manifestly vexatious and          meritless in the sense of not disclosing any right to sue,          the court should exercise power under Order 7 Rule 11          CPC. Since the power conferred on the Court to terminate          civil action at the threshold is drastic, the conditions          enumerated under Order 7 Rule 11 CPC to the exercise of  4 (2017) 13 SCC 174                                     11           power of rejection of plaint have to be strictly adhered to.         The averments of the plaint have to be read as a whole to         find out whether the averments disclose a cause of action         or whether the suit is barred by any law. It is needless to         observe that the question as to whether the suit is barred         by any law, would always depend upon the facts and         circumstances of each case. The averments in the written         statement as well as the contentions of the defendant are         wholly immaterial while considering the prayer of the         defendant for rejection of the plaint. Even when the         allegations made in the plaint are taken to be correct as a         whole on their face value, if they show that the suit is         barred by any law, or do not disclose cause of action, the         application for rejection of plaint can be entertained and         the power under Order 7 Rule 11 CPC can be exercised. If         clever drafting of the plaint has created the illusion of a         cause of action, the court will nip it in the bud at the         earliest so that bogus litigation will end at the earlier         stage.”  Keeping in mind the well settled legal position, we may now  proceed to analyse the averments in the plaint, as filed by the  appellant, to discern whether it was a fit case for rejection of the  plaint under Order VII Rule 11(d) of the CPC. As noticed from  the trial Court judgment, it is evident that the trial Court did not  make any attempt to analyse the plaint in the manner predicated  in the aforesaid decisions. Even the District Court dealing with  first appeal and the High Court with second appeal omitted to do  so. It is the bounden duty of the Court to examine the plaint as a  whole and not selected averments therein. For that, we need to  advert to the averments in the plaint. Paragraphs 8 to 15 of the                                      12   plaint, which according to us, are the relevant averments, read as  follows:­          ‘‘8.  That the facility as referred to in the foregoing paras         was extended with effect from 01.04.1997 and somewhere         in the month of July, 2000 it was noticed by the Plaintiff         that the Defendants were charging interest/commission         @ Rs.4/­ per thousand rupees on local cheques and         drafts in an arbitrary manner in violation of the         assurance given to the Plaintiff.          9.   That after the detection of the above         overcharging of interest/commission the Plaintiff         sent a letter to the Defendants on 21.07.2000         complaining about the overcharging and thereafter         the interest/commission was charged as per         assurance given.          10. That          the      amount      overcharged     as         commission/interest was not refunded to the Plaintiff and         the Plaintiff sent the following letters addressed to the         Bank i.e. General Manager and Senior Manager indicating         therein that amount overcharged should be refunded to         the Plaintiff with interest thereon: ­            Letter dated 12.10.2000, 24.10.2000, 30.10.2000,         7.11.2000,    24.12.2000,    01.03.2001,     28.03.2001,         22.5.2001 and 20.06.2001.      In all the above letters         requests were made to clarify as to how the commission         were calculated and deducted from the Plaintiff.           11. That the Assistant General Manager, Sh. P.S.         Bawa of Regional Office­B, Delhi vide letter dated         9.7.2001 informed the Plaintiff that the comments of         the Branch Office have been invited on the         representation of the Plaintiff in respect of the local         cheques/DDs discounted during the relevant period         and the matter will be decided as early as possible. No         progress was made in the matter and the Plaintiff had         to submit letter dated 31.10.2001 to the Hon’ble         Finance Minister, Govt. of India, New Delhi.                                    13           12. That the Defendants have charged interest for some         time for the actual number of days for the Defendants         remained out of funds.          13. That vide letter dated 08.05.2002, the Senior         Manager informed the Plaintiff that the cheques were         being purchased at the prevailing rates. That reply         was given to sidetrack the real issue in respect of         which letter dated 09.07.2001 was received from Shri         P.S. Bawa, Assistant General Manager of Regional         Office as referred to in the foregoing paras.          14. That, thereafter, the Plaintiff sent letters dated         12.07.2002, 22.09.2002, 24.3.2003 alongwith which the         details of the proposed/estimated excess amount charged         were given and it was requested that a sum of         Rs.31,57,484/­ approximately appears to have been         charged in excess of what should have been actually         charged and the exact amount should be calculated and         refunded to the Plaintiff. No reply was given by the Bank         to these letters.          15. That Senior Manager of the Defendant No. 2         vide letter dated 19.09.2002 had informed that         everything was done according to rules and the         matters need not to be pursued any further and         thereafter the Plaintiff sent another letter dated         03.06.2003.”                                          (emphasis supplied)  Again, in paragraph 28 of the plaint, it is stated as follows: ­          “28. That the cause of action to file the suit accrued in         favour of the Plaintiff and against the Defendants when         the illegal recoveries were noticed and letter dated         21.07.2000 was sent to the Defendants to clarify as to         how the interest was being calculated and recovered and         on various other dates when the letters were sent to the         Defendants with request for refund of the excess amounts         charged and on 9.7.2001 when assurance for proper         calculation and refund was conveyed to the Plaintiff and         on 8.5.2002, 12.7.2002 and 22.9.2002 when requests         were again made to settle the matter on 19.9.2002,         3.6.2003 and the cause of action arose on 23.12.2003         when the legal notice was served upon the Defendant and         on 28.12.2003 when the reply to the notice was received                                   14           and finally on 07.01.2005. When the legal notice for         rendition of accounts was served upon the Defendants         and the cause of action still subsists as the accounts         have not been rendered so far nor the excess amount         charged has been refunded by the Defendants.”  From the averments in the plaint, if read as a whole, it would  appear that the assertion of the appellant is that the respondents  had extended financial facility with effect from 1.4.1997 till  October, 2007, but somewhere in the month of July, 2000, the  appellant noticed that the respondents were unilaterally charging  interest/commission at the rate of Rs.4 per thousand rupees on  local cheques and drafts in an arbitrary manner in violation of  the assurance given to the appellant. Immediately thereafter, the  appellant wrote to the respondent­Bank vide letter dated  21.7.2000 for taking corrective steps in the matter.             Then  correspondence ensued between the parties in that regard and  the appellant was assured by the Regional Office of the  respondent­Bank that an appropriate decision will be taken at  the earliest.   The relevant assertion in that regard is found in  paragraph 11 of the plaint, wherein it is mentioned that the  Assistant General Manager ­ Shri P.S. Bawa of Regional Office­B,  Delhi, vide letter dated 9.7.2001 informed the appellant that  comments from the concerned Branch Office have been invited                                  15   and appropriate decision will be taken on its representation as  early as possible. Thereafter, on 8.5.2002, the Senior Manager of  the respondent­Bank informed the appellant that the cheques  were being purchased at the prevailing rates; which plea,  according to the appellant, was to deviate from the position  stated by the Assistant General Manager of Regional Office in his  letter dated 9.7.2001 referred to earlier.       Resultantly, the  appellant wrote to the officials of the respondent­Bank vide  letters dated 12.7.2002, 22.9.2002 and 24.3.2003. Notably, it is  averred in paragraph 15 of the plaint that the Senior Manager of  the respondent­Bank vide letter dated 19.9.2002 had informed  the appellant that everything was being done in accordance with  the rules and the appellant need not pursue the matter any  further. It is asserted that despite this intimation, the appellant  continued to correspond with the respondent­Bank with a  sanguine hope that the issue will be resolved at the appropriate  level by the Bank and finally issued a legal notice on 28.11.2003,  which was duly responded to by the respondent­Bank vide  Advocate’s letter dated 23.12.2003. Nevertheless, the appellant  gave another legal notice on 7.1.2005 and thereafter, proceeded  to file the subject suit in February, 2005.                                 16   7.   All these events have been reiterated in paragraph 28 of the  plaint, dealing with the cause of action for filing of the suit.  Indeed, the said paragraph opens with the expression “the cause  of action to file the suit accrued in favour of the plaintiff and  against the defendants when the illegal recoveries were noticed  and letter dated 21.7.2000 was sent to the defendants to clarify  as to how the interest was being calculated.”      This averment  cannot be read in isolation. As aforesaid, on reading the plaint  as a whole, it is seen that the gravamen of the case made out in  the plaint is that the appellant noticed the discrepancy in July,  2000 and immediately took up the matter with the officials of the  respondent­Bank at different levels and in response, the  Assistant General Manager of Regional Office of the Bank had  communicated in writing to the appellant vide letter dated  9.7.2001 that its representation was being examined and  comments of the Branch Office have been invited and after  receipt thereof the matter will be decided as early as possible. As  no further communication was received by the appellant, it had  to make a representation to the Finance Minister, Government of  India, vide letter dated 31.10.2001 and presumably because of  that, the appellant received a communication from the Senior                                  17   Manager vide letter dated 8.5.2002 informing the appellant that  the cheques were being purchased at the prevailing rates. This  stand taken by the Senior Manager was to side­track the issue  pending consideration before the Assistant General Manager,  Regional Office referred to in his letter dated 9.7.2001. The case  made out by the appellant is that no communication was  received by the appellant from the Assistant General Manager,  Regional Office and instead, for the first time it was informed vide  letter dated 19.9.2002 sent by the Senior Manager of the  respondent­Bank, that all actions taken by the Bank are as per  the rules and, therefore, the appellant need not correspond in  this regard any further. This response of the Bank could also be  regarded as a firm denial or refusal by the authorised official of  the Bank, giving rise to cause of action to sue the Bank.  8.   Thus understood, the letter dated 8.5.2002 sent by the  Senior Manager of the respondent­Bank, at best, be reckoned as  accrual of the cause of action to the appellant to sue the  respondent­Bank. It is then stated that the appellant received a  communication dated 19.9.2002, informing the appellant that it  should not carry on any further correspondence with the Bank                                 18   relating to the subject matter.      Until then, the appellant was  having a sanguine hope of favourable resolution of its claim  including by the Regional Office of the respondents.           The  appellant, therefore, had to send a legal notice on 28.11.2003, to  which the Bank responded on 23.12.2003.           Reckoning these  dates, the plaint filed on 23.2.2005 was within limitation, as  stated in paragraph 28 of the plaint. Resultantly, the question of  rejecting such a plaint under Order VII Rule 11(d) of the CPC did  not arise.  9.    The expression used in Article 113 of the 1963 Act is “when  the right to sue accrues”, which is markedly distinct from the  expression used in other Articles in First Division of the Schedule  dealing with suits, which unambiguously refer to the happening  of a specified event.   Whereas, Article 113 being a residuary  clause and which has been invoked by all the three Courts in this  case, does not specify happening of particular event as such, but  merely refers to the accrual of cause of action on the basis of  which the right to sue would accrue.  10.   Concededly, the expression used in Article 113 is distinct  from the expressions used in other Articles in the First Division                                  19   dealing with suits such as Article 58 (when the right to sue “first”  accrues), Articl"

This appeal is against a judgment and order dated 31-1-2018                           passed by the Karnataka High Court, disposing of the application of                           the appellant under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for                           quashing an order dated 27-12-2016 passed by the Additional Chief                           Metropolitan Magistrate III, Bengaluru City in PCR No.17214 of 2013,                           taking cognizance of a private complaint being PCR No.17214 of 2013 Signature Not Verified  Digitally signed by MAHABIR SINGH                          inter alia against the accused appellant, for offences punishable Date: 2020.06.18 17:41:15 IST Reason:                           under Sections 120-B, 220, 323, 330 348, 506B read with Section 34                                                                            2   of the Indian Penal Code.

The accused appellant is a police officer of the rank of  Superintendent of Police. On or about 10-8-2012, when the accused  appellant was posted as Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime),  Bangalore city, the Commissioner of Police, Bangalore passed an  order transferring a case being Crime No.12/2012 registered at the  Ulsoor Police Station, Bangalore, to the Central Crime Branch,  Bangalore.  4.

Thereafter, the Inspector of Police, being the 3 rd  accused took up investigation under the guidance of the Assistant  Commissioner of Police being the 2nd accused, with the assistance of  the Sub-Inspector of Police being the accused No.4.  6.

By an order dated 28-2-2013, the learned Additional  Chief Metropolitan Magistrate I, Bengaluru remanded the respondent  to police custody, observing that the respondent had not complained  of any ill-treatment by the Police.  10.      On 1-3-2013, the Investigating Officer seized a stolen car  being Tata Manza car which was parked on the road adjacent to the  respondent’s house, allegedly pursuant to a voluntary statement of  the respondent. Inquiry revealed that the car was related to Crime  No.110 of 2013 registered with HSR Layout police station.  11.      On or about 2-3-2013, K. M. Hussain, father of the respondent,  filed a Habeas Corpus Petition being WP(HC) No. 57 of 2013 in the  karnataka High Court at Bengaluru, seeking an order for production of  the respondent from alleged illegal detention. On 4-3-2013, the                                                                         5   learned Magistrate passed an order for medical examination of the  respondent in view of allegations made by the respondent and/or his  father, of ill-treatment of the respondent, by the Police. The  respondent was taken to Jayadev Institute of Cardiology and later to  Victoria hospital for check-up and treatment.      The doctors gave a  detailed report ruling out any abnormalities and injuries on the  respondent, after perusal of which, the learned 1 st Additional Chief  Metropolitan Magistrate, Bengaluru passed an order dated 4-3-2013,  observing that there were no abnormalities and injuries found on the  respondent.  12.    On 6-3-2013 the accused appellant, as Deputy Commissioner  of Police (CCB), Bangalore filed an affidavit in WP(HC) No.57 of 2013  in the Karnataka High Court at Bengaluru. An enquiry report was filed  along with the said affidavit, stating that the Investigating Officer had  apprehended the respondent, Sabir Hussain @ Uwaiz Hussain in  relation to Crime No.12/2012 registered in Halasuru Police Station, for  offence under Section 381 of IPC and produced him before the Court  of the jurisdictional Magistrate in accordance with law.  13.    By an order dated 8-03-2013, the Karnataka High Court  dismissed the Habeas Corpus Petition being WP(HC) No.57 of 2013  filed by the respondent’s father, observing inter alia that eight  criminal cases were pending against the respondent and that he had  been produced before the jurisdictional Magistrate in accordance with  law.                                                                       6   14.    On 18-3-2013, Crime No.110 of 2013 HSR Layout Police  Station was transferred to the Central Crime Branch.         After the  respondent was released from judicial custody, he filed the aforesaid  private complaint being P.C.R. No.17214 of 2013 against the accused  appellant and other police officials, in the Court of the learned IIIrd  Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate at Bengaluru alleging ill-  treatment and police excesses while the respondent was in police  custody from 27-2-2013 to 4-3-2013.  15.    By an order dated 27-12-2016,        the IIIrd Additional Chief  Metropolitan Magistrate, Bengaluru, was pleased to take cognizance  against the appellant in P.C.R. No. 17214 of 2013, even though no  previous sanction had been obtained from the Government. The  accused appellant filed Criminal Petition No.319 of 2017 under  Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in the Karnataka High  Court at Bengaluru inter alia   for quashing the order dated 27-12-  2016 in P.C.R. No.17214 of 2013.  16.    By the impugned order dated 31-1-2018, the Karnataka High  Court was pleased to hold that it was a well recognised principle of  law, that sanction was a legal requirement, which empowered the  Court to take cognizance of a private criminal complaint against a  public servant.   After recording its finding, as aforesaid, the High  Court proceeded to observe that the Magistrate had tentatively  opined that sanction was not necessary to proceed against the  accused appellant, having regard to the documents produced by the  complainant before him, and remanded the complaint back to the                                                                        7   Trial Court, with a direction on the accused appellant to appear before  the Trial Court and file an application under Section 245 of the Code  of Criminal Procedure for discharge. The Magistrate was directed to  pass an appropriate order on the application for discharge, if filed,  before recording evidence on the merits of the allegations.  17.    Being aggrieved by the aforesaid order dated 31-1-2018, to  the extent that the appellant has been remanded back to the learned  Magistrate and directed to file a discharge application under Section  245 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the appellant has filed this  appeal.  18.    The short question involved in this appeal is, whether the  learned Magistrate could, at all, have taken cognizance against the  appellant, in the private complaint being P.C.R No.17214 of 2013, in  the absence of sanction under Section 197 of the Code of Criminal  Procedure read with Section 170 of the Karnataka Police Act, 1963, as  amended by the Karnataka Police (Amendment) Act, 2013, and if not,  whether the High Court should have quashed the impugned order of  the Magistrate concerned, instead of remitting the complaint to the  Magistrate concerned and requiring the accused appellant to appear  before him and file an application for discharge.  19.    Section 170 of the Karnataka Police Act, 1963 provides as  follows:-    “170. Suits or prosecutions in respect of acts done under   colour of duty as aforesaid not to be entertained without   sanction of Government. – (1) In any case of alleged offence   by the Commissioner, a Magistrate, Police Officer or Reserve   Police Officer or other person, or of a wrong alleged to have been                                                                           8     done by such Commissioner, Magistrate, Police Officer or Reserve   Police Officer or other person, by any act done under colour or in   excess of any such duty or authority as aforesaid, or wherein it   shall appear to the court that the offence or wrong if committed   or done was of the character aforesaid, the prosecution or suit   shall not be entertained except with the previous sanction of the   Government.     (2) In the case of an intended suit on account of such a wrong as   aforesaid, the person intending to sue shall be bound to give to   the alleged wrongdoer one month’s notice at least of the   intended suit with sufficient description of the wrong complained   of, failing which such suit shall be dismissed.    (3) The plaint shall set forth that a notice as aforesaid has been   served on the defendant and the date of such service, and shall   state whether any, and if so, what tender of amends has been   made by the defendant. A copy of the said notice shall be   annexed to the plaint endorsed or accompanied with declaration   by the plaintiff of the time and manner of service thereof.”   20.     Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 is set out  hereinbelow for convenience:         197. Prosecution of Judges and public servants.        (1) When any person who is or was a Judge or Magistrate or a       public servant not removable from his office save by or with       the sanction of the Government is accused of any offence       alleged to have been committed by him while acting or       purporting to act in the discharge of his official duty, no Court       shall take cognizance of such offence except with the previous       sanction-        (a) in the case of a person who is employed or, as the case       may be, was at the time of commission of the alleged offence       employed, in connection with the affairs of the Union, of the       Central Government;        (b) in the case of a person who is employed or, as the case       may be, was at the time of commission of the alleged offence       employed, in connection with the affairs of a State, of the       State Government: Provided that where the alleged offence       was committed by a person referred to in clause (b) during the       period while a Proclamation issued under clause (1) of article                                                                           9         356 of the Constitution was in force in a State, clause (b) will       apply as if for the expression"" State Government"" occurring       therein, the expression"" Central Government"" were       substituted.        (2) No Court shall take cognizance of any offence alleged to       have been committed by any member of the Armed Forces of       the Union while acting or purporting to act in the discharge of       his official duty, except with the previous sanction of the       Central Government.        (3) The State Government may, by notification, direct that the       provisions of sub- section (2) shall apply to such class or       category of the members of the Forces charged with the       maintenance of public order as may be specified therein,       wherever they may be serving, and thereupon the provisions       of that sub- section will apply as if for the expression"" Central       Government"" occurring therein, the expression"" State       Government"" were substituted.    21.       Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant,  Mr. Saajan Poovayya submitted that the private complaint as also the  order dated 27-12-2016 of the Magistrate taking cognizance of the  private complaint, ought to have been quashed by the High Court, in  the absence of sanction under Section 197 of the Code of Criminal  Procedure read with Section 170 of the Karnataka Police Act, 1963.  22.       Mr. Poovayya argued that even otherwise there was no case  against the accused appellant. Even assuming that there was any ill-  treatment meted out to the appellant, while he was in police custody,  there was no specific allegation against the accused appellant, who  was not the Investigating Officer, but the Deputy Commissioner of  Police.  23.       Mr. Poovayya also emphatically argued that the respondent  was arrested on 27.02.2013, and produced before the Magistrate on                                                                       10   28.02.2013, on which date he was remanded to police custody with  the finding that there was no ill-treatment by the police. Even after  the respondent’s father filed the Habeas Corpus Petition in the High  Court, there was no finding of any ill-treatment by the High Court.  24.    Mr. Poovayya argued that the allegation of police excesses in  course of investigation, and police custody of the respondent, has a  reasonable nexus with the duty of the appellant as a police officer.  Even if the act was in dereliction of duty or in excess of duty, it was  nevertheless in exercise of authority as a police officer, in connection  with investigation of an alleged crime in which the respondent was  alleged to be involved. The police officers were duty bound to  investigate into an offence. The excesses alleged were in course of  discharge of such official duty of investigating into an offence.  25.    Mr. Poovayya emphatically argued that under Section 170 of  the karnataka Police Act, no prosecution is to be entertained against  a Police Officer, except with the previous sanction of the Government,  in case of any wrong alleged to have been done by such officer, by  any act in pursuance of any duty imposed or authority conferred on  him by any provision of the Karnataka Police Act, 1963, or any other  law for the time being in force, or even any act done under colour of  or in excess of any such duty or authority. The criminal complaint  against the accused appellant should, therefore, have been quashed  under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code for want of  sanction under Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973,  read with Section 170 of the Karnataka Police Act, 1963. In support of                                                                                 11        his argument, Mr. Poovayya cited the judgments of this Court in D.T.       Virupakshappa        v.   C.   Subash1,      Virupaxappa        Veerappa       Kadampur v. State of Mysore2, Sankaran Moitra v. Sadhna       Das and Another3 and K.K. Patel and Another v. State of       Gujarat and Another4. Mr. Poovayya also cited State of Orissa v.       Ganesh Chandra Jew5.       26.    On the other hand, Mr. Sidharth Luthra, Senior Advocate       appearing on behalf of the respondent argued that, whether sanction       was necessary or not, had to be decided, keeping in mind the nature       of the complaint, which, in this case, was of physical torture and ill-       treatment of the respondent. Ill-treatment and torture could never be       in exercise of official duty, or even under the colour of official duty.       27.    Mr. Luthra further argued that, in any case, whether sanction       was necessary or not, would have to be determined in course of the       trial, having regard to the materials brought on record by the       respective parties. A complaint should not be nipped in the bud on       the ground of want of sanction.       28.    Mr. Luthra also submitted that, an order of a Magistrate,       taking cognizance of a complaint was not amenable to challenge       under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The High Court       rightly remanded the complaint to the Trial Court.     1 (2015) 12 SCC 231 2 AIR 1963 SC 849 3 (2006) 4 SCC 584 4 (2000) 6 SCC 195 5 (2004) 8 SCC 40                                                                              12        29.      Mr. Luthra concluded with the argument that the accused       appellant can have no grievance against the judgment and order       under appeal, since the High Court has given the accused appellant       the liberty to apply for discharge under Section 245 of the Code of       Criminal Procedure and has directed the Trial Court to decide such       application, if made, before recording evidence on the merit of the       allegations made against him.       30.      In support of his arguments, Mr. Sidharth Luthra has cited       following cases:          (1)   Devinder Singh & Ors. v. State of Punjab through CBI6          (2)   State of Maharashtra v. Atma Ram        7            (3)   Bhanuprasad Hariprasad Dave v. State of Gujarat8          (4)   State of Andhra Pradesh v. N. Venugopal and Others9          (5)   Satyavir Singh Rathi, Assistant Commissioner of Police                & Ors. v. State Thr. CBI10          (6)   Bakhshish Singh Brar v. Gurmej Kaur & Anr.11          (7)   Om Prakash & Ors. v. State of Jharkhand & Anr.12        31.       To effectively adjudicate the issues raised in this appeal, it is      necessary to examine the scope and effect of Section 197 of the      Criminal Procedure Code and/or Section 170 of the Karnataka Police   6. (2016) 12 SCC 87 7. AIR 1966 SC 1786 8. AIR 1968 SC 1323 9. AIR 1964 SC 33 10. (2011) 6 SCC 1 11. (1987) 4 SCC 663 12. (2012) 12 SCC 72                                                                                   13        Act, 1963. It is necessary to examine whether want of sanction would       vitiate criminal proceedings against a police officer, in all cases? If       not, what are the circumstances in which sanction is necessary.        32.      The object of sanction for prosecution, whether under Section        197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, or under Section 170 of the        Karnataka Police Act, is to protect a public servant/police officer        discharging official duties and functions from harassment by initiation        of frivolous retaliatory criminal proceedings. As held by a Constitution        Bench of this Court in Matajog Dobey v. H.C. Bhari13 held:              “...Public servants have to be protected from harassment in             the discharge of official duties while ordinary citizens not so             engaged do not require this safeguard.………. There is no             question of any discrimination between one person and             another in the matter of taking proceedings against a public             servant for an act done or purporting to be done by the public             servant in the discharge of his official duties. No one can take             such proceedings without such sanction...”          33.      In Pukhraj v. State of Rajasthan and Another14 this        Court held:              “2. ..While the law is well settled the difficulty really arises in             applying the law to the facts of any particular case. The             intention behind the section is to prevent public servants from             being unnecessarily harassed. The section is not restricted             only to cases of anything purported to be done in good faith,             for a person who ostensibly acts in execution of his duty still             purports so to act, although he may have a dishonest             intention. Nor is it confined to cases where the act, which             constitutes the offence, is the official duty of the official             concerned. Such an interpretation would involve a             contradiction in terms, because an offence can never be an             official duty. The offence should have been committed when an             act is done in the execution of duty or when an act purports to             be done in execution of duty. The test appears to be not that  13 AIR 1956 SC 44 14 (1973) 2 SCC 701                                                                                14               the offence is capable of being committed only by a public             servant and not by anyone else, but that it is committed by a             public servant in an act done or purporting to be done in the             execution of duty. The section cannot be confined to only such             acts as are done by a public servant directly in pursuance of             his public office, though in excess of the duty or under a             mistaken belief as to the existence of such duty. Nor need the             act constituting the offence be so inseparably connected with             the official duty as to form part and parcel of the same             transaction. What is necessary is that the offence must be in             respect of an act done or purported to be done in the             discharge of an official duty. It does not apply to acts done             purely in a private capacity by a public servant. Expressions             such as the ‘capacity in which the act is performed’, ‘cloak of             office’ and ‘professed exercise of the office’ may not always be             appropriate to describe or delimit the scope of section. An act             merely because it was done negligently does not cease to be             one done or purporting to be done in execution of a duty...”         34.      In Amrik Singh v. State of Pepsu 15 this Court referred to        the judgments of the Federal Court in Dr. Hori Ram Singh v.        Emperor16; H.H.B. Gill v. Emperor17 and the judgment of the        Privy Council in H.H.B. Gill v. R18 and held:               “...The result of the authorities may thus be summed up: It is             not every offence committed by a public servant that requires             sanction for prosecution under Section 197(1) of the Code of             Criminal Procedure; nor even every act done by him while he             is actually engaged in the performance of his official duties;             but if the act complained of is directly concerned with his             official duties so that, if questioned, it could be claimed to             have been done by virtue of the office, then sanction would be             necessary; and that would be so, irrespective of whether it             was, in fact, a proper discharge of his duties, because that             would really be a matter of defence on the merits, which             would have to be investigated at the trial, and could not arise             at the stage of the grant of sanction, which must precede the             institution of the prosecution...”    15 AIR 1955 SC 309 16 AIR 1939 FC 43 17 AIR 1947 FC 9 18 AIR 1948 PC 128                                                                         15   35.    Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1898,  hereinafter referred to as the old Criminal Procedure Code, which fell  for consideration in Matajog Dobey (supra), Pukhraj (supra) and  Amrik Singh (supra) is in pari materia with Section 197 of the Code  of Criminal Procedure 1973. The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973  has repealed and replaced the old Code of Criminal Procedure.  36.    In Ganesh Chandra Jew (supra) this Court held:        “7. The protection given under Section 197 is to protect       responsible public servants against the institution of       possibly vexatious criminal proceedings for offences       alleged to have been committed by them while they are       acting or purporting to act as public servants. The policy of       the legislature is to afford adequate protection to public       servants to ensure that they are not prosecuted for       anything done by them in the discharge of their official       duties without reasonable cause, and if sanction is granted,       to confer on the Government, if they choose to exercise it,       complete control of the prosecution. This protection has       certain limits and is available only when the alleged act       done by the public servant is reasonably connected with       the discharge of his official duty and is not merely a cloak       for doing the objectionable act. If in doing his official duty,       he acted in excess of his duty, but there is a reasonable       connection between the act and the performance of the       official duty, the excess will not be a sufficient ground to       deprive the public servant of the protection. The question is       not as to the nature of the offence such as whether the       alleged offence contained an element necessarily       dependent upon the offender being a public servant, but       whether it was committed by a public servant acting or       purporting to act as such in the discharge of his official       capacity. Before Section 197 can be invoked, it must be       shown that the official concerned was accused of an       offence alleged to have been committed by him while       acting or purporting to act in the discharge of his official       duties. It is not the duty which requires examination so       much as the act, because the official act can be performed       both in the discharge of the official duty as well as in       dereliction of it. The act must fall within the scope and       range of the official duties of the public servant concerned.       It is the quality of the act which is important and the       protection of this section is available if the act falls within                                                                                16                the scope and range of his official duty.”(emphasis              supplied)         37.      In State of Orissa v. Ganesh Chandra Jew (supra) this        Court interpreted the use of the expression “ official duty” to imply        that the act or omission must have been done by the public servant        in course of his service and that it should have been in discharge of        his duty.       Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure does not        extend its protective cover to every act or omission done by a public        servant        while in service. The scope of operation of the Section is        restricted to only those acts or omissions which are done by a public        servant in discharge of official duty.        38.      In       Shreekantiah     Ramayya    Munipalli   v.   State     of        Bombay19 this Court explained the scope and object of Section 197        of the old Criminal Procedure Code, which as stated hereinabove, is in        pari materia with Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. This        Court held:                 “18. Now it is obvious that if Section 197 of the Code of                Criminal Procedure is construed too narrowly it can never                be applied, for of course it is no part of an official’s duty                to commit an offence and never can be. But it is not the                duty we have to examine so much as the act, because an                official act can be performed in the discharge of official                duty as well as in dereliction of it. The section has                content and its language must be given meaning. What it                says is—                ‘When any public servant … is accused of any offence                alleged to have been committed by him while acting or                purporting to act in the discharge of his official duty….’          We have therefore first to concentrate on the word ‘offence’.    19 AIR 1955 SC 287                                                                                  17                  19. Now an offence seldom consists of a single act. It is                usually composed of several elements and, as a rule, a                whole series of acts must be proved before it ca"

The relevant facts        leading to the filing of the aforesaid Consumer Cases are almost identical        and for the present purposes the facts leading to the filing of Consumer        Case No.3011 of 2017 are set out in detail and the appeal arising therefrom        is taken as the lead appeal. The connected appeal ? seeks to challenge the        judgment and order dated 09.08.2018 passed by the Commission in        Consumer Case No.1605 of 2017 and raises same issues of fact and law.        Delay in filing these appeals is condoned.        2.         A Housing Scheme called “The ESFERA” in Sector 13C, Gurgaon,        Haryana (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Project’) was launched by the        Appellant sometime in 2011 and all the original Complainants booked their        respective apartments by paying the booking amounts and thereafter each        of them executed Builder Buyer Agreement (hereinafter referred to as “the        Agreement”) with the Appellant.        3.         The Respondents in the leading appeal (hereinafter referred to as        “the Respondents”) booked Apartment No.1803 on the 18th Floor of Tower        No. “C” having super built up area 153.34 Sq. meters (1650 Sq. feet        approx.) @ Rs.36530.2 per Sq. meter (Rs.3395/- per Sq. foot). The basic        price was thus Rs.56,01,750/- to which additional charges such as  ?

Clauses 11.1 and 11.2 of the Agreement dated 30.11.2013 entered  into by the Respondents dealt with “delay due to reasons beyond the  control of the Developer/Company” and “failure to deliver possession due  to Government Rules, Orders, Notifications, etc.” respectively. Clause  11.4 of the Agreement was:-              “11.4 FAILURE TO DELIVER POSSESSION: REMEDY              TO THE COMPANY               The intending Allottee(s) agrees that in consequence of the              Developer/Company abandoning the Scheme or becoming              unable to give possession within three years from the date              of execution of this Agreement to such extended periods              as      permitted     under     this     Agreement,      the              Developer/Company shall be entitled to terminate this              Agreement whereupon the Developer/Company’s liability              shall be limited to the refund of the amounts paid by the              Intending Allottee(s) with simple interest @ 9% per              annum for the period such amounts we relying with the              Developer/Company and to pay no other compensation              whatsoever. However, the Developer/Company may, at its              sole option and discretion, decide not to terminate this              Agreement in which event the Developer/Company agrees              to pay only to the original Intending Allottee(s) and not to              anyone else and only in cases other than those provided in              Clauses 11.1, 11.2, 11.3 and Clause 41 and subject to the              Intending Allottee(s) not being in default under any term              of this Agreement, compensation @ Rs.5/- per sq. ft. equal              to Rs.53.8/- Per Sq.

The adjustment of such              compensation shall be done only at the time of settling the              final accounts for handing over/conveyancing the said              Apartment to the intending Allottee(s) first named in this              Agreement and not earlier.” CIVIL APPEAL NO. 3581-3590 OF 2020 @ CIVIL APPEAL DIARY NO.9796/2019 M/s Imperia Structures Ltd. vs. Anil Patni                                                                                4    Clause 41 of the Agreement was as under:-            “41.

On 01.05.2016, the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act,  2016 (hereinafter referred to as, “the RERA Act”) came into force.  6.        Over a period of time the Respondents had paid Rs.63,53,625/- out  of the agreed sum of Rs.76,43,000/-. However, even after four years there  were no signs of the Project getting completed. In the circumstances  Consumer Case No.3011 of 2017 was preferred by the Respondents on  11.10.2017 before the Commission submitting, inter alia,:-               “11. That the complainants regularly visited the site but              were surprised to see that the construction was never in              progress. No one was present on the site to address the              queries of the buyers/allotees/purchases including the              present complainant. The O.P despite taking a substantial              amount towards the consideration deliberately did not              construct the towers in which house of the complainant              was situated. The entire site seems to be an abandoned              piece of land with semi constructed structure. Despite a              delay of many months, the construction of the apartment CIVIL APPEAL NO. 3581-3590 OF 2020 @ CIVIL APPEAL DIARY NO.9796/2019 M/s Imperia Structures Ltd. vs. Anil Patni                                                                              5               has not been completed. It can hence be seen that the O.P              is deficient in renderings services and after extracting most              of the money from the buyers/allotees/purchases have              deliberately stopped the construction of the houses.               12. That it could be seen that the construction of the              residential unit ‘THE ESFERA’ in which the              buyers/allotees/purchasers flats were booked many months              back, with a promise by the O.P. to deliver the same within              42 months were never completed for the reasons best              known to the O.P., which clearly shows the ulterior motive              of the O.P. to extract money from the innocent buyers              fraudulently and also demonstrates the unfair trade              practices and restrictive trade practices under the ambit of              consumer protection act 1986.               16. That as per the clause 11.4 of the Buyer’s Agreement,              it was agreed by the O.P. that in case of any delay, the O.P.              shall pay to the buyers/allotees/purchasers, a              compensation at the rate of Rs.5/- per sq. ft. per month for              the period of the delay. It could be seen here that the O.P              has incorporated the Clause 11.4 in the one sided buyer’s              agreement and has offered to pay a meagre sum of Rs.5/-              per square feet for every month of delay if we calculate              the amount in terms of financial charges, it comes to              approximate @ 1.4% per annum rate of interest. Even              these charges are to be paid after 42 months of period that              is taken by the O.P to construct the houses as per the              buyer’s agreement. This shows that the O.P. has found a              cheap source of funding the commercial projects from the              hard earned savings and borrowed money of innocent              residential apartments/house buyers like the present              complainants. The O.P is raising funds at the interest rate              of mere 1.4% per annum and that too with initial 42              months of interest free duration.               30. That the value of goods/services along with              compensation claimed in the present complaint is above              one crore rupees hence the complainants are entitled to              invoke the pecuniary jurisdiction of this Hon’ble              Commission. The present complaint has been assessed for              a sum of Rs.1,16,94,579/- and requisite fee i.e. Rs.5000/-              by way of a demand draft payable to “THE REGISTRAR,              NCDRC New Delhi” is being paid with this complaint.                Value of goods and services         Rs.76,43,000/- CIVIL APPEAL NO. 3581-3590 OF 2020 @ CIVIL APPEAL DIARY NO.9796/2019 M/s Imperia Structures Ltd. vs. Anil Patni                                                                          6               Compensation claimed              Rs.40,51,579/-               32. In view of the above, it is, therefore, most              respectfully prayed that this Hon’ble Commission may              kindly be pleaed to:               a. Direct the O.P. to refund the entire amount collected                 form the complainants towards the consideration of the                 Flat along with interest @ 18% p.a. on the amount                 paid by them from the date of each deposit of the                 amount till it is actually returned to the complaints.               b. Direct the O.P. to pay a sum of Rs.50,000/- (rupees                 fifty thousand only) to the complainants toward the                 cost of litigation.               c. Any other order(s) as may be deemed fit and                 appropriate may also kindly be passed.”                The other nine Consumer Cases were also filed on the same day.   7.        On 17.11.2017, the Project was registered with Haryana Real  Estate Regulatory Authority, Panchkula (hereinafter referred to as,  “Haryana Authority”).

In its response dated 18.01.2018 to the aforestated Consumer Case  No.3011 of 2017, the Appellant challenged the jurisdiction of the  Commission inter alia, on the ground that the apartment having been  booked for commercial purposes, the Respondents would not come within  the definition of “the consumer” under Section 2(d) of the CP Act. No CIVIL APPEAL NO. 3581-3590 OF 2020 @ CIVIL APPEAL DIARY NO.9796/2019 M/s Imperia Structures Ltd. vs. Anil Patni                                                                               10  reference was however made to the fact that the Project had been  registered under the RERA Act. It was submitted:-              “8. That the contents and averments made in para 8 are              wrong and denied. It is denied that the date of possession              of the unit was 30th May, 2017. It is submitted that the              respondents had clearly mentioned the schedule for              possession of the said apartment/Unit was based upon its              present plans and estimates and subject to all just              exceptions, contemplates to complete the construction of              the said building/said apartment within a period of three              and half years for the date of execution of this agreement              unless there is delay or there shall be failure due to reasons              beyond the control of the company including Force-              Majeure events, delay due to compliance of new rules,              regulations, orders or notifications made/issued by              government or any other authorities with respect to              construction at the project site.               11. That the contents and averments made in Para 11 are              wrong and denied. It is pertinent to mention here that the              construction of the Tower in which the Unit of the              Complainant was allotted is in full Swing and is nearing              possession. The allegations levelled by the Complainant              are concocted & baseless.   9.        In their replication, the Respondents submitted, inter alia,:-              “….. the buyer’s agreement was a fixed set of papers,              which was asked to be signed by the complainant and no              modification was entertained by the O.P. On request to              change the one sided clauses, it was told that the buyer’s              agreement has to be signed as it is and in case it is not              acceptable than the allotment will stand cancelled and              earnest money will be forfeited.”   10.       Consumer Case No.3011 of 2017 was allowed by the Commission  by its judgement and order dated 12.09.2018. It was observed:-              “10. It is pertinent to note that the Developer has not filed              any evidence to support his contention that the delay              occurred due to force majeure events.               In fact              demonetization, non-availability of contractual labour, CIVIL APPEAL NO. 3581-3590 OF 2020 @ CIVIL APPEAL DIARY NO.9796/2019 M/s Imperia Structures Ltd. vs. Anil Patni                                                                             11               delay in notifying approvals cannot be construed to be              force majeure events from any angle.               11. Learned Counsel for the Developer vehemently              argued that the Complainants were offered alternative              accommodation vide letter dated 03.04.2017 which was              not accepted by them. The said letter is reproduced as              hereunder:-                    “Be that as it may, in view of your allegations                   of delay which we deny, we hereby offer that                   till we complete construction of your subject                   matter flat we shall arrange alternative                   accommodation/flat for you in Group Housing                   Colony named “Takshila Heights” situated at                   Sector-37C, Gurgaon on lease/rent with                   immediate effect. We will bear the rent of                   alternative accommodation/flat at “Takshila                   Heights”. However, you shall have to pay the                   common area maintenance charges and other                   user based charges like electricity, etc., which                   you would have done for your flat in “Esfera”                   as well.” (Emphasis supplied).               12. It is significant to mention that in the afore-noted              letter there is an admission by the Developer that the              construction is still not completed. Additionally, even the              specific date of delivery of possession has not been              mentioned anywhere either in the Written Version or in the              Affidavit or even in the letter dated 03.04.2017 which the              Counsel is relying upon.”            Concluding that the Appellant was deficient in rendering service,  the Commission granted relief to the Respondents in following terms:-               “14. Keeping in view the admitted incomplete              construction, the fact that some of the Complainants have              also taken bank loans and are paying EMIs and              considering the stipulation provided in Clause 11.4, this              Complaint is partly allowed directing the Developer to              refund the amounts deposited with simple interest @ 9%              p.a. from the respective dates of deposits till the date of              realization together with costs of Rs.50,000/- to be paid to              each of the Complainants. The directions are to be              complied withing fours weeks from the date of receipt of a CIVIL APPEAL NO. 3581-3590 OF 2020 @ CIVIL APPEAL DIARY NO.9796/2019 M/s Imperia Structures Ltd. vs. Anil Patni                                                                            12               copy of the order, failing which, the amount shall attract              interest @ 12% p.a. for the said period.”   11.       Similarly, all other complaints were allowed by the Commission  granting relief of refund of the amounts deposited by each of the  Complainants with simple interest @ 9% per annum from the respective  dates of deposits alongwith Rs.50,000/- towards costs. It was also directed  that the amounts be deposited within four weeks, failing which the  amounts would carry interest @ 12% per annum.  12.       The Appellant being aggrieved preferred the instant appeals on  14.03.2019. By way of Additional Documents, a copy of the letter dated  17.11.2017 was placed on record. An order passed by Haryana Authority,  Gurugram on 17.01.2019 in a complaint preferred by one Himanshu Giri  was also placed on record. The directions issued in said order were to the  following effect:-              “27. After taking into consideration all the material facts              as adduced and produced by both the parties, the authority              exercising powers vested in it under section 37 of the Real              Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 hereby              issues the following directions to the respondent in the              interest of justice and fair play:               i.   The respondent is directed to provide delay                   possession charges at the prescribed rate of 10.75%                   per annum for every month of delay w.e.f. 15.9.2016                   as per the provisions of Section 18(1) of the Real                   Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016.              ii.

The appeal memo also did not make any reference to the fact that  the Project had been registered under the RERA Act. In the leading appeal,  following assertions were made in the list of dates and events:-               “2011-2017         The Appellant was unable to hand                                 over    the    possession     to    the                                 Respondents within the stipulate time                                 as stipulated in Clause 10.1 due to                                 reasons beyond control of the                                 Appellant viz., due to severe shortage                                 of contractual labourers and delay                                 caused in obtaining statutory requisite                                 permissions for carrying on the                                 construction of said flats, failed to                                 deliver possession of the subject flats                                 to the Respondents within the                                 prescribed time limit.             One of the grounds raised in the appeal memo was as under:-               “C. Because the Hon’ble Commission failed to appreciate              that the Policy of Demonetization introduced by the              Government of India constituted as an event of Force              Majeure since as a consequence of the said event,              numerous persons including the Appellant suffered              shortage of cash which resulted in delay in delivering              possession to the Respondent. It is humbly submitted that              the shortage of cash ensuing as a result of the              Demonitization policy resulted in the stopping of work              since the process of construction requires many payments              to be made in cash on a day to day basis, for example,              wages paid to daily wage workers, payments made against              delivery of construction materials, etc.” CIVIL APPEAL NO. 3581-3590 OF 2020 @ CIVIL APPEAL DIARY NO.9796/2019 M/s Imperia Structures Ltd. vs. Anil Patni                                                                           14  14.

Introductory  1.      These appeals are essentially directed against the common order dated  01.08.2019 as passed by the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal, New  Delhi1 in a batch of appeals preferred by various banks and financial  institutions whereby, the Appellate Tribunal set aside the order dated  16.05.2018, passed by the Adjudicating Authority, the National Company Law  1 Hereinafter also referred to as ‘the Appellate Tribunal’ or ‘NCLAT’                                                       2   Tribunal, Allahabad Bench2 on the application moved by the Interim Resolution  Professional3 in the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process4 concerning the  Corporate Debtor Company viz., Jaypee Infratech Limited5 seeking avoidance  of certain transactions, whereby the corporate debtor had mortgaged its  properties as collateral securities for the loans and advances made by the  lender banks and financial institutions to Jaiprakash Associates Limited 6, the  holding company of JIL, as being preferential, undervalued and fraudulent, in  terms of Sections 43, 45 and 66 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code,  20167.  1.1.    It may be noticed at the outset that the batch of appeals decided by the  impugned common order dated 01.08.2019 also comprised of two appeals  filed by the lenders of JAL, being Comp. App (AT) (Ins) No. 353 of 2018 and  Comp. App (AT) (Ins) No. 301 of 2018 that were preferred against the orders  passed by NCLT on 09.05.2018 and 15.05.2018 respectively, whereby NCLT  approved the decision of IRP rejecting the claims of such lenders of JAL to be  recognized as financial creditors of the corporate debtor JIL on the strength of  the mortgage created by the corporate debtor, as collateral security of the debt  of its holding company JAL. These two appeals also came to be allowed as  per the result recorded in the impugned order dated 01.08.2019, though the   2 Hereinafter also referred to as ‘the Tribunal’ or ‘NCLT’ or ‘the Adjudicating Authority’. 3 ‘IRP’ for short. 4 ‘CIRP’ for short. 5 ‘JIL’ for short; also referred to as ‘the corporate debtor’. 6 ‘JAL’ for short. 7 Hereinafter also referred to as ‘the Code’ or ‘IBC’.                                               3   entire discussion and the final conclusion therein had only been in relation to  the order dated 16.05.2018 that was passed by NCLT on the application for  avoidance filed by IRP. The appellant of Civil Appeal D. No. 32881 of 2019 8,  IIFCL, apart from raising other contentions, has also questioned this aspect of  the order impugned that the aforesaid two appeals, involving the question as  to whether the lenders of JAL could be categorised as financial creditors of JIL  for the purpose of IBC, have been allowed by NCLAT without recording any  findings and without any discussion in that regard.  Brief Outline and the Issues Involved  2.     Before proceeding further, we may draw up a brief outline of the subject-  matter and the issues involved in these appeals.  2.1.   As shall be noticed hereafter later, the CIRP concerning the corporate  debtor JIL has already undergone several rounds and circles of proceedings in  NCLT, NCLAT and at least twice over in this Court.  2.2.   For what has been indicated in the introduction, it is evident that two  major issues would arise in these appeals. One, as to whether the transactions  in question deserve to be avoided as being preferential, undervalued and  fraudulent, in terms of Sections 43, 45 and 66 of the Code; and second, as to  whether the respondents (lender of JAL) could be recognized as financial  creditors of the corporate debtor JIL on the strength of the mortgage created   8 Now numbered as Civil Appeal Nos. 009357-77 of 2019                                         4   by the corporate debtor, as collateral security of the debt of its holding  company JAL.  2.3.   For a preliminary insight into the first issue, suffice would be to notice  that during CIRP, the Interim Resolution Professional preferred an application  before the Adjudicating Authority seeking orders for avoidance of the  impugned transactions, whereby several parcels of land were put under  mortgage with the lenders of JAL, the holding company of JIL. The contention  of IRP, that the transactions in question were preferential, undervalued and  fraudulent within the meaning of Sections 43, 45 and 66 of the Code, were  accepted in part by the Adjudicating Authority, the NCLT, in its order dated  16.05.2018 and necessary directions were issued for avoidance of at least six  of such transactions. In other words, in relation to such six transactions, the  security interest was ordered to be discharged and the properties involved  therein were vested in the corporate debtor, with release of encumbrances.  The NCLAT, however, took an entirely opposite view of the matter and  upturned the order so passed by NCLT, while holding that the transactions in  question do not fall within the mischief of being preferential or undervalued or  fraudulent; and that the lenders in question (the lenders of JAL) were entitled  to exercise their rights under the Code. Aggrieved, the IRP, one of the creditors  of the corporate debtor JIL and the associations of home buyers, who have  invested in the proposed projects of JIL and JAL, have preferred these                                         5   appeals.  2.4.   As regards the second issue, noticeable it is that during CIRP, two of the  respondent banks namely, ICICI Bank Limited and Axis Bank Limited, sought  inclusion in the category of financial creditors of JIL but IRP did not agree and  declined to recognize them as such. Being aggrieved by the decisions so  taken by IRP, the said banks preferred separate applications under Section  60(5) of the Code before NCLT while asserting their claim to be recognized as  financial creditors of the corporate debtor JIL, on account of the securities  provided by JIL for the facilities granted to JAL. The NCLT rejected the  applications so filed by the said banks, by way of its orders dated 09.05.2018  and 15.05.2018 respectively, while concluding that on the strength of the  mortgage created by the corporate debtor JIL, as collateral security of the debt  of its holding company JAL, the lenders of JAL could not be categorised as  financial creditors of JIL for the purpose of the Code. As already noticed, the  appeals against the said orders dated 09.05.2018 and 15.05.2018 are  purportedly allowed as per the result recorded in the impugned order dated  01.08.2019, but without any discussion in that regard. Aggrieved, one of the  lenders of the corporate debtor JIL, IIFCL (appellant of Civil Appeal D. No.  32881 of 2019) has also questioned this aspect of the order impugned while  asserting that such mortgagees cannot be taken as financial creditors of the  corporate debtor JIL.                                          6   Parties and their respective roles and interest in the matter  3.     In view of the issues arising for determination in these appeals, with  several parties carrying different roles, status and interests, worthwhile it would  be to narrate at the outset, in brief, the relevant particulars of the key parties  involved as follows:  3.1. Jaypee Infratech Limited (JIL):        It is the corporate debtor company in whose relation CIRP is pending;  and the mortgage transactions concerning its properties were questioned in  the application filed by the Interim Resolution Professional. Such transactions  form the subject-matter of these appeals.  3.2.   Jaiprakash Associates Limited (JAL):         It is the holding company of JIL; it had approximately 71.64% equity  shareholding in JIL as on 31.03.2017. The impugned mortgage transactions  were entered into in favour of its lenders.  3.3.   Shri Anuj Jain:         He is the Interim Resolution Professional in CIRP concerning JIL who  moved the application for avoidance of the transactions in question. He is the  appellant in Civil Appeal Nos. 8512-27 of 2019.  3.4.   Jaypee Greens Krescent Home Buyers Welfare Association; Jaypee Kasa Isles Welfare Association; Jaypee Kensington Boulevard Apartments Welfare Association; Garden Isle Welfare Association; Jaypee Klassic Apartment Welfare Association; Jaypee Kube Buyers Welfare Association; Wish Town Property Owners Welfare Society; KRH Buyers Association ABL Workplace:                                         7         They are the associations of home buyers who have invested in the  projects of JIL and JAL. They are the appellants in Civil Appeal Nos. 6777-97  of 2019; and they also support the assertion of IRP that the transactions in  question cannot be countenanced.  3.5   India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited:        It is the financial creditor of the corporate debtor JIL and has filed Civil  Appeal in Diary No. 32881 of 2019 while asserting that the transactions in  question need to be avoided; and that the lenders of JAL related with such  transactions cannot be the financial creditors of JIL for the purpose of CIRP in  question.  3.6   Axis Bank Limited; Standard Chartered Bank Limited; ICICI Bank Limited; State Bank of India; United Bank of India; UCO Bank; The Karur Vyasa Bank (P) Limited; L&T Infrastructure Finance Company Limited; Central Bank of India; Canara Bank; Karnataka Bank Limited; IFCI Limited; Allahabad Bank; Jammu & Kashmir Bank; South Indian Bank Limited; Bank of Maharashtra and other banks and financial institutions:        They are the lenders of JAL in whose favour the properties of JIL were  put under mortgage by way of the impugned transactions. They oppose the  assertions of appellants while maintaining that the transactions in question are  not avoidable and are valid, investing them with the capacity of financial  creditors of JIL. They are the principal contesting respondents in these  appeals.                                                      8   The transactions in question  4.      Having taken note of the principal contesting parties and their respective  interests, it would also be worthwhile to take note of the relevant particulars of  the properties and the transactions involved in this dispute. It may be usefully  noticed that out of seven transactions that were questioned by IRP, the  Adjudicating Authority held that six of them were preferential, undervalued and  fraudulent and passed the orders for their avoidance while accepting the  contentions of IRP. It may also be observed that five out of these six  transactions were preceded by previous mortgage transactions for securing  the loans/facilities to JAL. The transactions in question, with previous  transactions and flow thereof, as given out during the course of submissions,  could be comprehensively viewed as under: -  4.1.

The sixth transaction in question had been the exclusive mortgage  transaction in favour of State Bank of India that was not preceded by any  earlier transaction; the same had been as under:-                  Mortgage deed dated 04.03.2016 for 90 acres of land situated at                 Village Chaugan Tehsil Elmadpur, District Agra, Uttar Pradesh,                 executed by JIL in favour of State Bank of India against the facility                 agreement dated 26.03.2015 granting Short Term Loan Facility to                 JAL of Rs.1000 crores.14  4.5.    Yet another transaction was questioned by IRP as being avoidable but  the Adjudicating Authority held the same to be not falling within the relevant  time as provided under Section 43 of the Code. The particulars of this  transaction are as follows:                   Mortgage deed dated 12.05.2014 for 100 acres of land situated at                 Village Tappal, Tehsil Khair, District Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh                 executed by JIL in favour of ICICI Bank Limited against the facility                 agreement dated 12.12.2013 granting Term Loan of Rs. 1500                 crores and overdraft amount of Rs. 175 crores to JAL.15  The relevant factual and background aspects  5.      Having taken note of the principal parties to the dispute and the  transactions/properties involved, but before dilating on the issues, we may  briefly narrate the background in which the present CIRP is underway as also  the orders passed by this Court, for ensuring its completion in accordance with  law and towards the larger benefit of stakeholders.  14 Hereinafter also referred to as ‘Property No. 6’ 15 Hereinafter also referred to as ‘Property No. 7’ (As regards this description, it is pointed out on behalf of the respondent ICICI Bank that it had been of ‘Term Loan of Rs. 1500 crores under the Corporate Rupee Loan Facility agreement and General Conditions dated 12.12.2013 and mortgage deed was dated 10.03.2014’)                                        12   6.     JAL is stated to be a public listed company with more than 5 lakh  individual shareholders. In the year 2003, JAL was awarded the rights for  construction of an expressway from Noida to Agra. A concession agreement  was entered into with the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development  Authority. Coming on the heels of this project, JIL was set up as a special  purpose vehicle. Finance was obtained from a consortium of banks against  the partial mortgage of land acquired and a pledge of 51% of the shareholding  held by JAL. Housing plans were envisaged for the construction of real estate  projects in two locations of the land acquired, one in Wish Town, Noida and  another in Mirzapur. Several other aspects of the dealings by these  companies, their creditors and other stakeholders need not be dilated for the  present purpose.  6.1.   The crucial and relevant part of the matter is that IDBI Bank Limited  instituted a petition under Section 7 of the Code before the NCLT, seeking  initiation of Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process against JIL, while  alleging that JIL had committed a default in repayment of its dues to the tune  of Rs. 526.11 crores. JIL filed its objections to the petition but later on,  withdrew the objections and furnished consent for resolution plan under the  provisions of the Code. On 09.08.2017, NCLT initiated the CIRP in respect of  JIL. An order of moratorium was issued under Section 14 by which, the  institution of suits and continuation of pending proceedings, including  execution proceedings were prohibited and an Interim Resolution Professional                                          13   was appointed. On 14.08.2017, IRP, in pursuance of the order of NCLT, called  for submissions of claims by financial creditors in Form-C, by operational  creditors in Form-B, by the workmen and employees in Form-E and by other  creditors in Form-F. On 16.08.2017, the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of  India made an amendment to its regulations and Regulation 9(a) was inserted  to include the claims by other creditors. On 18.08.2017, the Board released a  press note that the home buyers could fill in Form-F as they could not be  treated at par with financial and operational creditors.  6.2.   The aforesaid position led to the proceedings in this Court that were  dealt with in a batch of petitions led by Writ Petition (Civil) No. 744 of 2017:  Chitra Sharma and Ors. v. Union of India and Ors. Several orders were  passed by this Court in the said batch of petitions from time to time, inter alia,  to the effect that IRP was permitted to take over management of JIL and was  directed to ensure that necessary provisions were made to protect the  interests of home buyers. Various orders were also made with directions to  JAL, as holding company of JIL, for making deposits in the Court, particularly  looking to the claim of refund being made by some of the home buyers. This  Court also took note of the facts that CIRP commenced on 09.08.2017; the  statutory period of 180 days for concluding the CIRP had come to an end; and  even the extended statutory period of 90 days also ended on 12.05.2018 but  then, by way of the Amendment Ordinance, 2018, the home buyers were  accorded the statutory recognition as financial creditors w.e.f. 06.06.2018.                                          14   While finally disposing of the matters on 09.08.2018, this Court took note of  the interest of home buyers as also the creditors of JIL and JAL, the status of  proceedings and the statutory provisions as then obtaining and ultimately  issued the following directions: -          “(i) In exercise of the power vested in this Court under Article         142 of the Constitution, we direct that the initial period of 180 days         for the conclusion of the CIRP in respect of JIL shall commence         from the date of this order. If it becomes necessary to apply for a         further extension of 90 days, we permit the NCLT to pass         appropriate orders in accordance with the provisions of the IBC;         (ii) We direct that a CoC shall be constituted afresh in         accordance with the provisions of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy         (Amendment) Ordinance, 2018, more particularly the amended         definition of the expression “financial creditors”;         (iii) We permit the IRP to invite fresh expressions of interest for         the submission of resolution plans by applicants, in addition to the         three short-listed bidders whose bids or, as the case may be,         revised bids may also be considered;         (iv) JIL/JAL and their promoters shall be ineligible to participate         in the CIRP by virtue of the provisions of Section 29A;         (v) RBI is allowed, in terms of its application to this Court to         direct the banks to initiate corporate insolvency resolution         proceedings against JAL under the IBC;         (vi) The amount of Rs 750 crores which has been deposited in         this Court by JAL/JIL shall together with the interest accrued         thereon be transferred to the NCLT and continue to remain         invested and shall abide by such directions as may be issued by         the NCLT.”  6.3.   It had been during pendency of the aforesaid proceedings that the  application leading to present appeals came to be filed by IRP on 06.02.2018,  complaining against the transactions in question. However, before taking note  of the matters involved in such application filed by IRP and, for completion of                                                   15   the narration about the orders passed by this Court, we may also point out that  during the CIRP of JIL, an application came to be made by IDBI bank, for  excluding the period of pendency of the application for clarification regarding  the manner of counting of the votes of the concerned financial creditors, for the  purpose of the period of 270 days for completion of corporate insolvency  resolution process but, during the pendency of such application, NCLT, by its  order dated 06.05.2019, called upon the authorities and the representatives of  allottees and others to file reply on the necessity to proceed further with CIRP  for considering the resolution plan received from the concerned bidder. The  IDBI Bank assailed this order of NCLT by way of an appeal before the NCLAT  that came to be decided on 30.07.2019 whereby, NCLAT granted relief to  exclude the period from 17.09.2018 to 04.06.2019 for the purpose of counting  270 days of CIRP period and issued consequential directions. This led to  further appeals in this Court16, which were considered and decided on  06.11.2019.  6.3.1. In the order dated 06.11.2019, we took note of the fact that CIRP in  relation to JIL stood revived in view of the directions in Chitra Sharma (supra)  as also the amendments brought about in IBC. In the peculiar, rather  extraordinary, situation obtaining in the matter, we passed the orders under the  plenary powers so as to ensure that an attempt was made for revival of the  corporate debtor JIL, lest it was exposed to liquidation process while taking  16 Being Civil Appeal No. 8437 of 2019 [@ D No. 27229 of 2019]: Jaiprakash Associates Ltd. & Anr. v.

R. Shah, J.             1.             Leave granted.                           Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned order            dated 14.07.2017 passed by the High Court of Madhya Pradesh at            Gwalior in Review Petition No.465 of 2015 in First Appeal No.241 of            2005, by which the High Court has allowed the said review petition Signature Not Verified  Digitally signed by ARJUN BISHT Date: 2020.11.03            filed by the respondent nos. 1 and 2 herein­ original defendants 16:47:00 IST Reason:                                   2   nos. 1 and 2, and has reviewed the judgment and order dated  10.12.2013 passed in First Appeal No.241 of 2005 and has deleted  the observations made in para 20 of the said judgment and order  more particularly with respect to the observations made in para 20  as regards the possession of the disputed house, which were in  favour of the appellants ­ the original plaintiffs, the appellants have  preferred the present appeal.   2.   The relevant facts leading to the present appeal in nutshell are  as under:       That one Shri Ram Sahu, the predecessor of the appellants  herein instituted Civil Suit No.04A of 2005 before the Learned Trial  Court against the respondents herein ­ original defendants for  declaration of registered Sale Deed dated 25.03.1995 executed by  original defendant no.3 in favour of original defendant nos. 1 & 2  regarding House No.28/955 (previous House No.3/1582), situated  in Sube Ki Payga, Jiwajiganj, Lashkar, as null and void and for  permanent injunction against defendant nos. 1 & 2 restraining  defendant nos. 1 & 2 from transferring the disputed property to any  other person.                                    3   2.1. That the original plaintiff Shri Ram Sahu claimed the  ownership of the disputed property on the basis of the will executed  by one Chhimmabai executed in his favour on 19.10.1993.            The  original plaintiff also claimed that he became the sole owner on the  death of the Chhimmabai and possession holder of the entire house  and in the same capacity; he is in continuous possession over the  same.   It was the case on behalf of the defendants that the said  Chhimmabai adopted defendant No.3 and later on, she got  registered the Adoption Deed on 13.05.1992 and that the original  defendant no.3 sold the disputed property in favour of the  respondent nos. 1 & 2. The original plaintiff denied the adoption of  defendant no.3 by the said Chhimmabai.       The written statement  was filed on behalf of the respondents.       They denied that the  disputed property was the Joint Hindu Family property. Defendant  nos. 1 and 2 also claimed to be the bona fide purchasers and in  possession of the suit property.   2.2. The Learned Trial Court framed the following issues:       “1. Whether, the Disputed House No.28/95 situated in Sube      Ki Payga, Jiwajiganj, Lashkar, Gwalior was purchased from      the income of Joint Hindu Family of Ghasilal and Mangaliya?                                     4         2. Whether, the wife of Ghasilal namely Chhimmabai had      executed Will of aforesaid House in favour of the Plaintiff on      19.10.1993?       3. Whether, Defendant No.3 was adopted by Ghasilal on      28.01.1985, which was got registered by Chhimmabai on      13.05.1992.       4. Whether, Sale Deed dated 25.03.1995 regarding the      disputed house was executed by Defendant No.3 in favour of      Defendant Nos. 1 & 2 without having any right?       5. Whether, the Plaintiff is entitled to get the Registered Sale      Deed Dated 25.03.1995 as null and void?       6.   Whether, Plaintiff is entitled to receive Permanent      Injunction against the Defendant Nos. 1 & 2 for not to sell the      disputed house?       7. Whether, the Defendant Nos. 1 & 2 are entitled to receive      special compensation from the Plaintiff? If Yes, then how      much?       8. Relief & Costs.”   2.3. Both the parties led the evidence, oral as well as documentary,  in support of their respective claims.   2.4. Original Plaintiff Shri Ram Sahu – appellant herein was  examined as PW1.       He was also cross­examined (his deposition  shall be discussed herein below).        He also led the evidence in  support of his claim that he is in possession of the said property.                                   5   On behalf of the defendants, defendant no.1 stepped into the  witness box and through him; the defendants also produced on  record the documentary evidences.  2.5.      On appreciation of the evidence, the Learned Trial Court  dismissed the suit. The Learned Trial Court disbelieved the case on  behalf of plaintiff – appellant herein that Chhimmabai executed the  will in favour of the plaintiff ­ appellant. The Learned Trial Court  held that the defence had proved that defendant No.3 was adopted  by Ghasilal on 26.01.1985 which was got registered later on by  Chhimmabai vide Adoption Deed dated 13.05.1992.   2.6. Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the Judgment and  decree passed by the Learned Trial Court dismissing the suit, the  original plaintiff – appellant herein preferred First Appeal No.241 of  2005 before the High Court. That during the pendency of the said  appeal, respondent no.1 herein filed an application under section  151 C.P.C. on 19.03.2012 for dismissing the appeal and for  directing the appellant herein to vacate the suit property.      That  during the pendency of the appeal the original plaintiff – appellant  herein filed an application under Order 6 Rule 17 of the CPC by                                   6   which the plaintiff sought amendment in the relief clause as regards  the issuance of permanent injunction and restraining defendant  nos.1 and 2 from dispossessing the plaintiffs forcibly from the  disputed house.      However, the said application came to be  dismissed by the High Court on the ground of delay and latches  (I.A. No.2244 of 2012).      However, while dismissing the said  application the High Court granted permission to the appellants to  file a separate suit for the said relief against the defendants.  Thereafter on appreciation of the evidence on record, the High Court  dismissed the said appeal preferred by the original plaintiff.  However, while dismissing the appeal the High Court also made  observations as regards the possession of the disputed house and  on analysis of the deposition of PW1 and PW2 and considering the  material on record and considering the fact that during the  pendency of the appeal the original defendant no.1 himself filed an  application under Section 151 CPC on 02.12.2013 for getting the  possession from the plaintiff of the disputed house, which was  withdrawn, the High Court made observations in regards the  possession of the plaintiffs of the disputed house.                                  7   2.7   Thereafter almost 2 years after the judgment of the High Court  in the First Appeal, the Respondent Nos.1 & 2 herein ­ Original  Defendant Nos. 1 & 2 filed an application before the High Court  seeking review of observations in para 20 of the judgment as  regards the possession of the disputed house. The said application  was opposed by the appellants herein. However, by the impugned  order, the High Court has allowed the review application and has  ordered to delete para 20 of the Judgment and order dated  10.12.2013 passed in First Appeal No.241 of 2005, by observing  that as regards the possession of the disputed property the issue of  possession was neither raised before the Learned Trial Court nor  before the First Appellate Court and even no issue with respect to  possession was framed by the Learned Trial Court.   2.8. Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned order  passed by the High Court in allowing the review application and  deleting para 20 of the judgment and order dated 10.12.2013  passed in First Appeal No.241 of 2005, the original plaintiffs have  preferred the present appeal.                                   8   3.   Shri A.K. Srivastava, learned Senior Advocate appearing on  behalf of the appellants has made the following submissions, while  assailing the impugned order passed by the High Court passed in  the review application.  (i) while passing the impugned order, the High Court has exceeded  in its jurisdiction, while exercising the review jurisdiction and has  acted beyond the scope and ambit of the review jurisdiction under  Order 47 Rule 1 CPC;  (ii) while exercising the review jurisdiction, the High Court ought  not to have set aside the specific finding given with respect to  possession, which finding was based on appreciation of evidence  before the learned trial Court;  (iii) the High Court has committed a grave error in deleting para 20  of the final judgment and order dated 10.12.2013 passed in First  Appeal No. 241/2005, in exercise of its review jurisdiction  inasmuch as, as such, there was no error apparent on the face of  the record, which was required to be corrected;  (iv) merely because the specific issue with respect to possession was  not framed by the learned trial Court, cannot be a ground to set                                    9   aside the finding by the High Court, when such finding with respect  to possession was on merits and on appreciation of the evidence  before the learned trial Court;  (v) as such, the High Court has committed a grave error in  considering the issues framed in another case being Civil Suit No.  3­A/2005, which was related to House No. 28/956 and in which the  parties were also different. It is submitted that the High Court has  mis­directed itself, while considering the issues framed in Civil Suit  No. 3­A/2005, related to House No. 28/956 and not considering the  issues framed in Civil Suit No. 4­A/2005;  (vi) the High Court ought to have appreciated that the issue of  possession was at large before the learned trial Court and, in fact,  the parties also led evidence with respect to possession.          It is  submitted that the High Court ought to have appreciated that there  was a specific averment in the plaint as well as in the testimony of  the plaintiff that he is in possession of the suit property, i.e., House  No. 28/955;  (vii) the defendants did not led any evidence with respect to  possession. It is submitted therefore that when there were specific                                  10   averments and pleadings in the plaint in regard to possession, and  even the plaintiff led the evidence specifically on the possession,  non­framing of the specific issue with respect to possession would  not vitiate the finding recorded by the High Court, which was on  appreciation of the material on record.         In support of his  submission, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the  appellants has relied upon the following decisions of this Court, Sri  Gangai Vinayagar Temple v. Meenakshi Ammal (2015) 3 SCC 624;  Bhuwan Singh v. Oriental Insurance Company Ltd. (2009) 5 SCC  136; and Sayeda Akhtar v. Abdul Ahad (2003) 7 SCC 52.           It is  submitted that all the parties were aware of the rival cases and the  issue with respect to possession was present and even the plaintiffs  also led evidence on possession, non­framing of the specific issue  with respect to possession would be non­significant. It is submitted  that therefore the High Court has committed a grave error in  deleting para 20 of the final judgment and order dated 10.12.2013  passed in First Appeal No. 241/2005 with respect to possession  mainly on the ground that no issue was framed by the learned trial  Court with respect to possession;                                  11   3.1   Learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellants  has also taken us to the relevant averments in the plaint as well as  the written statement in regard to possession.       Learned Counsel  appearing on behalf of the appellants has also taken us to the  testimony of the plaintiff – Shri Ram Sahu, as well as, the  deposition of one J.K. Sharma examined on behalf of the plaintiff.  Learned Senior Advocate has further submitted that there was no  cross­examination by the defendants on the point of the plaintiff’s  possession. Learned Senior Advocate has also heavily relied upon  the application and affidavit dated 19.03.2012 in which the  respondents in an application filed under Section 151 of the CPC  specifically prayed to direct the appellants to vacate the suit  property.   It is submitted that therefore, in fact, the respondents  admitted the possession of the appellants. It is submitted that not  only that, but subsequently in the month of September, 2017, the  respondents filed a suit against the appellants for decree of  possession, compensation and mesne profits. It is submitted that  therefore, as such, the respondents herein specifically admitted the  possession of the appellants in the suit property;                                    12   3.2   It is further submitted that the High Court ought to have  appreciated that the review application was filed with a malafide  intention faced with the proceedings under Section 340 read with  Section 195 Cr.P.C and faced with the order passed by the learned  Magistrate directing to register the case against respondent nos. 1  and 2 herein and others under Sections 193, 465, 471 and 120­B of  the IPC, dated 06.02.2016;  3.3   It is further submitted that, in fact, the appellants filed an  application before the High Court under Order 6 Rule 17 CPC (IA  No. 2244/2012) to amend the plaint by adding relief for the grant of  decree of permanent injunction restraining the respondents­  defendants not to dispossess them forcibly. It is submitted that the  said application was opposed by the respondents herein by  submitting that they are not threatening to dispossess the  appellants during the pendency of the suit.        Therefore, the High  Court dismissed the said application under Order 6 Rule 17 CPC  reserving liberty in favour of the appellants to file a separate suit for  the aforesaid relief.   It is submitted that therefore, as such, the                                     13   issue with respect to possession was at large even before the High  Court;  3.4   Learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellants  has also heavily relied upon the order passed by the learned  Magistrate on an application filed under Section 340 read with  Section 195 Cr.P.C., in which the learned Magistrate took note of  the affidavit dated 19.03.2012 filed by the respondents and also  took note of the specific observation and finding with respect to  possession made in para 20 of the judgment and order dated  10.12.2013. It is submitted that there is a specific finding given by  the      learned      Magistrate          on    the        respondents’  forging/creating/concocting    the       documents    to   show   their  possession.    It is submitted that only thereafter the learned  Magistrate directed to register the case against the respondents  under Sections 193, 465, 471 and 120­B of the IPC, under the  provisions of Section 340 Cr.P.C;  3.5   It is submitted that even subsequently the suit filed by the  defendants­respondents herein, filed in the year 2017, has been  dismissed by the High Court on the ground of limitation and the                                    14   plaint has been rejected in exercise of powers under Order 7 Rule  11 CPC;  3.6   Making the above submissions and relying upon the aforesaid  decisions, it is prayed to allow the present appeal.   4.    Shri Punit Jain, Learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the  respondents while opposing the present appeal and supporting the  impugned order passed by the High Court has vehemently  submitted that in the facts and circumstances of the case the High  Court has not committed an error in deleting para 20 of the  judgment and order dated 10.12.2013 passed in First Appeal  No.241 of 2005 in exercise of the review jurisdiction.   4.1   It is submitted that as such the original plaintiff filed the suit  seeking cancellation of the sale deed dated 25.03.1995 and  permanent injunction to the effect that the defendant nos. 1 & 2  (respondents herein) shall not transfer the property to any other  person. It is submitted that since no injunction from dispossession  was sought and only injunction against further transfer was sought  no issue was framed in respect of possession. It is submitted that                                  15   therefore in absence of any specific issue framed by the Learned  Trial Court in respect of possession of the property and when the  suit was dismissed and even thereafter the appeal also came to be  dismissed, there was no reason and/or occasion for the High Court  to make any observation in respect of possession and therefore the  High Court has rightly deleted the observations made in para 20 in  respect of possession.   It is submitted that during the lifetime of  Shri Ghisa Lal Sahu, he was in possession of the property. After  his death, his wife Smt. Chhimmabai came into possession of the  property.   She continued to be in possession and after her, the  adopted son – Dilip Kumar Sahu came into possession. The issue  of adoption of Shri Dilip Kumar Sahu was a subject matter of  litigation in Suit No.4A of 2001, where the said adoption and the  adoption deed dated 13.05.1992 was challenged. The said suit was  finally dismissed by the High Court by an order dated 07.09.2009  in SA No.315 of 2005.      The will setup by the petitioner dated  19.10.1993 was also a subject matter of suit No.45A of 2003 filed  by Dilip Kumar Sahu. The said suit was decreed by a judgment  dated 07.09.2009 in SA No.946 of 2005. Some parts of the property                                     16   was in possession of Tenants – (i) Om Babu Saxena and (ii) Kashmir  Singh Yadav. Shri Dilip Kumar Sahu got possession from the said  tenants on 30.01.1995 by entering into compromises with them.  Shri Dilip Kumar Sahu executed sale deed dated 25.03.1995 in  favour of the Respondents. Under the said sale, possession of the  property   was   given   to   the   respondents.   The   petitioner   got  possession of another portion of the property from another tenant –  Parvesh Singh Jadon pursuant to a judgment and decree dated  18.10.2014. The petitioner has not shown as to how, under what  capacity and when the petitioner came into possession of the  property, constructive or otherwise.  4.2   So far as the withdrawal of the application dated 02.12.2013  in I.A. No.1267 of 2012 which was filed by the respondents is  concerned, it is submitted that the said application was withdrawn  since (i) no relief could have been claimed arising out of a suit  initiated by the plaintiffs and (ii) further the portion of the property  in possession of the estranged wife of the petitioner ­ Smt. Sheela  Sahu who was not a party to the said proceedings.                                   17   4.3   It is submitted even the application submitted by the  petitioner under Order 6 Rule 17 CPC to amend the prayer clause of  permanent      injunction    restraining    the    defendants     from  dispossessing the appellants forcibly from the disputed house, came  to be dismissed by the High Court, though with a permission to file  a separate suit but the petitioners had not filed any instant suit for  the aforesaid reliefs.  4.4   It is submitted that therefore when the issue in respect to  possession was neither before the Learned Trial Court nor before  the High Court and despite the same observations were made in  para 20 in respect of possession, subsequently the same has been  rightly deleted in exercise of the review jurisdiction. It is submitted  that the Court has an inherent power to correct the error if  subsequently it is bound that some of the observations were made  by error.   5.    By the impugned order the High Court in exercise of powers  under Section 114 read with Order 47 Rule 1 CPC has allowed the  review petition and has reviewed the judgment and order dated  10.12.2013 passed in First Appeal No.241 of 2005 insofar as                                   18   deleting the observations made in Para 20 as regards the  possession of the disputed property, which were in favour of the  appellants – original plaintiffs. From the impugned order passed by  the High Court, it appears that the High Court has deleted the  observations made in para 20 as regards possession of the plaintiffs  mainly/solely on the ground that the issue of possession was  neither before the Learned Trial Court nor was it before the First  Appellate Court and no such issue with respect to possession was  framed by the Learned Trial Court. Therefore, the short question  falls for consideration before this Court is, whether in the facts and  circumstances of the case the High Court is justified in allowing the  review application in exercise of powers under Section 114 read  with Order 47 Rule 1 CPC on the aforesaid grounds?   6.   While considering the aforesaid question, the scope and ambit  of the Court’s power under Section 114 read with Order 47 Rule 1  CPC is required to be considered and for that few decisions of this  Court are required to be referred to.                                      19   6.1   In the case of Haridas Das vs. Usha Rani Banik (Smt.) and  Others, (2006) 4 SCC 78 while considering the scope and ambit of  Section 114 CPC read with Order 47 Rule 1 CPC it is observed and  held in paragraph 14 to 18 as under:             “14. In Meera Bhanja v. Nirmala Kumari Choudhury,           (1995) 1 SCC 170 it was held that:           “8. It is well settled that the review proceedings are not           by way of an appeal and have to be strictly confined to           the scope and ambit of Order 47 Rule 1 CPC. In           connection with the limitation of the powers of the           court under Order 47 Rule 1, while dealing with           similar jurisdiction available to the High Court while           seeking to review the orders under Article 226 of the           Constitution, this Court, in Aribam Tuleshwar Sharma           v. Aribam Pishak Sharma, (1979) 4 SCC 389 speaking           through Chinnappa Reddy, J. has made the following           pertinent observations:            ‘It is true there is nothing in Article 226 of the           Constitution to preclude the High Court from           exercising the power of review which inheres in every           court of plenary jurisdiction to prevent miscarriage of           justice or to correct grave and palpable errors           committed by it. But, there are definitive limits to the           exercise of the power of review. The power of review           may be exercised on the discovery of new and           important matter or evidence which, after the exercise           of due diligence was not within the knowledge of the           person seeking the review or could not be produced by           him at the time when the order was made; it may be           exercised where some mistake or error apparent on the           face of the record is found, it may also be exercised on           any analogous ground. But, it may not be exercised on           the ground that the decision was erroneous on merits.           That would be the province of a court of appeal. A           power of review is not to be confused with appellate           power which may enable an appellate court to correct                            20   all manner of errors committed by the subordinate court.’ ”  15. A perusal of Order 47 Rule 1 shows that review of a judgment or an order could be sought: (a) from the discovery of new and important matters or evidence which after the exercise of due diligence was not within the knowledge of the applicant; (b) such important matter or evidence could not be produced by the applicant at the time when the decree was passed or order made; and (c) on account of some mistake or error apparent on the face of the record or any other sufficient reason.  16. In Aribam Tuleshwar Sharma v. Aribam Pishak Sharma, AIR 1979 SC 1047, this Court held that there are definite limits to the exercise of power of review. In that case, an application under Order 47 Rule 1 read with Section 151 of the Code was filed which was allowed and the order passed by the Judicial Commissioner was set aside and the writ petition was dismissed. On an appeal to this Court it was held as under: (SCC p. 390, para 3)  “It is true as observed by this Court in Shivdeo Singh v. State of Punjab, AIR 1963 SC 1909 there is nothing in Article 226 of the Constitution to preclude a High Court from exercising the power of review which inheres in every court of plenary jurisdiction to prevent miscarriage of justice or to correct grave and palpable errors committed by it. But, there are definitive limits to the exercise of the power of review. The power of review may be exercised on the discovery of new and important matter or evidence which, after the exercise of due diligence was not within the knowledge of the person seeking the review or could not be produced by him at the time when the order was made; it may be exercised where some mistake or error apparent on the face of the record is found; it may also be exercised on any analogous ground. But, it may not be exercised on the ground that the decision was erroneous on merits. That would be the province of a court of appeal. A power of review is not to be confused with appellate                            21   powers which may enable an appellate court to correct all manner of errors committed by the subordinate court.”  17. The judgment in Aribam case has been followed in Meera Bhanja. In that case, it has been reiterated that an error apparent on the face of the record for acquiring jurisdiction to review must be such an error which may strike one on a mere looking at the record and would not require any long­drawn process of reasoning. The following observations in connection with an error apparent on the face of the record in Satyanarayan Laxminarayan Hegde v. Millikarjun Bhavanappa Tirumale, AIR 1960 SC 137 were also noted:  “An error which has to be established by a long­drawn process of reasoning on points where there may conceivably be two opinions can hardly be said to be an error apparent on the face of the record. Where an alleged error is far from self­evident and if it can be established, it has to be established, by lengthy and complicated arguments, such an error cannot be cured by a writ of certiorari according to the rule governing the powers of the superior court to issue such a writ.”  18. It is also pertinent to mention the observations of this Court in Parsion Devi v. Sumitri Devi, (1997) 8 SCC 715. Relying upon the judgments in Aribam and Meera Bhanja it was observed as under:     “9. Under Order 47 Rule 1 CPC a judgment may be     open to review inter alia if there is a mistake or an     error apparent on the face of the record. An error     which is not self­evident and has to be detected by     a process of reasoning, can hardly be said to be an     error apparent on the face of the record justifying     the court to exercise its power of review under     Order 47 Rule 1 CPC. In exercise of the jurisdiction     under Order 47 Rule 1 CPC it is not permissible     for an erroneous decision to be ‘reheard and     corrected’. A review petition, it must be     remembered has a limited purpose and cannot be     allowed to be ‘an appeal in disguise’.”                                      22     6.2   In the case of Lily Thomas vs. Union of India, (2000) 6 SC 224,  it is observed and held that the power of review can be exercised for  correction of a mistake but not to substitute a view. Such powers  can be exercised within the limits of the statute dealing with the  exercise of power.        It is further observed in the said decision that the words “any  other sufficient reason” appearing in Order 47 Rule 1 CPC must  mean “a reason sufficient on grounds at least analogous to those  specified in the rule” as was held in Chhajju Ram vs. Neki, AIR 1922  PC 112 and approved by this Court in Moran Mar Basselios  Catholicos vs Most Rev. Mar Poulose Athanasius, AIR 1954 SC 526.  12.3 In the case of Inderchand Jain vs. Motilal, (2009) 14 SCC 663  in paragraphs 7 to 11 it is observed and held as under:                 7. Section 114 of the Code of Civil Procedure (for short            “the Code”) provides for a substantive power of review by            a civil court and consequently by the appellate courts.            The words “subject as aforesaid” occurring in Section 114            of the Code mean subject to such conditions and            limitations as may be prescribed as appearing in Section            113 thereof and for the said purpose, the procedural            conditions contained in Order 47 of the Code must be            taken into consideration. Section 114 of the Code            although does not prescribe any limitation on the power            of the court but such limitations have been provided for            in Order 47 of the Code; Rule 1 whereof reads as under:                            23       “17. The power of a civil court to review its judgment/decision is traceable in Section 114 CPC. The grounds on which review can be sought are enumerated in Order 47 Rule 1 CPC, which reads as under:     ‘1. Application for review of judgment.—(1) Any person considering himself aggrieved—     (a) by a decree or order from which an appeal is allowed, but from which no appeal has been preferred,     (b) by a decree or order from which no appeal is allowed, or     (c) by a decision on a reference from a Court of Small Causes, and who, from the discovery of new and important matter or evidence which, after the exercise of due diligence, was not within his knowledge or could not be produced by him at the time when the decree was passed or order made, or on account of some mistake or error apparent on the face of the record, or for any other sufficient reason, desires to obtain a review of the decree passed or order made against him, may apply for a review of judgment of the court which passed the decree or made the order.’ ”     8. An application for review would lie inter alia when the order suffers from an error apparent on the face of the record and permitting the same to continue would lead to failure of justice. In Rajendra Kumar v. Rambai this Court held: (SCC p. 514, para 6)     “6. The limitations on exercise of the power of review are well settled. The first and foremost requirement of entertaining a review petition is that the order, review of which is sought, suffers from any error apparent on the face of the order and permitting the order to stand will lead to failure of justice. In the absence of any such error, finality attached to the judgment/order cannot be disturbed.”     9. The power of review can also be exercised by the court in the event discovery of new and important matter or evidence takes place which despite exercise of due diligence was not within the knowledge of the applicant or could not be produced by him at the time when the order was made. An application for review would also lie if the order has been passed on account of some mistake."

Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned           judgment and order dated 20.09.2016 passed by the High Court           of Himachal Pradesh in Criminal Appeal No. 464 of 2012, by           which the High Court has allowed the said appeal preferred by           the respondent – The State of Himachal Pradesh and has Signature Not Verified  Digitally signed by           reversed the judgment and order of acquittal passed by the MEENAKSHI KOHLI Date: 2020.09.25 17:05:28 IST Reason:              learned            trial   Court   and   consequently   has   convicted   the                                                                                       1 appellants – original accused for the offences punishable under  Sections 302 read with 34, 392, 201 and 420, IPC and has  sentenced the appellants herein – original accused to undergo life  imprisonment for the offences punishable under Section 302 read  with 34, IPC, the appellants – original accused have preferred the  present appeal.  2.   That the appellants herein – original accused were charged  for the offences punishable under Sections 302 read with 34,  392, 420 and 201, IPC for having committed the murder of one  Deepak.   That the dead body of the deceased was found on  2.9.2010 near bypass Bihali Road, Chandigarh. That the dead  body was seen by one Jashwinder Singh, PW4, who informed the  police station, Bhunter.    On receiving such information, the  police came on the spot; recorded the statement of PW4; prepared  Rukka and sent the same through Constable Pushparaj, PW2 to  police station, Bhunter. FIR was registered by Head Constable  Tara Chand. That the dead body was identified by the father of  the deceased.     The investigating officer, PW18 conducted the  investigation. The dead body was sent for post mortem.                                                                      2      SHO/SI Narayan received a secret information on 5.9.2010  that one vehicle (jeep) was lying at Chandigarh in abandoned  condition.    IO along with the other police officers went to  Chandigarh and recovered the abandoned vehicle from Sector  45C, Chandigarh. On checking the jeep, one envelope was found  to   have    been    recovered     containing    mobile   phone,      three  photographs and the documents of the vehicle were lying on the  dash board of the jeep. IO took into possession the vehicle and  the documents vide memo. IO dialled from recovered mobile to  his own mobile and the number was detected as 9805523262.  From the recovered photographs, the accused were searched at  place Pandoh Bajaura Aut. Both the accused were arrested on  8.9.2010. During the investigation, the IO recovered the crates  from Punjab.        IO also recovered one knife and the rope on  09.09.2010, alleged to have been used in commission of the  offence.     After    conclusion     of   the   investigation,   IO   filed  chargesheet against the accused persons for the aforesaid  offences.                                                                               3 2.1     To prove the case against the accused, the prosecution  examined in all 9 witnesses, out of 19 witnesses shown in the  chargesheet, details of which are given below:   Sl.No     Name  . 01.       Biri Singh (attesting witness on recovery of cloths) (Ex.           P.W. 2/C & Ex. P.W.2/D) 02        Dinesh Singh (attesting witness on recovery of Jeep,           photographs, Mobile) Ex. P.W. 1/A 03.

P.W. 1/B) 07        Jyoti Kumar, Witness on recovery of crates from Ropar 08        Rajendra Kohli + Sushil Kumar 09        H.C. Pune Ram           The prosecution also brought on record the documentary  evidence of the aforesaid witnesses.       After conclusion of the  recording of the evidence, statement of the accused persons  under Section 313, Cr.P.C. were recorded.          Before the trial Court, the prosecution mainly relied upon  the disclosure statements, recovery of vehicle (jeep), recovery of  knife and rope from the spot, recovery of mobile and photographs  (from the jeep).    Before the trial Court, the case was based on                                                                         4 circumstantial evidence as there was no direct evidence. That on  appreciation of evidence on record, both oral as well as  documentary, the learned trial Court by a detailed reasoning did  not believe the disclosure statements, recovery of knife and rope  alleged to have been used for commission of the offence, recovery  of mobile and the recovery of photographs from the jeep. That on  appreciation of evidence, the learned trial Court found that the  prosecution withheld the material information with respect to the  sniffer dogs and on appreciation of evidence found that the  recoveries were made earlier and the panchnama of the same  were prepared subsequently on which PW5 and PW6 put their  signatures.   Having found that the prosecution has failed to  establish and prove the complete chain of events and that it was  a case of circumstantial evidence, by a detailed judgment and  order, the learned trial Court acquitted both the accused for the  offences for which they were tried.  2.2   On appeal by the State, by the impugned judgment and  order, the High Court has reversed the judgment and order of  acquittal passed by the learned trial Court and consequently has  convicted the accused for the offences punishable under                                                                    5 Sections, 302 read with 34, 392, 420 and 201, IPC.         By the  impugned judgment and order, the High Court has sentenced the  appellants – original accused to undergo life imprisonment for the  offence under Section 302 read with 34, IPC. The High Court has  also sentenced the appellants to undergo rigorous imprisonment  for a period of seven years and to pay a fine of Rs.25,000/­ each  for the offence under Section 392, IPC, and in default of payment  of fine, further rigorous imprisonment for a period of three  months.   The High Court has also sentenced the appellants to  undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of seven years and to  pay a fine of Rs.10,000/­ each for the offence under Section 420,  IPC, and in default of payment of fine, further rigorous  imprisonment for a period of three months. The High Court has  also sentenced the appellants to undergo rigorous imprisonment  for a period of two years and to pay a fine of Rs.5,000/­ each for  the offence under Section 201, IPC, and in default of payment of  fine, further rigorous imprisonment for a period of three months.  However, all the sentences were directed to run concurrently.  2.3   Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned  judgment and order passed by the High Court in reversing the                                                                     6 judgment and order of acquittal and convicting the appellants for  the aforesaid offences, the appellants­original accused have  preferred the present appeal.  3.    Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants­  accused has made the following submissions:       i)     that the High Court has exceeded in its jurisdiction in       reversing the well­reasoned judgment and order of acquittal       passed   by   the   learned   trial   Court   and   consequently       convicting the accused;       ii)    that the High Court has reversed the judgment of the       acquittal on suspicion, surmises and conjectures;       iii)   that the learned trial Court, as such, committed no       error in acquitting the accused;       iv)    that the learned trial Court on appreciation of evidence       disbelieved the recovery of knife and rope at the instance of       the accused and it was held that a very important link of the       chain was missing;       v)     that the learned trial Court gave a specific finding on       appreciation of evidence on doubtful disclosure statements;                                                                       7 vi)     that the High Court has failed to appreciate and  consider that the knife, which is alleged to have been  recovered on the disclosure statements of the accused  persons, had already been recovered on 2.9.2010 with the  help of sniffer dogs, which was established from the evidence  of PW4 and PW5;  vii)    that the High Court ought to have appreciated that the  recovery of knife and rope alleged to have been recovered on  the disclosure statements of the accused persons on  09.09.2010 was concocted one and to fill up the gaps in the  prosecution case;  viii)   that even the recovery of photographs, mobile phone of  PW7 and the jeep from Chandigarh on 6.9.2010 is itself very  doubtful, which came to be considered in detail by the  learned trial Court;  ix)     that even the conduct of Bhuntar police and the IO in  not informing or taking help of the jurisdictional police and  Chandigarh police while conducting investigation in those  areas, as required under Section 166(3) Cr.P.C. and other                                                                  8 lapses has made the entire prosecution case full of doubts  and suspicious;  x)     that even the IO has not tried to examine any  independent witness of Chandigarh, though several people  were there at the time of recovery;  xi)    that even the recovery of mobile of PW7 is very  doubtful.   The IO never tried to find out the call details of  recovered mobile. Even he did not look into call­log of the  mobile himself in order to find out the contact details of the  real culprits. Even the IO did not enquire that after robbing  the mobile of PW7, who were the persons contacted by the  miscreants; how was the mobile used by the accused;  whether the mobile was taken to Ropar by the accused; who  were the persons taking mobile to Chandigarh and kept in  the jeep with the photographs of the appellants? All these  questions could have been easily solved from the call­log/call  details of the mobile if it was really stolen and recovered from  the jeep;  xii)   that even the prosecution has not examined the best  material witnesses like Biri Singh, Dinesh Singh, Lucky,                                                                 9 Subash (the father of the deceased), Ram Pal, Niranjan Singh  and Jyoti Kumar.     It is submitted that non­examination of  material witnesses on recovery and seizure memos has  proved fatal for the prosecution and has created serious  doubts on the prosecution case. It is submitted that there is  absolutely no reason as to why these material witnesses were  not examined by the prosecution, and most of the police  witnesses only were produced in the court, It is submitted  that non­examination of material witnesses is fatal for the  prosecution;  xiii)   that it is an admitted position that it is a case of  circumstantial evidence.    Therefore, before convicting the  accused, the prosecution has to prove the complete chain of  events which will lead to the only conclusion that it is the  accused who alone has committed the offence.            It is  submitted that in the present case the prosecution as such  has failed to complete the chain of events; and  xiv)    that there are material contradictions and even the  recovery of jeep, knife and rope, photographs from the jeep,  as observed and held by the learned trial Court, is doubtful                                                              10       and creates serious doubts and therefore the learned trial        Court rightly acquitted the accused, which ought not to have        interfered with by the High Court.  3.1    Making the above submissions and taking us to the  deposition of PW4, PW5 and PW18 and relying upon the  decisions of this Court in the cases of Babu v. State of Kerala,  (2010) 9 SCC 189; Bannareddy v. State of Karnataka (2018) 5  SCC 790; State of Rajasthan v. Mukesh Kumar alias Mahesh  Dhaulpuria (2019) 7 SCC 678; and State of Rajasthan v. Madan  alias Madaniya, (2019) 13 SCC 653,         it is prayed to allow the  present appeal and set aside the impugned judgment and order  passed by the High Court and restore the well­reasoned  judgment and order of acquittal passed by the learned trial  Court.  4.     The present appeal is vehemently opposed by the learned  counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent – State of  Himachal Pradesh.  4.1    It is submitted that in the present case the High Court has  after re­appreciation of entire evidence on record, found the  accused guilty for the unnatural death of Deepak Kumar                                                                    11 deceased. It is submitted that as such the re­appreciation of the  entire evidence by the first appellate court is permissible;  4.2    It is submitted that the High Court, on re­appraisal of the  entire     evidence   on   record,   has   considered   the   following  circumstances pointing to the guilt of the accused:        a)     recovery of jeep, mobile phone and photographs from              Chandigarh       b)     recovery of weapon of offence on the disclosure              statement of appellant no.1 – Anwar Ali       c)     recovery of crates on the disclosure statement of              appellant no.1 – Anwar Ali       d)     recovery of clothes of accused       e)     medical evidence       f)     no defence evidence led   4.3    It is submitted that the High Court has given cogent reasons  while considering the afore­stated circumstances against the  accused. It is submitted that the High Court has convicted the  accused on re­appreciation of the entire evidence on record, more  particularly the deposition of PW1, PW3, PW4, PW5, PW11 and  PW18.  4.4    Now so far as the submission on behalf of the accused on  non­examination of independent witnesses at the time of recovery  and non­compliance of the provisions of Section 100(4) Cr.P.C.  and other related provisions is concerned, it is submitted by the                                                                       12 learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent­State that  the persons who were gathered at the time of recovery were mere  spectators and none had come forward to act as a witness in the  matter.        It is submitted that even otherwise as held by this Court in  the case of Ronny v. State of Maharashtra, (1998) 3 SCC 625 that  even if the witness has been brought by the investigating agency  along with them, they cannot be disbelieved only on that ground.  4.5   In the alternative, it is submitted by the learned counsel  appearing on behalf of the respondent­State that non­compliance  of the directory provisions contained in Section 100 Cr.P.C. can  at the most be treated as defective investigation but that cannot  come in the way of dispensation of justice.     Heavy reliance is  placed upon the decision of this Court in the case of C.  Muniappan v. State of Tamil Nadu, (2010) 9 SCC 567 (para 55).        It is submitted that as held by this Court in the case of  State of Punjab v. Balbir Singh, (1994) 3 SCC 299 (para 6), a  defective investigation if any does not vitiate the trial.   It is  submitted that as held by this Court in the case of Sudha  Renukaiah v. State of Andhra Pradesh, (2017) 13 SCC 81, in                                                                    13 which the decision in the case of Muniappan (supra) was relied  upon, that even if the IO has committed any error and has been  negligent in carrying out any investigation or in the investigation  there is some omission and defect, it is the legal obligation on the  part of the court to examine the prosecution evidence de hors  such lapses.  4.5   It is further submitted that in the present case the recovery  of weapon of offence; recovery of jeep; recovery of photographs  and the stolen mobile phone of PW7; recovery of crates have been  established and proved by the prosecution beyond doubt by  examining the relevant witnesses, which as such, were not  believed by the learned trial Court for minor contradictions. It is  submitted that therefore the order of acquittal passed by the  learned trial Court warranted interference by the High Court.  4.6   Now so far as the submission on behalf of the accused that  in the present case the High Court has committed a grave error  in interfering with the order of acquittal passed by the learned  trial Court is concerned, it is submitted that in the present case  of circumstantial evidence, the factum probandum or the primary  fact stands established and having regard to the common cause  and natural events and to human conduct and their relations,                                                                   14 the complete chain of circumstances indicating the guilt of the  accused is established. Reliance is placed upon the decision of  this Court in the case of G. Parshwanath v. State of Karnataka,  (2010) 8 SCC 593 (paragraphs 22 to 24).       Heavy reliance is also placed on the recent decision of this  Court in the case of Vijay Mohan Singh v. State of Karnataka,  (2019) 5 SCC 436, paragraphs 30, 31. 31.1, 31.2, 31.3, 31.4 and  32 of the said decision.   It is submitted that in the aforesaid  decision, after considering the entire law on interference by the  High Court with an order of acquittal, it is observed and held that  once the appeal is entertained against the order of acquittal, the  High Court would be entitled to re­appreciate the entire evidence  independently and come to its own conclusion. However,  ordinarily, the High Court would give due importance to the  opinion of the Sessions Judge if the same was arrived at after  proper appreciation of the evidence.    It is submitted that it is  further observed that where the Sessions Judge has absolutely  made a wrong assumption of a very material and clinching aspect  in the peculiar circumstances of the case and if the High Court is  satisfied that the order of acquittal passed by the learned trial  Court is perverse and suffers from infirmities, it is always open                                                                  15 for the High Court to interfere with the order of acquittal passed  by the learned trial Court.  4.8   Making the above submissions and relying upon the  aforesaid decisions of this Court, it is prayed to dismiss the  present appeal.  5.    We have heard the learned counsel for the respective parties  at length.    We have gone through in detail the judgment and  order of acquittal passed by the learned trial Court as well as the  impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court  interfering with the order of acquittal passed by the learned trial  Court and thereby convicting the accused.         we have also gone  through      the   relevant   evidences,   both   oral   as   well   as  documentary.  5.1   At the outset, it is required to be noted that this is a case of  reversal of acquittal by the High Court in a case of circumstantial  evidence.     Therefore, the first and foremost thing which is  required to be considered is, whether in the facts and  circumstances of the case, the High Court is justified in  interfering with the order of acquittal passed by the learned trial  Court?                                                                         16 5.2     Before considering the appeal on merits, the law on the  appeal against acquittal and the scope and ambit of Section 378  Cr.P.C. and the interference by the High Court in an appeal  against acquittal is required to be considered.  5.2.1        In the case of Babu (supra), this Court had reiterated  the principles to be followed in an appeal against acquittal under  Section 378 Cr.P.C. In paragraphs 12 to 19, it is observed and  held as under:        12. This Court time and again has laid down the guidelines for the       High Court to interfere with the judgment and order of acquittal       passed by the trial court. The appellate court should not ordinarily       set aside a judgment of acquittal in a case where two views are       possible, though the view of the appellate court may be the more       probable one. While dealing with a judgment of acquittal, the       appellate court has to consider the entire evidence on record, so as       to arrive at a finding as to whether the views of the trial court were       perverse or otherwise unsustainable. The appellate court is entitled       to consider whether in arriving at a finding of fact, the trial court       had failed to take into consideration admissible evidence and/or       had taken into consideration the evidence brought on record       contrary to law. Similarly, wrong placing of burden of proof may       also be a subject­matter of scrutiny by the appellate court. (Vide       Balak Ram v. State of U.P (1975) 3 SCC 219, Shambhoo Missir v.       State of Bihar (1990) 4 SCC 17, Shailendra Pratap v. State of U.P       (2003) 1 SCC 761, Narendra Singh v. State of M.P (2004) 10 SCC       699, Budh Singh v. State of U.P (2006) 9 SCC 731, State of U.P. v.       Ram Veer Singh (2007) 13 SCC 102, S. Rama Krishna v. S. Rami       Reddy (2008) 5 SCC 535, Arulvelu v. State (2009) 10 SCC 206,       Perla Somasekhara Reddy v. State of A.P (2009) 16 SCC 98 and       Ram Singh v. State of H.P (2010) 2 SCC 445)       13. In Sheo Swarup v. King Emperor AIR 1934 PC 227, the Privy       Council observed as under: (IA p. 404)       “… the High Court should and will always give proper weight and       consideration to such matters as (1) the views of the trial Judge as       to the credibility of the witnesses; (2) the presumption of innocence       in favour of the accused, a presumption certainly not weakened by                                                                                 17 the fact that he has been acquitted at his trial; (3) the right of the accused to the benefit of any doubt; and (4) the slowness of an appellate court in disturbing a finding of fact arrived at by a Judge who had the advantage of seeing the witnesses.” 14. The aforesaid principle of law has consistently been followed by this Court. (See Tulsiram Kanu v. State AIR 1954 SC 1, Balbir Singh v. State of Punjab AIR 1957 SC 216, M.G. Agarwal v. State of Maharashtra AIR 1963 SC 200, Khedu Mohton v. State of Bihar (1970) 2 SCC 450, Sambasivan v. State of Kerala (1998) 5 SCC 412, Bhagwan Singh v. State of M.P(2002) 4 SCC 85 and State of Goa v. Sanjay Thakran (2007) 3 SCC 755) 15. In Chandrappa v. State of Karnataka (2007) 4 SCC 415, this Court reiterated the legal position as under: (SCC p. 432, para 42) “(1) An appellate court has full power to review, reappreciate and reconsider the evidence upon which the order of acquittal is founded. (2) The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 puts no limitation, restriction or condition on exercise of such power and an appellate court on the evidence before it may reach its own conclusion, both on questions of fact and of law. (3) Various expressions, such as, ‘substantial and compelling reasons’, ‘good and sufficient grounds’, ‘very strong circumstances’, ‘distorted conclusions’, ‘glaring mistakes’, etc. are not intended to curtail extensive powers of an appellate court in an appeal against acquittal. Such phraseologies are more in the nature of ‘flourishes of language’ to emphasise the reluctance of an appellate court to interfere with acquittal than to curtail the power of the court to review the evidence and to come to its own conclusion. (4) An appellate court, however, must bear in mind that in case of acquittal, there is double presumption in favour of the accused. Firstly, the presumption of innocence is available to him under the fundamental principle of criminal jurisprudence that every person shall be presumed to be innocent unless he is proved guilty by a competent court of law. Secondly, the accused having secured his acquittal, the presumption of his innocence is further reinforced, reaffirmed and strengthened by the trial court. (5) If two reasonable conclusions are possible on the basis of the evidence on record, the appellate court should not disturb the finding of acquittal recorded by the trial court.” 16. In Ghurey Lal v. State of U.P (2008) 10 SCC 450, this Court reiterated the said view, observing that the appellate court in dealing with the cases in which the trial courts have acquitted the accused, should bear in mind that the trial court’s acquittal bolsters the presumption that he is innocent. The appellate court must give due weight and consideration to the decision of the trial court as the trial court had the distinct advantage of watching the                                                                           18     demeanour of the witnesses, and was in a better position to     evaluate the credibility of the witnesses.     17. In State of Rajasthan v. Naresh (2009) 9 SCC 368, the Court     again examined the earlier judgments of this Court and laid down     that: (SCC p. 374, para 20)     “20. … an order of acquittal should not be lightly interfered with     even if the court believes that there is some evidence pointing out     the finger towards the accused.”     18. In State of U.P. v. Banne (2009) 4 SCC 271, this Court gave     certain illustrative circumstances in which the Court would be     justified in interfering with a judgment of acquittal by the High     Court. The circumstances include: (SCC p. 286, para 28)     “(i) The High Court’s decision is based on totally erroneous view of     law by ignoring the settled legal position;     (ii) The High Court’s conclusions are contrary to evidence and     documents on record;     (iii) The entire approach of the High Court in dealing with the     evidence was patently illegal leading to grave miscarriage of justice;     (iv) The High Court’s judgment is manifestly unjust and     unreasonable based on erroneous law and facts on the record of     the case;     (v) This Court must always give proper weight and consideration to     the findings of the High Court;     (vi) This Court would be extremely reluctant in interfering with a     case when both the Sessions Court and the High Court have     recorded an order of acquittal.”     A similar view has been reiterated by this Court in Dhanapal v.     State (2009) 10 SCC 401.     19. Thus, the law on the issue can be summarised to the effect     that in exceptional cases where there are compelling     circumstances, and the judgment under appeal is found to be     perverse, the appellate court can interfere with the order of     acquittal. The appellate court should bear in mind the     presumption of innocence of the accused and further that the trial     court’s acquittal bolsters the presumption of his innocence.     Interference in a routine manner where the other view is possible     should be avoided, unless there are good reasons for interference.”                                             (emphasis supplied)  5.2.2      When the findings of fact recorded by a court can be  held to be perverse has been dealt with and considered in  paragraph 20 of the aforesaid decision, which reads as under:                                                                               19       “20. The findings of fact recorded by a court can be held to be       perverse if the findings have been arrived at by ignoring or       excluding relevant material or by taking into consideration       irrelevant/inadmissible material. The finding may also be said to       be perverse if it is “against the weight of evidence”, or if the finding       so outrageously defies logic as to suffer from the vice of       irrationality. (Vide Rajinder Kumar Kindra v. Delhi Admn (1984) 4       SCC 635, Excise and Taxation Officer­cum­Assessing Authority v.       Gopi Nath & Sons 1992 Supp (2) SCC 312, Triveni Rubber & Plastics       v. CCE 1994 Supp. (3) SCC 665, Gaya Din v. Hanuman Prasad       (2001) 1 SCC 501, Aruvelu v. State (2009) 10 SCC 206 and Gamini       Bala Koteswara Rao v. State of A.P (2009) 10 SCC 636).”                                                      (emphasis supplied)   5.2.3        It is further observed, after following the decision of  this Court in the case of Kuldeep Singh v. Commissioner of Police  (1999) 2 SCC 10, that if a decision is arrived at on the basis of no  evidence or thoroughly unreliable evidence and no reasonable  person would act upon it, the order would be perverse. But if  there is some evidence on record which is acceptable and which  could be relied upon, the conclusions would not be treated as  perverse and the findings would not be interfered with.  5.3     In the recent decision of Vijay Mohan Singh (supra), this  Court again had an occasion to consider the scope of Section 378  Cr.P.C. and the interference by the High Court in an appeal  against acquittal. This Court considered catena of decisions of  this Court right from 1952 onwards.                  In paragraph 31, it is  observed and held as under:                                                                                   20 “31. An identical question came to be considered before this Court in Umedbhai Jadavbhai (1978) 1 SCC 228. In the case before this Court, the High Court interfered with the order of acquittal passed by the learned trial court on re­appreciation of the entire evidence on record. However, the High Court, while reversing the acquittal, did not consider the reasons given by the learned trial court while acquitting the accused. Confirming the judgment of the High Court, this Court observed and held in para 10 as under: (SCC p. 233)    “10. Once the appeal was rightly entertained against the order of    acquittal, the High Court was entitled to reappreciate the entire    evidence independently and come to its own conclusion.    Ordinarily, the High Court would give due importance to the    opinion of the Sessions Judge if the same were arrived at after    proper appreciation of the evidence. This rule will not be    applicable in the present case where the Sessions Judge has    made an absolutely wrong assumption of a very material and    clinching aspect in the peculiar circumstances of the case.” 31.1. In Sambasivan v. State of Kerala (1998) 5 SCC 412, the High Court reversed the order of acquittal passed by the learned trial court and held the accused guilty on re­appreciation of the entire evidence on record, however, the High Court did not record its conclusion on the question whether the approach of the trial court in dealing with the evidence was patently illegal or the conclusions arrived at by it were wholly untenable. Confirming the order passed by the High Court convicting the accused on reversal of the acquittal passed by the learned trial court, after being satisfied that the order of acquittal passed by the learned trial court was perverse and suffered from infirmities, this Court declined to interfere with the order of conviction passed by the High Court. While confirming the order of conviction passed by the High Court, this Court observed in para 8 as under: (SCC p. 416)    “8. We have perused the judgment under appeal to ascertain    whether the High Court has conformed to the aforementioned    principles. We f"

SHAH, J.                            Having doubted the correctness of the decision of this Court in the case of            Mohan Lal v. State of Punjab reported in (2018) 17 SCC 627 taking the view            that in case the investigation is conducted by the police officer who himself is            the complainant, the trial is vitiated and the accused is entitled to acquittal, Signature Not Verified  Digitally signed by            initially by order dated 17.01.2019 the matter was referred to a larger Bench Charanjeet kaur Date: 2020.08.31 18:19:25 IST Reason:               consisting of three Judges. A three Judge Bench vide order dated 12.09.2019                                                                                  2   has referred to a larger Bench of five Judges to consider the matter. That is why,  the present matter is placed before the Bench consisting of five Judges.  2.     At the outset, it is required to be noted that the decision of this Court in  the case of Mohan Lal (supra) taking the view that in case the investigation is  conducted by the police officer who himself is the complainant, the trial is  vitiated and the accused is entitled to acquittal, came up for consideration  subsequently before this Court in the case of Varinder Kumar v. State of  Himachal Pradesh 2019 (3) SCALE 50 = (2020) 3 SCC 321 and a three Judge  Bench of this Court [out of which two Hon’ble Judges were also in the Bench in  the case of Mohan Lal (supra)] held that the decision of this Court in the case of  Mohan Lal (supra) shall be applicable prospectively, meaning thereby, all  pending criminal prosecutions, trials and appeals prior to the law laid down in  Mohan Lal (supra) shall continue to be governed by individual facts of the case.  The relevant observations in the case of Varinder Kumar (supra) to be referred  and considered hereinbelow.  3.     Shri Sushil Kumar Jain, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of  the accused – Devendra Singh has made the following submissions in support of  his submission that as rightly held by this Court in the case of Mohan Lal  (supra) in a given case where the complainant himself has conducted the  investigation the entire trial would be vitiated and the accused would be entitled  to acquittal:                                                                                   3   3.1   The decision in Mohan Lal (supra) rests and is based upon substantive  constitutional foundation and principles of criminal jurisprudence. In the said  decision in para 5, this Court specifically dealt with and considered the question  whether in a criminal prosecution, it will be in consonance with the principles of  justice, fair play and a fair investigation, if the informant and the investigating  officer were to be the same person and in such a case, is it necessary for the  accused to demonstrate prejudice, especially under laws such as the NDPS Act,  carrying a reverse burden of proof. In the said decision, this Court considered  in detail the reverse burden of proof under Sections 35 and 54 of the NDPS Act.  That thereafter, this Court had considered in detail the constitutional guarantee  of fair trial to an accused under Article 21 which takes within its fold “Fair  Investigation”. Thereafter it is observed by this Court that in the nature of the  reverse burden of proof, the onus will lie on the prosecution to demonstrate on  the face of it that the investigation was fair, judicious with no circumstances that  may raise doubts about its veracity.         It is further observed that if the  investigation itself is unfair, to require the accused to demonstrate prejudice will  be fraught with danger vesting arbitrary powers in the police which may well  lead to false implication also. Thereafter this Court considered in paragraphs 17  and 29 the role and obligations of the investigator and the investigation itself.  Thereafter after having placed reliance on the decisions of this Court in the  cases of Bhagwan Singh v. State of Rajasthan (1976) 1 SCC 15; Megha Singh v.  State of Haryana (1996) 11 SCC 709; and State by Inspector of Police, NIB,                                                                                    4   Tamil Nadu v. Rajangam (2010) 15 SCC 369, this Court specifically observed  and held that in case the investigation is conducted by the police officer who  himself is the complainant, the trial is vitiated and the accused is entitled to  acquittal. In the said decision, it is specifically observed that to leave the matter  for being determined on the individual facts of a case, may not only lead to a  possible abuse of powers but more importantly will leave the police, the  accused, the lawyer and the courts in a state of uncertainty and confusion which  has to be avoided. Thereafter it is held that a fair investigation which is but the  very foundation of a fair trial, necessarily postulates that the informant and the  investigator must not be the same person. Justice must not only be done, but  must appear to be done also. Any possibility of bias or a pre-determined  conclusion has to be excluded. This requirement is all the more imperative in  laws carrying a reverse burden of proof;  3.2   The reasons which found favour in Mohan Lal (supra) are inherent and  inbuilt by the legislature in Chapter V – “Procedure”, which would be the “…  procedure established by law” for the purpose of Article 21;  3.3   As is now settled after the decision in the case of Menaka Gandhi v.  Union of India (1978) 1 SCC 248 that the procedure established by law under  Article 21 cannot be “any procedure” but has to be a just and a reasonable  procedure and hence right of the accused to have a fair and independent                                                                                 5   investigation and trial, being inherent has been “read into” into the statutes not  confirming to fair procedure to make them constitutionally compatible;  3.4   Learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the accused has  thereafter taken us to the “Scheme” of the NDPS Act, more particularly Section  8(c) and Sections 15 to 22.      He submitted that Section 54 gives rise to a  presumption that the accused has committed an offence under the Act and  places a reverse burden of proof upon an accused “found” to be in possession  and which he fails to account for satisfactorily. Section 35 mandates the Court  to culpable mental state unless contrary is proved. It is submitted that thus  “recovery” and “possession” becomes an important and vital aspect of  investigation under the NDPS Act. If the accused is “found” to be in possession  of the prohibited substance, Section 54 gives rise to a presumption of  commission of offence and Section 35 gives rise to a presumption of culpable  mental state.   The officer or the raiding party which effects recovery are  witnesses to the said fact which would constitute an offence and therefore  investigation of the said aspect has to be carried out by an independent agency.  Investigation being a systemic process and not a forgone conclusion making the  FIR itself lodged by the informant who himself effects recoveries to be treated  as a gospel truth;  3.5   In order to safeguard the interest of the accused, the legislation has  provided inbuilt safeguards under the NDPS Act.           That the Act requires                                                                                  6   recovery and investigation to be made by different officers, i.e., by officers  empowered under Section 42 and 53. The role of an officer under Section 42  being limited to effect “entry”, “search”, “seizure” and “arrest”. It is submitted  that an officer under Section 42 has no power of investigation;  3.6   That Section 52(3) requires an officer under Section 42 to handover every  person arrested or article seized to an officer empowered under Section 53 (who  has been conferred with power of investigation under the Act) or an officer in  charge of a police station who has power of investigation under the Cr.P.C. At  the stage when the officer under Section 42 is required to handover the person  arrested or the articles seized by him to the officer in charge of a police station  or the officer under Section 53 of the NDPS Act, the information given by him  to such officers would then be categorised as the first information report. As the  investigation starts on information relating to commission of an offence given to  an officer in charge of a police station and recorded under Section 154 Cr.P.C.  3.7   A cryptic message on telephone etc. which under the NDPS Act is similar  to the information provided by a secret informer etc. cannot therefore constitute  an FIR. It is only after recoveries are effected and/or arrests made, information  regarding commission of a cognizable offence crystallises. After such handing  over, the Role of a Section 42 officer comes to an end, except he has to make a  report of his action to his superior officer within 48 hours under Section 57 of  the NDPS Act. For all practical purposes, the time when Section 42 officer                                                                                 7   hands over the person arrested or the goods seized, is the first-time information  is received by the “investigating officer” and that is the time of commencement  of investigation. Heavy reliance is placed upon the decisions of this Court in  the cases of H.N. Rishbud v. State of Delhi AIR 1955 SC 196; and Manu  Sharma v. State (NCT of Delhi) (2010) 6 SCC 1;  3.8   If the officer under Section 41(2) or Section 42 receives some secret  information, he is statutorily required to inform the same under Section 42(2) of  the Act to his superior officer after 72 hours. The officer is not obliged and  cannot be compelled to give the source of his information in view of the bar  contained in Section 68 of the Act. Thus, there is no mechanism to verify,  except the oral testimony of Section 42 officer himself or his subordinate  officers who are part of his raiding party, that he has acted on some prior secret  information or that the recovery etc. was a chance recovery or that the officer  was acting maliciously for extraneously. Even after effecting arrests or seizures,  while the officer under Section 42 is required to forward the articles seized and  persons arrested “without unnecessary delay” to the investigation officers, he is  required to report to his immediate superior officer in 48 hours. Thus, there is  no person other than the officer under Section 42 who is the “complainant”, i.e.,  the one who alleges commission of a cognizable offence based on the arrests  and the recoveries effected by himself or his raiding party. He is the witness  who “claims” seizures/recovery of prohibited substances from possession of the                                                                                 8   accused. These claims are required to be verified and substantiated during  investigation by the investigating officer. Once the person arrested and the  articles seized come in the control of the “Investigating Officer”, he is required  under Section 52(4) of the Act to take measures for their disposal. The person  arrested is produced before the magistrate under Section 167 Cr.P.C. and the  narcotic substance seized is then required to be dealt with by the officer under  Section 53 of the NDPS Act or the SHO in accordance with Section 52A. In the  process of investigation, the conduct of the officer under Sections 42, 43 and 44  is also required to be investigated. If after investigation it is found that the  claim made by the complainant/informant is justified, he would file a police  report against the accused for offences under the Act, however, in case he finds  that the officer under Section 42 has acted vexatiously or maliciously, he can  also be punished under Section 58 and therefore he would file a police report  against such officer for offence under Section 58. The offence under Section 58  is also a cognizable offence and hence on an allegation made the “officer in  charge of police station” is under an obligation to take cognizance of that and  investigate. An independent investigation by a separate agency lends credibility  and fairness to both the sides. If the officer under Section 42 is to be proceeded  against, his trial would also be based upon “investigated” material. It would  also exclude possibility of abuse and source of corruption due to the wide  powers under the NDPS Act;                                                                                9   3.9   Handing over or continuation of investigation by the officer who has  acted under Section 42 to effect search, seizure or arrest is not therefore be  comprehended under the scheme.        It would render Section 58 completely  redundant and otiose as he would not investigate against himself and file a  chargesheet against himself. If the accused is not found to be in possession, the  Investigating Officer would have to explain his source or else “possession” of a  contraband in his possession would also attract Section 8. The scheme of  making two separate sections i.e. Sections 42 and 53 empowering officers for  different purposes would have been unnecessary. If the legislative intent was  such, officer under Section 42 would have been given an additional power of  investigation and then Section 53 was unnecessary;  3.10 There was no need for a provision like Section 52(3) which mandates  handover of articles seized and persons arrested to a SHO or an officer under  Section 53;  3.11 NDPS Act does not contemplate “Joint Authorisations”, for if that were  the case, Section 42 would have conferred power of both “entry, search, seizure  or arrest” as well as “investigation” on the same officer. The very fact that two  separate sections, namely, Section 42 and Section 53 have been provided and  Section 52(3) contemplates “handing over” by Section 42 officer to either  Section 53 officer or to SHO, meaning thereby that there ought to be two  separate officers;                                                                                  10   3.12 The object of “fair and independent investigation” is to unearth the truth.  The “fair and independent investigation” is a right of an accused flowing from  Article 21 of the Constitution. Reliance is placed upon the decisions of this  Court in the case of Romila Thapar v. Union of India (2018) 10 SCC 753 (para  67); Manu Sharma (supra)(paras 200 to 202); Hema v. State (2013) 10 SCC  192 (para 10); and Babubhai v. State of Gujarat (2010) 12 SCC 254 (para 32);  3.13   “Liberty” of a person would be at serious peril if the scheme of the  NDPS Act is interpreted and left over in the hands of a single person without  any checks and safeguards to protect the rights of the accused.                It is  impermissible and beyond comprehension to allow a person to (i) make an  accusation; (ii) the fact that he accuses is “sufficient ingredient” to make a penal  offence; (iii) “investigate” that accusation which he himself makes; and (iv)  become a “witness” to prove the accusation and then based on his testimony a  person is convicted and punished;  3.14 In order to bring home a conviction under the provisions of the NDPS  Act, prosecution is required to establish ingredients of an offence “beyond  reasonable doubt”;  3.15 If the defence of the accused is not properly investigated to rule out all  other possibilities, it cannot ever be said that the prosecution has established the  guilt “beyond reasonable doubt”. A tainted investigation by a complaint who is  a “witness” himself to a substantial ingredient of an offence, would in fact give                                                                                   11   rise to a “doubt” and it is impossible that the case can be established on the  parameter of “beyond reasonable doubt”;  3.16 A person accused of criminal offence punishable with a peril to his life or  liberty, enjoys certain rights under the Constitution or through long standing  development of criminal jurisprudence. Any action which impinges or affects  those rights would be said to cause “prejudice to an accused”. That in the case  of Rafiq Ahmad v. State of U.P (2011) 8 SCC 300, it is observed and held that  prejudice to an accused or failure of justice has to be examined with reference to  (i) right to fair trial (ii) presumption of innocence until pronouncement of guilt  and (iii) the standards of proof. It is observed in the said decision that whenever  a plea of prejudice is raised by the accused, it must be examined with reference  to the above rights and safeguards, as it is the violation of these rights alone that  may result in the weakening of the case of the prosecution and benefit to the  accused in accordance with law;  3.17 Section 457 Cr.P.C. in effect saves an order of conviction and sentence  despite there being an error, omission or irregularity in the complaint, summons,  warrant, proclamation, order, judgment or other proceedings before or during  trial or in any inquiry or other proceedings under Cr.P.C., or in any sanction for  the prosecution unless in the opinion of the Court “failure of justice” has been  occasioned thereby. According to the prosecution therefore before an order of  conviction and sentence is set aside the Court must be satisfied that there is a                                                                               12   “actual prejudice” caused to the accused. However, Section 457 Cr.P.C. does  not include within its fold the term “investigation” which has been specifically  defined under Section 2(h) separate from inquiry defined under Section 2(g).  Section 457 contemplates errors committed in judicial proceedings before or  during the commencement of trial and not “investigation” by the officers of the  police etc. Heavy reliance is placed upon the decision of this Court in the case  of Willie (William) Staney v. The State of Madhya Pradesh 1955 SCR 1140 on  the test for “failure of justice”. Therefore allowing the informant/complainant  to be the investigator in which he could himself faced prosecution if  independently investigated would not only violate the fundamental principles of  fair trial which includes fair investigation, but would be a denial of an  opportunity of getting      the defence investigated and hence would also be  abhorrent to the well-established notion of natural justice rendering the trial a  mockery.  3.18 Making the above submissions and relying upon the aforesaid decisions,  it is submitted that the law laid down by this Court in the case of Mohan Lal  (supra) taking the view that in case the investigation is conducted by the police  officer who himself is the complainant, the trial is vitiated and the accused is  entitled to acquittal is a correct law.                                                                                13   4.    Shri Ajay Garg, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of Mukesh Singh  has made the following additional submissions other than the submissions made  by Shri Sushil Kumar Jain, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the accused;  4.1   Right from Bhagwan Singh (supra) till the recent judgment in the case of  Varinder Kumar (supra), this Court is of the firm view that the  complainant/informant and the investigator must not be the same person. The  same is in consonance with the age-old principles of law that “Nemo  debetessejudex in causa proporiasua” (no person can be a judge in his own  cause) and that “justice should not only be done but appears to have been done”;  4.2   The aforesaid principles of law are touchstone of the principles of natural  justice and is a useful tool to maintain free, fair and unbiased investigation and  adjudication across legal systems;  4.3   Considering the scheme of the NDPS Act, more particularly Sections 41,  42, 43, 52(3) and 53 of the Act require that the officer empowered to raid, seize  and arrest who may be the complainant shall be different from the investigator  of the case;  4.4   The criminal proceedings stand vitiated if the complainant/informant and  the investigator of the case is the same person in view of the following reasons:        a)       If the complainant/informer and the Investigator are same       persons, it will violate the principle of Rule against Bias which is a       part of Principles of Natural Justice and included in Fundamental                                                                           14   Right enshrined in Article 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India. In this regard he is relying upon para 14, 18 and 31 of Mohan Lal (Supra). b)     In such case like NDPS where there is reverse burden of proof in sections 35, 54, 66 and 68, the burden shall be on the prosecution to prove that no prejudice is caused to the accused in the investigation conducted by the complainant/Informer. In this regard he is relying upon para 14 and 18 of Mohan Lal (Supra). c)     In such case, the complainant will always be interested in filing charge sheet against the accused (which is normal human behavior). He will have personal bias against the accused and there will be no objectivity in the Investigation. He is relying upon Megha Singh (Supra), Bhagwan Singh (supra), Mohan Lal (supra). d)     This Hon’ble Court has consistently considered this as a serious infraction to the guaranteed constitutional rights of accused and declared it to be the grave infirmity which reflects on the credibility of the prosecution case.e)     Giving due weightage as observed in Mukeshsingh (supra) will   have   same    result   because   if   the   evidence   of   the Complainant/Investigating officer is discarded, nothing remains in the prosecution case and the entire Criminal proceedings stands vitiated. f)     The Accused will be deprived of his valuable rights of cross examining the complainant/informer and the Investigation officer separately if both are same.      Further, the accused will also be deprived of his valuable right of contradicting the previous information recorded under section 154 or 155 Cr.P.C. and previous statements of the witnesses, being a police officer, complaint                                                                                 15         recorded under section 151 Cr.P.C. enjoined in section 145 and 157       of Indian Evidence Act and proviso to section 152 Cr.P.C.       g)     The meaningful reading of the scheme of NDPS Act as       discussed above also indicate that the Informer/complainant/raiding       officer cannot Investigate the said case.       h)     There is no compulsion for the Police/any other agency to get       the Investigation conducted by the complainant/informer and on the       other hand it can be an easy tool of false implication.       i)     Investigating Officer could not be placed on any pedestal       higher than of a complainant and the complainant himself cannot be       the sole agency of investigation.           The whole bedrock of the       investigation on the basis of which the appellant has been prosecuted       is found be unfair and against the basic tenets of criminal       jurisprudence, the conviction and sentence based on such a highly       infirm investigation as aforesaid cannot be sustained in the eye of       law and accordingly the whole proceedings based on such       investigation as aforesaid deserve to be quashed and set aside.   5.    Shri Tushar Mehta, learned Solicitor General of India has made the  following submissions:  5.1   Section 2(h) defines “investigation”.       “Investigation” includes all the  proceedings under the Cr.P.C. for the collection of evidence conducted by a  police officer or by any person other than a magistrate who is authorised by a  magistrate in this behalf. Section 2(o) defines “officer in charge of a police  station” and it includes when the officer in charge of the police station is absent  from the station-house or unable from illness or other cause to perform his                                                                                  16   duties, the police officer present at the station-house who is next in rank to such  officer and is above the rank of a constable or, when the State Government so  directs, any other police officer so present. It is submitted that under Cr.P.C.,  the criminal law is set into motion either under Chapter XII which relates to  information to police officers; or Chapter XV which relates to complaints to  magistrates.   The present case relates to Chapter XII, Cr.P.C. where the  informant of the offence is a police officer;  5.2   As per Section 154 Cr.P.C., every information relating to the commission  of a cognizable offence, if given orally to an officer in charge of a police station  shall be reduced in writing by him or under his direction, and be read over to the  informant; and every such information, whether given in writing or reduced in  writing shall be signed by the person giving it, and the substance thereof shall  be entered in a book to be kept by such officer in such form as the State  Government may prescribe in this behalf. As per sub-section 3 of Section 154  Cr.P.C., any person aggrieved by a refusal on the part of an officer in charge of a  police station to record the information referred to in sub-section 1 may send  the substance of such information, in writing and by post to the Superintendent  of Police concerned, who if satisfied that such information discloses the  commission of a cognizable offence shall either investigate the case himself or  direct an investigation to be made by any police officer subordinate to him and                                                                                   17   such officer shall have all the powers of an officer in charge of the police station  in relation to that offence;  5.3   Section 156 Cr.P.C. provides that any officer in charge of a police station  may investigate a cognizable offence without an order of the magistrate. Thus,  even where the FIR under Section 154 Cr.P.C. is registered at the instance of a  police officer, there is no bar under Section 156 Cr.P.C. to an officer in charge of  a police station to investigate the same.       Further, the competence of such  investigating officer cannot be called in question in any proceedings;  5.4   Section 157 Cr.P.C. provides that if some information received or  otherwise, an officer in charge of a police station has reason to suspect the  commission of an offence which he is empowered under Section 156 of the  Code to investigate, he shall proceed in person to the spot to investigate and if  necessary to take measures for the discovery and arrest of the offender. Thus,  an officer in charge of a police station who himself receives information of  commission of cognizable offence is empowered to investigate the case. It is  submitted that thus, under the scheme of Cr.P.C., there is no bar on a police  officer receiving information of commission of a cognizable offence, recording  the same and then investigate it;  5.5   Cr.P.C. itself has provisions for vitiation and non-vitiation of trial if there  is illegality committed by the magistrate. Section 460 of the Code enumerates  that if a magistrate does any of the acts specified in the said section, which he is                                                                                18   not empowered to, then his proceedings would not be set aside only on this  ground. Section 461 of the Code enumerates that if a magistrate does any of the  acts specified in the said section, which he is not empowered to, then his  proceedings would be void.        However, the illegalities under both these  provisions are by the magistrate and not by the investigating officer;  5.6   Section 462 of the Code provides that no finding, sentence or order of any  Criminal Court shall be set aside merely on the ground that the inquiry, trial or  other proceedings took place in a wrong sessions division, district, sub-division  or other local area, unless it appears that such error has in fact occasioned a  failure of justice. Section 463 of the Code provides that even if there is non-  compliance in recording the confession under Section 164 of the Code, even  then the same may be admissible if such non-compliance has not injured the  accused in his defence on the merits and that he duly made the statement  recorded, admit such statement. Section 465 of the Code provides that no  finding, sentence or order passed by a court of competent jurisdiction shall be  reversed or altered by a Court of Appeal on account of any error, omission or  irregularity in the complaint, summons, warrant, proclamation, order, judgment  or other proceedings before or during trial or in any enquiry or other  proceedings under this Code, or any error or irregularity in any sanction for the  prosecution, unless in the opinion of that Court, a failure of justice has in fact  been occasioned thereby.      Thus, under Section 465, irregularity in other                                                                                19   proceedings under the Code shall not lead to reversal of conviction unless it led  to failure of justice. Irregularity in investigation would not lead to acquittal  unless failure of justice is shown;  5.7   Further, illustration (e) to Section 114 of the Indian Evidence Act which  permits the Court to raise a presumption that official acts have been regularly  performed;  5.8   The decisions of this Court in the cases of Bhagwan Singh (supra);  Megha Singh (supra); Rajangam (supra) and Mohan Lal (supra) were, as such,  can be said to be on facts;  5.8.1 In the case of Bhagwan Singh (supra), the head constable who caught the  accused for smuggling of grains lodged an FIR under Section 161 IPC for  offering Rs.510/- as bribe to the head constable. The head constable himself  was the complainant and the IO. There were no independent witnesses in the  case. Even, this Court also commented that no effort was made by the IO to  have independent witnesses. That thereafter, it was held by this Court that the  complainant himself cannot be an investigator. Therefore, the said decision can  be said to be on the facts and circumstances of that case and cannot be said to be  an absolute general proposition of law that in any case the complainant cannot  be the investigator and in such a case the accused is entitled to acquittal.  5.8.2 In the case of Megha Singh (supra) also, no independent witnesses were  examined. Head constable who arrested the accused with a country made pistol                                                                                20   and cartridges lodged the complaint and he only proceeded with the  investigation. In the said case, it was found that there were discrepancies in  depositions of public witnesses"

SHAH, J.                            The short but interesting questions of law which fell for           consideration of this Court are, (i) as to whether is it permissible           in law for the appellant (employer) to withhold the payment of           gratuity            of   the   respondent   (employee),   even   after   his           superannuation from service, because of the pendency of the           disciplinary proceedings against him?, and (ii) where the           departmental enquiry had been instituted against an employee Signature Not Verified           while he was in service and continued after he attained the age of Digitally signed by JAYANT KUMAR ARORA Date: 2020.05.27 18:14:40 IST Reason:              superannuation, whether the punishment of dismissal can be                                                                                       1 imposed on being found guilty of misconduct in view of the  provisions made in Rule 34.2 of the CDA Rules of 1978?  2.      While considering the issues involved, the facts in nutshell  are required to be considered, which are as under:          The respondent herein (hereinafter referred to as the  “employee”) was posted as Chief General Manager (Production) at  Rajmahal area under Mahanadi Coalfields Limited, the appellant  herein (hereinafter referred to as the “employer”).           That the  employer Mahanadi Coalfield Limited has made the Conduct,  Discipline & Appeal Rules, 1978 (hereinafter referred to as the  “CDA Rules”).          That these Rules are applicable to all the  employees of the appellant company. Rule 27 of the CDA Rules  mentions the authorities who are empowered to impose various  punishments which are specified in column 3 of the schedule  attached to the CDA Rules. Rule 29 of the CDA Rules enlists the  procedure for imposing major penalties for misconduct and  misbehaviour. Rule 30 of the CDA Rules provides for action on  the Inquiry Report. Rule 34 of the CDA Rules, which is relevant  for our purpose, provides for special procedure in certain cases  and which permits continuance of disciplinary proceedings even  after    the   final   retirement   of   an   employee,   provided   the                                                                         2 disciplinary proceedings are instituted while the employee was in  service    whether        before   his    retirement              or    during     his     re­  employment.          It    further   provides              that        such     disciplinary  proceedings shall be continued and concluded by the authority  by which it was commenced in the same manner as if the  employee had continued in service.                         Rule 34.3 provides for  withholding the payment of gratuity during the pendency of the  disciplinary proceedings and it further permits for ordering the  recovery from gratuity of the whole or part of any pecuniary loss  caused      to   the        company,           if     have             been      guilty     of  offences/misconduct as mentioned in sub­section (6) of Section 4  of the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 or to have caused pecuniary  loss to the company by misconduct or negligence, during his  service. The relevant Rules of the CDA Rules shall be discussed  in detail hereinbelow.  2.1   While the respondent­employee was in service and posted as  Chief General Manager, he was served with the chargesheet  dated     1.10.2007.         There       was        very    serious           allegation    of  misconduct alleging dishonestly causing coal stock shortages  amounting to Rs.31.65 crores and thereby causing substantial  loss to the employer.         The employee was thereafter suspended                                                                                               3 from service on 09.02.2008 under Rule 24.1 of the CDA Rules,  pending departmental enquiry against him.       This suspension  however was revoked from 27.02.2009 without prejudice to the  departmental enquiry.    On completion of 60 years of age, the  respondent­employee     was   superannuated   with    effect   from  31.07.2010.      However, at the time of superannuation, the  departmental enquiry which was initiated against the employee  remained pending. Therefore, the appellant – employer withheld  the gratuity due and payable to the respondent­employee. The  respondent herein submitted an application dated 21.09.2010 to  the Director (Personnel) for payment of gratuity.    On the same  date, he also submitted an application before the Controlling  Authority under the Payment of Gratuity Act for payment of  gratuity.   Notice was issued to the appellant to appear.      The  appellant appeared and stated that the payment of gratuity was  withheld due to the reason that the disciplinary proceedings are  pending against him. The Controlling Authority held that in that  view of the matter, the claim of the respondent was pre­mature.       The respondent­employee challenged the order by filing the  writ petition.   The learned Single Judge dismissed the writ  petition holding that in view of the existence of an appellate                                                                    4 forum against the order passed by the Controlling Authority, the  respondent may file an appeal before the Appellate Authority.  However, instead of filing an appeal before the Appellate  Authority, the respondent­employee then filed Intra Court Writ  Appeal before the Division Bench of the High Court. The Division  Bench of the High Court has held that the writ petition was  maintainable. On merits and relying upon the decision of this  Court in the case of Jaswant Singh Gill v. Bharat Coking Coal  Ltd., reported in (2007) 1 SCC 663, the High Court ruled that the  disciplinary proceedings against the respondent were initiated  prior to the age of superannuation.    However, the respondent  retired from service on superannuation and hence the question of  imposing a major penalty of removal from service would not arise.  The Division Bench of the High Court has further held that the  power to withhold payment of gratuity as contained in Rule 34(3)  of the CDA Rules shall be subject to the provisions of the  Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. The Division Bench of the High  Court has further held that the statutory right accrued to the  respondent to get gratuity cannot be impaired by reason of the  Rules framed by the Coal India Limited which do not have the  force of a statute.   Consequently, direction is given to the                                                                  5 appellant­employer to release the amount of gratuity payable to  the respondent­employee. Hence, the present appeal.  3.    Shri Mahabir Singh, learned Senior Advocate appearing on  behalf of the appellant­employer has vehemently submitted that  in the facts and circumstances of the case and in view of the  specific provisions under the CDA Rules, namely, Rules 34.2 and  34.3 of the CDA Rules, the decision of this Court in the case of  Jaswant Singh Gill (supra) shall not be applicable.  3.1   It is further submitted by Shri Mahabir Singh, learned  Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the employer that Rule  34.2 of the CDA Rules authorises and/or permits the authority to  continue the disciplinary proceedings, if instituted while the  employee was in service, even after the final retirement of the  employee and such disciplinary proceedings shall be deemed to  be the proceedings and shall be continued and concluded by the  authority by which it was commenced in the same manner as if  the employee had continued in service.       It is submitted that  therefore even a major penalty of dismissal can be imposed on  conclusion of departmental proceedings even after the final  retirement of the employee, if the departmental proceedings are  instituted while the employee was in service. It is submitted that                                                                   6 the afore­stated Rule 34.2 of the CDA Rules has not been  properly appreciated and/or considered by this Court in the case  of Jaswant Singh Gill (supra).   It is submitted that in the said  decision, this Court has proceeded on the footing that after the  final retirement of the employee, a penalty of removal or  dismissal is not permissible. It is submitted that the aforesaid is  just contrary to Rule 34.2 of the CDA Rules.  3.2   It is further submitted by Shri Mahabir Singh, learned  Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the employer that even  otherwise Rule 34.3 authorises and/or permits the disciplinary  authority to withhold the payment of gratuity, or order the  recovery from gratuity of the whole or part of any pecuniary loss  caused to the company if such an employee has been guilty of  offences/misconduct as mentioned in sub­section (6) of Section 4  of the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 or to have caused pecuniary  loss to the company by misconduct or negligence, during his  service. It is submitted that Rule 34.3 of the CDA Rules is in  conformity and/or in consonance with sub­section (6) of Section  4 of the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 and there is no conflict  between the two.                                                                      7 3.3   Learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the  appellant has heavily relied upon the decision of this Court in the  case of State Bank of India v. Ram Lal Bhaskar, reported in (2011)  10 SCC 249.     It is submitted that while considering the pari  materia provisions under the State Bank of India Officers’ Service  Rules, 1992, namely, Rule 19(3), this Court has confirmed the  order of dismissal of an employee which was passed after his  retirement. It is submitted that in the said decision, this Court  distinguished another judgment of this Court in the case of UCO  Bank v. Rajinder Lal Capoor, reported in (2007) 6 SCC 694 on the  ground that in the said case the delinquent officer had already  been superannuated and the chargesheet was served upon him  after his retirement.   It is submitted that thereafter this Court  has further held that if the chargesheet is served before the  retirement, enquiry can continue even after the retirement as per  Rule 19(3) of the State Bank of India Officers’ Rules, 1992. It is  submitted that therefore this Court in the case of Ram Lal  Bhaskar (supra) specifically held that if the rules permit, enquiry  can continue even after the retirement of the employee.       It is  submitted that in the present case Rule 34.3 of the CDA Rules                                                                      8 permits the enquiry to continue even after the retirement of the  employee. It is submitted that the said decision is by a three  Judge Bench, however, decision in the case of Jaswant Singh Gill  (supra) is by a two Judge Bench.  3.4   It is further submitted by Shri Mahabir Singh, learned  Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the employer that  therefore when Rule 34 of the CDA Rules permits continuation of  the departmental enquiry even after the retirement of an  employee and such a retired employee is deemed to be in service  and on conclusion of the departmental enquiry initiated while the  employee was in service, penalty of dismissal is permissible, the  employer will get the right to forfeit the payment of gratuity of  such an employee as provided under Section 4(1) and 4(6) of the  Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 and even under Rule 34.3 of the  CDA Rules.  3.5   Making the above submissions and relying upon the  decision of this Court in the case of Ram Lal Bhaskar (supra) and  relying upon Rule 34.2 and 34.3 of the CDA Rules, it is prayed to  allow the present appeal and quash and set aside the impugned  judgment and order passed by the Division Bench of the High  Court.                                                                  9 4.    The present appeal is vehemently opposed by Shri Anukul  Chandra Pradhan, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf  of the respondent­employee. It is submitted by the learned Senior  Advocate that two issues are referred to be considered by a larger  Bench, namely, (1) Whether the Authority/Employer has power  to dismiss/terminate an employee (respondent herein) even after  retirement from service, if departmental disciplinary proceedings  are initiated during his employment/service; and (2) Whether the  employer is empowered with authority to withhold the payment of  gratuity during pendency of disciplinary proceedings.  4.1   It is vehemently submitted by the learned Senior Advocate  appearing on behalf of the employee that so far as issue No.1 is  concerned, Rule 27 provides the nature of penalties. Rule 27.1(i)  prescribes minor penalties, such as, withholding increment and  promotion including recovery of any pecuniary loss caused to the  company for misconduct, whereas the major penalties are  prescribed under Rule 27.1(iii), such as, reduction to a lower  grade, compulsory retirement, removal and dismissal from  service. It is submitted that on simple reading of Rule 27.1(iii), it  can be said un­mistakenly that the four major penalties can be  imposed so long as an employee remains in employment. It is                                                                     10 submitted that there was no order issued to the respondent with  regard to extension of his employment/service or re­employment  for certain period. It is submitted that Rule 34.2 provides only  the disciplinary proceedings will be deemed to be continued and  concluded as if he was in service. It is submitted that hence the  termination/dismissal cannot be passed after the retirement of  an employee. It is submitted that while there is no service/re­  employment, there arises no question of removal or dismissal  from service.  4.2   Now so far as issue no.2, namely, whether the employer is  empowered with authority to withhold the payment of gratuity  during pendency of disciplinary proceedings is concerned, it is  vehemently submitted by the learned Senior Advocate appearing  on behalf of the respondent that as per mandate of Section 4(1) of  the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972, gratuity becomes payable as  soon as the employee retires subject to the condition that the  employee shall have five years continuous service.  4.3   It is further submitted by the learned Senior Advocate  appearing on behalf of the employee that in terms of clauses (a)  or (b) of sub­section 6 of Section 4 of the Payment of Gratuity Act,  1972, the exercise of power to forfeit the gratuity amount of an                                                                    11 employee is available when the authority satisfies the pre­  condition that the service of the employee has already been  terminated for any act, omission or negligence causing any  damage or loss or destruction of property belong to an employer.  It is submitted that therefore “termination from service” is sine  qua non and basic requirement for invoking power under  Sections 4(6)(a) or 4(6)(b) of the Payment of Gratuity Act.  4.4   It is further submitted by the learned Senior Advocate  appearing on behalf of the employee that as per Section 4(1) of  the Payment of Gratuity Act, gratuity shall be payable to the  employee on the termination of his employment if he has  rendered continuous service for not less than five years.     It is  submitted that termination of employment may take place on (i)  on his superannuation; or (ii) on his retirement or resignation; or  (iii) on his death or disability due to accident or disease. It is  submitted that     in the present     case the respondent was  terminated by superannuation and therefore the respondent shall  be entitled to the amount of gratuity under Section 4(1) of the  Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972.  4.5   It is further submitted by the learned Senior Advocate  appearing on behalf of the employee that when there arises no                                                                   12 question for dismissal or removal from service after the employee  has retired on attaining the age of superannuation, the appellant  cannot withheld the amount of gratuity in exercise of powers  under Rule 34 of the CDA Rules being inconsistent           with the  Payment of Gratuity Act.  4.6   Learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the  employee has heavily relied upon the decision of this Court in the  case of Jaswant Singh Gill (Supra). It is vehemently submitted  that in the case of Jaswant Singh Gill (supra), this Court has  considered the very provisions of the CDA Rules and has  categorically observed and held that if an employee is permitted  to retire, thereafter a penalty of dismissal/removal from service  cannot be imposed, may be the departmental proceedings were  initiated prior to his retirement. It is submitted that therefore the  decision of this Court in the case of Jaswant Singh Gill (supra)  shall be applicable to the facts of the case on hand with full force.  4.7   Now so far as the reliance placed upon the decision of this  Court in the case of Ram Lal Bhaskar (supra), relied upon by the  learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant is  concerned, it is vehemently submitted by the learned Senior  Advocate appearing on behalf of the employee that the said                                                                    13 decision shall not be applicable to the facts of the case on hand  as in the said decision, this Court neither discussed nor  expressed as to whether the authority is empowered to dismiss or  remove the employee from service after retirement.           It is  submitted that in the said decision, this Court has only stated  that the employee shall be deemed to be in service only for the  purpose of continuation and conclusion of the disciplinary  proceedings if the memo of charges has been served before  retirement as provided under Rule 19(3) of the State Bank of  India Officers’ Service Rules, 1992. It is submitted that therefore  the said decision shall not be applicable to the facts of the case  on hand. It is however submitted that in the case of Jaswant  Singh Gill (supra), this Court has specifically held with reasons  that the major penalties like dismissal or removal from service  must be imposed so long as the employee remains in service,  even if the disciplinary proceedings were initiated prior to  attaining the age of superannuation.  4.8   It is further submitted by the learned Senior Advocate  appearing on behalf of the employee that even otherwise in view  of Section 14 of the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972, the provisions  of Gratuity Act shall override other enactments and therefore                                                                   14 Rule 34.2 and Rule 34.3 of the CDA Rules shall be un­  enforceable and ineffective in the eyes of law as the same shall be  inconsistent with the provisions of Payment of Gratuity Act, more  particularly Sections 4, 7, 13 and 14 of the Payment of Gratuity  Act.  4.9    It is further submitted by the learned Senior Advocate  appearing on behalf of the employee that the preamble of the  Payment of Gratuity Act clearly indicates the legislative intention  that the payment of gratuity is to provide socio­economic justice  and secure economic protection in the retired life when mental  and physical fitness is deteriorated due to ageing process. It is  submitted that Section 13 of the Payment of Gratuity Act gives  total immunity to gratuity from attachment which is payable at  the time of retirement. It is submitted therefore that the right to  gratuity is a statutory right which cannot be withheld under any  circumstances, other than those guidelines enumerated under  Section 4(6) of the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972.  4.10 Making the above submissions and heavily relied upon the  decision of this Court in the case of Jaswant Singh Gill (supra), it  is prayed to dismiss the present appeal and answer the reference  in favour of the respondent.                                                                   15 5.     We have heard the learned counsel appearing for the  respective parties at length.  5.1    The first question which is posed for the consideration of  this Court is, whether is it permissible in law for the appellant­  employer to withhold the payment of amount of gratuity payable  to the respondent­employee, even after his superannuation from  service, because of the pendency of the disciplinary proceedings  against him?      The second question which is posed for the  consideration of this Court is, where departmental enquiry had  been instituted against an employee while he was in service and  continued after he attained the age of superannuation, whether  the punishment of dismissal can be imposed on            being found  guilty of misconduct in view of the provisions made in Rule 34.2  of the CDA Rules?  5.2    It is not in dispute that a chargesheet came to be served  upon the respondent­employee much before he attained the age  of    superannuation,   i.e.,   on   1.10.2007.   That    while   the  disciplinary proceedings were pending, the respondent­employee  attained the age of superannuation on 31.07.2010. In view of the  pendency of the disciplinary proceedings, the appellant­employer  withheld the payment of gratuity. It is the case on behalf of the                                                                     16 respondent­employee that as the respondent employee was  permitted to retire and at the time when he attained the age of  superannuation, there was no order of termination on the basis  of the departmental enquiry or conviction in a criminal case and  therefore considering Section 4 of the Payment of Gratuity Act,  the respondent­employee shall be entitled to the amount of  gratuity. It is also the case on behalf of the respondent­employee  that even considering clause (b) of sub­section 6 of Section 4 of  the Payment of Gratuity Act, the gratuity payable to the  respondent­employee may be wholly or partially forfeited if the  services of such employee have been terminated for his riotous or  disorderly conduct or his services have been terminated for any  act which constitutes an offence involving moral turpitude,  provided that such offence is committed by him during the  course of his employment.     Relying upon the decision of this  Court in the case of Jaswant Singh Gill (supra), it is the case on  behalf of the respondent­employee that as held by this Court in  the said decision that once an employee is permitted to retire on  attaining the age of superannuation, no order of dismissal  subsequently can be passed though the disciplinary proceedings  are permitted to be continued under the CDA Rules and therefore                                                                  17 once the order of dismissal is not permissible, Section 4 of the  Payment of Gratuity Act shall be attracted and therefore the  respondent­employee shall be entitled to the amount of gratuity.  On the other hand, as observed hereinabove, it is the case on  behalf of the appellant­employer that Rule 34 permits the  management to withhold the gratuity during the pendency of the  disciplinary proceedings.    It is submitted that Rule 34.2 of the  CDA Rules permits the disciplinary proceedings, if instituted  while the employee was in service, after the final retirement of the  employee and such disciplinary proceedings shall be deemed to  be proceedings and shall be continued and concluded by the  authority by which it was commenced in the same manner as if  the employee had continued in service. It is submitted therefore  that   for   the   purpose   of   continuing   and   concluding   the  disciplinary proceedings, such an employee shall be deemed to be  in service and therefore even after the employee had attained the  age of superannuation, such an employee can be dismissed from  service, provided the disciplinary proceedings are instituted while  the employee was in service.  6.     While considering the issues involved in the present appeal,  the relevant provisions of the CDA Rules and Section 4 of the                                                                     18 Payment of Gratuity Act are required to be referred to and  considered, which are as under:      “34.2 Disciplinary proceeding, if instituted while the employee was in     service whether before his retirement or during his reemployment shall,     after the final retirement of the employee, be deemed to be proceeding     and shall be continued and concluded by the authority by which it was     commenced in the same manner as if the employee had continued in     service.      34.3 During the pendency of the disciplinary proceedings, the     Disciplinary Authority may withhold payment of gratuity, for ordering the     recovering from gratuity of the whole or part of any pecuniary loss     caused to the company if have been guilty of offences/ misconduct as     mentioned in Sub­section (6) of Section 4 of the payment of gratuity act,     1972 or to have caused pecuniary loss to the company by misconduct or     negligence, during his service including service rendered on deputation     or on re­employment after retirement. However, the provisions of Section     7(3) and 7(3A) of the Payment of Gratuity Act 1972 should be kept in     view in the event of delayed payment in the case the employee is fully     exonerated.”      Section 4 ­ Payment of gratuity      (1) Gratuity shall be payable to an employee on the termination of his     employment after he has rendered continuous service for not less than     five years,­­      (a) on his superannuation, or     (b) on his retirement or resignation, or     (c) on his death or disablement due to accident or disease:      Provided that the completion of continuous service of five years shall not     be necessary where the termination of the employment of any employee     is due to death or disablement:      Provided further that in the case of death of the employee, gratuity     payable to hi m shall be paid to his nominee or, if no nomination has     been made, to his heirs, and where any such nominees or heirs is a     minor, the share of such minor, shall be deposited with the controlling     authority who shall invest the same for the benefit of such minor in such     bank or other financial institution, as may be prescribed, until such     minor attains majority.      Explanation.­­For the purposes of this section, disablement means such     disablement as incapacitates an employee for the work which he was     capable of performing before the accident or disease resulting in such     disablement.      Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx                                                                                   19      (6) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub­section (1),­­      (a) the gratuity of an employee, whose services have been terminated for      any act, wilful omission or negligence causing any damage or loss to, or      destruction of, property belonging to the employer' shall be forfeited to      the extent of the damage or loss so caused;       (b) the gratuity payable to an employee may be wholly or partially      forfeited]—       (i) if the services of such employee have been terminated for his riotous      or disorderly conduct or any other act of violence on his part, or      (ii) if the services of such employee have been terminated for any act      which constitutes an offence involving moral turpitude, provided that      such offence is committed by him in the course of his employment.”  7.    Indisputably, the respondent was governed by the CDA  Rules. Therefore, Rules 34.2 and 34.3 of the CDA Rules shall be  applicable and the respondent­employee shall be governed by  the said provisions. Rule 34 permits the management to  withhold the gratuity during the pendency of the disciplinary  proceedings. Rule 34.2 permits the disciplinary proceedings to  be continued and concluded even after the employee has  attained the age of superannuation, provided the disciplinary  proceedings are instituted while the employee was in service. It  also further provides that such disciplinary proceedings shall be  deemed to be the proceedings and shall be continued and  concluded by the authority by which it was commenced in the  same manner as if the employee had continued in service.  Therefore, as such, on a fair reading of Rule 34.2 of the CDA  Rules, an employee shall be deemed to be continued in service,                                                                                    20 after he attains the age of superannuation/retired, for the  limited purpose of continuing and concluding the disciplinary  proceedings which were instituted while the employee was in  service.   Therefore, at the conclusion of such disciplinary  proceedings any of the penalty provided under Rule 27 of the  CDA Rules can be imposed by the authority including the order  of dismissal. If the submission on behalf of the employee that  after the employee has attained the age of superannuation  and/or he has retired from service, despite Rule 34.2, no order  of penalty of dismissal can be passed is accepted, in that case, it  will be frustrating permitting the authority to continue and  conclude the disciplinary proceedings after retirement.      If the  order of dismissal cannot be passed after the employee has  retired and/or has attained the age of superannuation in the  disciplinary   proceedings   which   were   instituted   while   the  employee was in service, in that case, there shall not be any  fruitful purpose to continue and conclude the disciplinary  proceedings in the same manner as if the employee had  continued in service.  8.   It is true that while considering the very provisions of the  CDA Rules, namely, Rule 34.2 and Rule 34.3 of the CDA Rules,                                                                    21 this Court in the case of Jaswant Singh Gill (supra) has observed  and held that once the employee is permitted to retire on  attaining the age of superannuation, thereafter no order of  dismissal can be passed.      However, for the reasons stated  hereinabove, we are not in agreement with the view taken by this  Court in the case of Jaswant Singh Gill (supra).     As observed  hereinabove, if no major penalty is permissible after retirement,  even in a case where the disciplinary proceedings were instituted  while the employee was in service, in that case, Rule 34.2 would  become otiose and shall be meaningless. On the contrary, there  is a decision of three Judge Bench of this Court in the case of  Ram Lal Bhaskar (supra) taking just a contrary view. In the case  of Ram Lal Bhaskar (supra), Rule 19(3) of the State Bank of India  Officers Service Rules, 1992 came up for consideration which  was pari materia with Rule 34.2 of the CDA Rules. The said Rule  19(3) of the State Bank of India Officers Service Rules, 1992 also  permits the disciplinary proceedings to continue even after the  retirement of an employee if those were instituted when the  delinquent employee was in service. In that case, chargesheet  was served upon the respondent before his retirement.         The  proceedings continued after his retirement and were conducted                  "

Challenging the order of transfer, the respondent moved                           the Central Administrative Tribunal 1 in OA No 627 of 2019. By an order                           dated 17 September 2019, the CAT granted an ad interim stay of the order                           of transfer. Eventually, after the OA was heard, it was dismissed by the                           CAT by an order dated 5 November 2019. Aggrieved by the order of the                           CAT, the respondent moved the High Court of Judicature at Bombay. On  Signature Not Verified   11 November 2019, at the production stage, the High Court continued the Digitally signed by SANJAY KUMAR Date: 2020.02.10 18:04:56 IST Reason:                          ad interim order. By the impugned judgment and order of the High Court         1“CAT”                                             2          dated 2 December 2019, the Writ Petition 2 under Article 226 of the          Constitution was admitted and by way of an interim order, the ad interim          direction granted on 11 November 2019 was continued. The Union of          India is in appeal.           3    The services of the respondent are transferable.         The order of          transfer was issued by the Government of India in the Ministry of Finance          (Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs) on 5 September 2019. By          the order, five officials were transferred from their respective places of          posting. The respondent has, however, chosen to contest the order of          transfer and as a result of the ad interim order of the CAT and the interim          order of the High Court has not joined at the place of posting. In the          meantime, the respondent has been suspended.           4    The High Court, in interfering with the order of transfer, has relied on          two circumstances. Firstly, the High Court has noted that as a result of the          stay on the order of transfer, the headquarters of the respondent will          remain at Mumbai and even if he is to be suspended, his headquarters will          continue to remain at Mumbai. The second reason, which has weighed          with the High Court, is that the spouse of the respondent suffers from a          cardiac ailment and is obtaining medical treatment in Mumbai. In our view,          neither of these reasons can furnish a valid justification for the High Court          to take recourse to its extraordinary jurisdiction under Article 226 of the          Constitution in passing an order of injunction of this nature. Significantly,          the High Court has not even found a prima facie case to the effect that the          order of transfer was either mala fide or in breach of law. The High Court 2Writ Petition No 11669 of 2019                                      3  could not have dictated to the employer as to where the respondent should  be posted during the period of suspension.          Individual hardships are  matters for the Union of India, as an employer, to take a dispassionate  view. However, we are categorically of the view that the impugned order of  the High Court interfering with the order of transfer was in excess of  jurisdiction and an improper exercise of judicial power. We are constrained  to observe that the impugned order has been passed in breach of the  settled principles and precedents which have consistently been enunciated  and followed by this Court. The manner in which judicial power has been  exercised by the High Court to stall a lawful order of transfer is disquieting.  We express our disapproval.   5    Mr Manan Kumar Mishra, learned Senior Counsel urged that during  the course of an earlier hearing, the Union government expressed its  readiness to post the respondent at three alternative places instead of  Bhubaneswhar and hence the order of transfer may be modified. We  decline to allow this jurisdiction to be utilized in terrorem to compel the  Union government to post the respondent to a place which he may be  prefer. There is no lawful reason for the respondent to cling on to a posting  at Mumbai. He cannot claim a posting as of right to a place of his choice.   6    We accordingly allow the appeal and set aside the interim order of the  High Court dated 2 December 2019 staying the transfer. The interim order  passed by the High Court shall accordingly stand vacated. Conditional on  the respondent reporting at Bhubaneshwar within a period of one week  from today, he will be at liberty to make a representation to the Union of                                          4        India in regard to his transfer. We make it clear that we are not making        any observations in this regard.         7    There shall be no order as to costs.                                                  …………...…...….......………………........J.

The State is aggrieved against an order passed by the High Court          of Madhya Pradesh on 2nd May, 2016 whereby the proceedings          against the respondents, both sons of late Manohar Singh Jadon,          for an offence under Sections 420, 120-B of the Indian Penal Code,          18601 were quashed.   2.      A charge sheet for the offences under Sections 420, 406, 409,          120B IPC and 13(1)(d) and 13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption          Act, 19882 was filed on 9th July, 2008 consequent to registration of          FIR No. 3 of 2007 on 23 rd June, 2007.     The allegation was that          Manohar Singh Jadon, deceased father of the respondents in          connivance with other employees of District Cooperative Kendriya          Bank Maryadit, Shajapur3 committed financial irregularities on the 1    for short, ‘IPC’ 2    for short, ‘Act’ 3    for short, ‘Bank’                                                                            1 basis of forged documents by misusing his post and by providing  fake loan to the relatives. Manohar Singh Jadon was President of  the Bank from 5th February, 1997 to 26th March, 2002 and from 27 th  March, 2002 to 7th May, 2004.         Harshvardhan Singh Jadon  (accused-respondent No. 2) is the proprietor of M/s. Harshvardhan  & Brothers whereas Yogendra Singh (accused-respondent No. 1) is  the proprietor of M/s. Sarohar Trading Company.        Ghanshyam  Sharma, General Manager, Ramanlal Acharya, Manager, Ram Singh  Yadav, General Manager were also arrayed as accused.        It was  alleged that accused Harshvardhan Singh Jadon submitted an  application on 2nd November, 2000 for grant of cash credit limit of  Rs.25 lakhs and that the cash credit limit was sanctioned without  following the due procedure.   It was also alleged that mortgage  deed was not registered nor signature of original loanee was found  on the mortgage paper. It is also pointed out that an amount of  Rs.59,88,327/- was balance on 1st December, 2001 even after  depositing Rs.25 lakhs and that the President has done the renewal  of cash credit limit at his own level and its confirmation was got  done later on from the loan Sub-Committee, while the case was of  the son of the President alone. In respect of Yogendra Singh, again  the allegation is that cash credit limit of Rs.25 lakhs was  sanctioned on the basis of his application dated 30 th July, 2001  without completing any of the procedural requirements and  without mortgage of any of the property.        Smt. Saroj Singh  mortgaged the land but without any valuation.       The surety of                                                                      2      Ishwar Singh was taken. The same person mortgaged land as in       the case of Harshvardhan.       Similar is the assertion in respect of       registration of mortgage.       It was also alleged that a sum of       Rs.25,65,894/- is the balance as on 31st March, 2002 even after       withdrawal beyond the approved credit limit of Rs.25 lakhs.   3.   The Special Judge passed an order of framing of charges against       Harshvardhan Singh Jadon and Yogendra Singh Jadon apart from       other accused on 24th February, 2014. Such order was challenged       by the respondents by way of a criminal revision.  4.   The High Court in the Revision Petition found that the offences       under Sections 420 and 120-B IPC are not made out against the       respondents.   The Court held that there is no assertion that the       cash credit facility obtained with a knowledge that they will not       repay the loan amount. The Court held as under:                “12. It may be that the Officers of the Bank, because of               the fact that father of the applicants was President of               the Bank, had acted in disregard of the relevant rules               and regulations in that behalf of confer benefit upon the               applicants, but that will give rise to liability against the               officers of the bank who failed to discharge their duties               in accordance with prescribed norms and regulations.               However, that may not be a ground to proceed against               a person who has been granted cash credit facility.                          xx             xx                    xx                14. In the instant case, the uncontroverted allegations               taken in their entirety do not prima facie establish that               the applicants deceived the Bank Authorities or               fraudulently or dishonestly induced them to sanction               cash credit facility.    Thus, the basic ingredient to               constitute the offence of 420 of IPC is totally missing in               the chargesheet.”                                                                                  3 5.   We find that the High Court has examined the entire issue as to       whether the offence under Sections 420 and 120-B is made out or       not at pre trial stage. The respondents are beneficiary of the grant       of cash credit limit when their father was the President of the Bank.       The power under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,       1973 cannot be exercised where the allegations are required to be       proved in court of law. The manner in which loan was advanced       without any proper documents and the fact that the respondents       are beneficiary of benevolence of their father prima facie disclose       an offence under Sections 420 and 120-B IPC.           It may be stated       that other officials of the Bank have been charge sheeted for an       offence under Sections 13(1)(d) and 13(2) of the Act. The charge       under Section 420 IPC is not an isolated offence but it has to be       read along with the offences under the Act to which the       respondents may be liable with the aid of Section 120-B of IPC.   6.   Consequently, we find that the order of the High Court quashing       the charges against the respondents is not sustainable in law and       the same is set aside. The appeal is allowed. It shall be open to       the respondents to take such other action as may be available to       them in accordance with law.                                       .............................................J.

ABDUL NAZEER, J.              1.             Leave granted.            2.             This appeal is directed against the order dated 13.02.2019            passed by the High Court of Madhya Pradesh at Jabalpur in Writ            Petition No. 2778 of 2019. By the impugned order, the High Court            has dismissed the writ petition and has upheld the validity of the Signature Not Verified             order dated 09.01.2019 passed by respondent no.1, namely Food Digitally signed by Anita Malhotra Date: 2020.11.16 19:04:05 IST Reason:             Corporation of India (for short ‘the Corporation’) through its                                                      1 Deputy General Manager (Personnel), who is respondent no. 2  herein, to terminate a contract of service with the appellant and  to blacklist the appellant from participating in any future tenders  of the Corporation for a period of 5 years.  3.    The Corporation had issued a Bid Document on 25.11.2016  inviting bids for appointment of a recruitment agency to conduct  the   process   of   recruitment   for   hiring   watchmen      for   the  Corporation’s   office.   The   appellant     submitted   its   bid   on  21.12.2016 and was eventually declared as the successful bidder  vide the Corporation’s letter dated 28.03.2017. After completion  of the formalities, the appellant was appointed for a period of 2  years w.e.f. 14.02.2017 for undertaking the tendered work of  conducting recruitment of watchmen for the Corporation.  4.    As part of its work, on 01.04.2018, the appellant conducted a  written exam for eligible aspirants for the post of watchman with  the Corporation at various centres in Madhya Pradesh. On the  same day, a Special Task Force of Bhopal Police arrested 50  persons in Gwalior, who were in possession of certain handwritten  documents which prima facie appeared to be the question papers  related to the examination conducted by the appellant. The police                                     2 filed a charge sheet on 03.08.2018 against certain persons  including an employee of the appellant. Upon receipt of the above  information, the Corporation issued a show cause notice dated  10.04.2018 to the appellant informing the appellant about the  said arrest and seizure of documents which appeared to contain  question papers related to the examination conducted by the  appellant. This notice alleged that the appellant had breached  various clauses of the Bid Document dated 25.11.2016 on the  ground that it was the sole responsibility of the appellant to  prepare and distribute the question papers as well as conduct the  examination in a highly confidential manner. Several clauses of  the Bid Document were listed in the said notice dated 10.04.2018  and the Corporation alleged that the appellant had violated the  same due to its abject failure and clear negligence in ensuring  smooth conduct of the examination. The said notice directed the  appellant to furnish an explanation within 15 days, failing which  an   appropriate   ex-parte decision would be taken by the  Corporation.  5.   The appellant replied to the aforesaid notice vide its letter  dated 12.04.2018 denying any negligence or leak of question                                  3 papers from its end. In its communication, the appellant furnished  several factual justifications in support of its position and also  requested the Corporation to make the documents seized by the  police available to the appellant for forensic analysis. These  documents were provided to the appellant vide the Corporation’s  letter dated 18.10.2018. The Corporation addressed another letter  dated 22.10.2018 calling upon the appellant to submit its final  reply/explanation.   Thereafter,   on   27.10.2018,   the   appellant  submitted an Observation Report-cum-Reply/Explanation which  compared the seized documents with the original question papers  and contended that there were many dissimilarities between the  two and thus there had been no leakage or dissemination of the  original question papers.  6.   By its aforesaid order dated 09.01.2019, the Corporation  concluded that the shortcomings/negligence on part of the  appellant stood established beyond any reasonable doubt and  proceeded to terminate its contract with the appellant and also  blacklisted the appellant from participating in any future tenders  of the corporation for a period of 5 years. Further, the appellant’s  security deposit with the Corporation was forfeited and the                                     4 appellant was directed to execute the unexpired portion of the  contract at its own cost and risk.  7.   Aggrieved by the above order of the Corporation, the  appellant, after issuing a legal notice, filed Writ Petition No. 2778  of 2019 before the High Court. This petition came to be dismissed  by the High Court’s aforesaid order dated 13.02.2019 which is  under challenge before us.  8.   At the outset, it may be noted that Shri Gourab Banerji,  learned senior counsel for the appellant, has submitted that the  appellant only seeks to contest the issue of blacklisting and not  the termination of the contract between the appellant and the  Corporation. Thus, the sole issue that falls for determination  before us is whether the Corporation was entitled to and justified  in blacklisting the appellant for 5 years from participating in its  future tenders.  9.   Before delving into the contentions of the parties, it would be  useful to extract some of the provisions of the Corporation’s Bid  Document      dated   25.11.2016      which       would   be   material   to  determining    the    validity   of       the   blacklisting   order   dated  09.01.2019:                                        5               “INSTRUCTIONS TO BIDDERS          XXX                  XXX               XXX  10. DISQUALIFICATION CONDITIONS: Bidder who have been blacklisted or otherwise debarred by FCI or central/state Govt. or any central/ State PSU / Statutory Corporations, will be ineligible during the period of such blacklisting.  10.1      Any Bidder whose contract with FCI or central/state Govt. or any central/State PSU/Statutory Corporations has been terminated before the expiry of the contract period for breach of any terms and conditions at any point of time during the last five years, shall be ineligible.  10.2     Bidder whose Earnest Money Deposit and/or Security Deposit have been forfeited by the FCI or central/state Govt. or any central/State PSU/Statutory Corporations, during the last five years, for breach of any terms and conditions, shall be ineligible.    XXX                XXX                XXX  25. CORRUPT PRACTICES: … 25.4 Any corrupt practice indulged by the agency or any of its employee at any of the stages of the recruitment including preparation of the question paper, distribution of question paper, conducting of the exams, valuation of the answer sheets, declaration of results etc. shall lead to immediate cancellation of the contact and the agency shall be liable for appropriate legal action without prejudice to any other clause in the contract.          XXX                  XXX               XXX  42. TERMINATION OF CONTRACT: 42.1 By Corporation … (ii) The FCI shall also have, without prejudice to other rights and remedies, the right in the event of breach by the Bidder of any of the terms and conditions of the contract, or failing to observe any of the provisions,                               6         obligations governing the contract, to terminate the         contract forthwith and to get the work done for the         unexpired period of the contract at the risk and cost of         the Agency and to forfeit the Security Deposit or any part         thereof for recovery of all losses, damages, costs and         expenses which may be incurred by FCI consequent to         such termination and / or in completing the assignment.         FCI may also effect recovery from other sums then due to         the Agency or which at any time thereafter may become         due under this or any other contract with FCI. In case the         sum is not sufficient to cover the full amounts         recoverable, the Agency shall pay FCI on demand the         entire remaining balance due.          (iii) FCI may at any time without assigning any reason         terminate the contract without any liability by giving 7         working days’ notice to the bidder.”   10. On behalf of the appellant, it was submitted by Shri Banerji  that the Corporation had no power under the above quoted or any  other provisions of the Bid Document dated 25.11.2016 to  blacklist the appellant. It was argued that above quoted Clause 10  titled “Disqualifications Conditions”, which has been relied upon  by the Corporation, merely lays down eligibility criteria and does  not grant any power of future blacklisting. It was further alleged  that the said clause was also not mentioned in the show cause  notice dated 10.04.2018 issued by the Corporation. The said show  cause notice was also impinged upon by the appellant by  submitting that it failed to meet the requirements of natural  justice as it neither mentioned the grounds necessitating action                                      7 nor specified what actions were proposed to be taken. Thus, Shri  Banerji submitted that in the absence of a valid show cause  notice, the consequent blacklisting order cannot be sustained. He  further highlighted the outsized impact of the Corporation’s  impugned order on the appellant in as much as the Corporation’s  branches     in    other      States   as     well   as   other   government  corporations have now issued as many as 5 notices to the  appellant to cancel contracts or prevent the appellant from  participating in their tender process and have also forfeited or  withheld outstanding payments and security deposits. He argued  that due to the domino effect of the Corporation’s blacklisting of  the   appellant,       the   appellant       has   unreasonably    suffered   5  punishments       at    the    hands     of    the   Corporation    which     is  disproportionate and tantamounts to the civil death of the  appellant.   11. On the other hand, Shri Ajit Pudussery, the learned counsel  appearing on behalf of the Corporation argued that due to the  negligence of the appellant, the entire recruitment process had to  be scrapped and the same has deprived several applicants of  employment and undermined the confidence of the public in the                                          8 recruitment process of the Corporation. In relation to the issue of  blacklisting, he submitted that since the appellant had breached  the terms of the contract by leaking the question papers for the  examination, it was not in public interest to permit it to  participate in future tenders. He further submitted that the  appellant must have been aware of the possibility of the  punishment of blacklisting as the same was provided for in the  Bid Document. Thus, it was argued that since the blacklisting  order was made as per the Bid Document and after issuance of a  show cause notice, to which the appellant was granted ample  time to reply to, the Corporation’s impugned blacklisting order  dated 09.01.2019 cannot be challenged.  12. We have given our anxious consideration to the submissions  made by the learned counsel at the Bar on behalf of the parties.  In our opinion, the validity of the impugned order of the  Corporation dated 09.01.2019, so far as the blacklisting of the  appellant thereunder is concerned, would in turn be determined  by the validity of the underlying show cause notice dated  10.04.2018 issued by the Corporation to the appellant.                                     9 13. At the outset, it must be noted that it is the first principle of  civilised jurisprudence that a person against whom any action is  sought to be taken or whose right or interests are being affected  should be given a reasonable opportunity to defend himself. The  basic principle of natural justice is that before adjudication starts,  the authority concerned should give to the affected party a notice  of the case against him so that he can defend himself. Such notice  should be adequate and the grounds necessitating action and the  penalty/action proposed should be mentioned specifically and  unambiguously. An order travelling beyond the bounds of notice is  impermissible and without jurisdiction to that extent. This Court  in Nasir Ahmad v. Assistant Custodian General, Evacuee  Property, Lucknow and Anr.,1 has held that it is essential for  the notice to specify the particular grounds on the basis of which  an action is proposed to be taken so as to enable the noticee to  answer the case against him. If these conditions are not satisfied,  the person cannot be said to have been granted any reasonable  opportunity of being heard.     1   (1980) 3 SCC 1.                                   10 14. Specifically, in the context of blacklisting of a person or an  entity by the state or a state corporation, the requirement of a  valid, particularized and unambiguous show cause notice is  particularly crucial due to the severe consequences of blacklisting  and the stigmatization that accrues to the person/entity being  blacklisted. Here, it may be gainful to describe the concept of  blacklisting and the graveness of the consequences occasioned  by it. Blacklisting has the effect of denying a person or an entity  the privileged opportunity of entering into government contracts.  This privilege arises because it is the State who is the  counterparty in government contracts and as such, every eligible  person is to be afforded an equal opportunity to participate in  such contracts, without arbitrariness and discrimination. Not only  does blacklisting takes away this privilege, it also tarnishes the  blacklisted person’s reputation and brings the person’s character  into question. Blacklisting also has long-lasting civil consequences  for the future business prospects of the blacklisted person.  15. In the present case as well, the appellant has submitted that  serious prejudice has been caused to it due to the Corporation’s  order of blacklisting as several other government corporations                                   11 have now terminated their contracts with the appellant and/or  prevented the appellant from participating in future tenders even  though the impugned blacklisting order was, in fact, limited to the  Corporation’s Madhya Pradesh regional office. This domino effect,  which can effectively lead to the civil death of a person, shows  that the consequences of blacklisting travel far beyond the  dealings of the blacklisted person with one particular government  corporation and in view thereof, this Court has consistently  prescribed strict adherence to principles of natural justice  whenever an entity is sought to be blacklisted.  16. The severity of the effects of blacklisting and the resultant  need for strict observance of the principles of natural justice  before passing an order of blacklisting were highlighted by this  Court in Erusian Equipment & Chemicals Ltd. v. State of  West Bengal2 in the following terms:            “12. … The order of blacklisting has the effect of depriving            a person of equality of opportunity in the matter of public            contract. A person who is on the approved list is unable to            enter into advantageous relations with the Government            because of the order of blacklisting. A person who has            been dealing with the Government in the matter of sale            and purchase of materials has a legitimate interest or            expectation. When the State acts to the prejudice of a            person it has to be supported by legality.                     XXX                  XXX               XXX 2   (1975) 1 SCC 70.                                        12            15. … The blacklisting order involves civil consequences.            It casts a slur. It creates a barrier between the persons            blacklisted and the Government in the matter of            transactions. The black lists are instruments of coercion.                     XXX                   XXX                XXX             20. Blacklisting has the effect of preventing a person from            the privilege and advantage of entering into lawful            relationship with the Government for purposes of gains.            The fact that a disability is created by the order of            blacklisting indicates that the relevant authority is to have            an objective satisfaction. Fundamentals of fair play            require that the person concerned should be given an            opportunity to represent his case before he is put on the            blacklist.”  17. Similarly, this Court in Raghunath Thakur v. State of  Bihar,3 struck down an order of blacklisting for future contracts  on the ground of non-observance of the principles of natural  justice. The relevant extract of the judgement in that case is as  follows:            “4. … [I]t is an implied principle of the rule of law that            any order having civil consequences should be passed            only after following the principles of natural justice. It has            to be realised that blacklisting any person in respect of            business ventures has civil consequence for the future            business of the person concerned in any event. Even if            the rules do not express so, it is an elementary principle            of natural justice that parties affected by any order should            have right of being heard and making representations            against the order.”  18. This Court in Gorkha Security Services v. Government  (NCT of Delhi) and Ors.4 has described blacklisting as being  3   (1989) 1 SCC 229. 4   (2014) 9 SCC 105.                                         13 equivalent to the civil death of a person because blacklisting is  stigmatic in nature and debars a person from participating in  government tenders thereby precluding him from the award of  government contracts. It has been held thus:          “16. It is a common case of the parties that the         blacklisting has to be preceded by a show-cause notice.         Law in this regard is firmly grounded and does not even         demand much amplification. The necessity of compliance         with the principles of natural justice by giving the         opportunity to the person against whom action of         blacklisting is sought to be taken has a valid and solid         rationale behind it. With blacklisting, many civil and/or         evil consequences follow. It is described as “civil death” of         a person who is foisted with the order of blacklisting. Such         an order is stigmatic in nature and debars such a person         from participating in government tenders which means         precluding him from the award of government contracts.”    19. In light of the above decisions, it is clear that a prior show  cause notice granting a reasonable opportunity of being heard is  an essential element of all administrative decision-making and  particularly so in decisions pertaining to blacklisting which entail  grave consequences for the entity being blacklisted. In these  cases, furnishing of a valid show cause notice is critical and a  failure to do so would be fatal to any order of blacklisting  pursuant thereto.                                        14 20. In the present case, the factum of service of the show cause  notice dated 10.04.2018 by the Corporation upon the appellant is  not in dispute. Rather, what Shri Banerji has argued on behalf of  the appellant is that the contents of the said show cause notice  were not such that the appellant could have anticipated that an  order of blacklisting was being contemplated by the Corporation.  Gorkha Security Services (supra) is a case where this Court  had to decide whether the action of blacklisting could have been  taken without specifically proposing/contemplating such an action  in the show-cause notice. For this purpose, this Court laid down  the below guidelines as to the contents of a show cause notice  pursuant to which adverse action such as blacklisting may be  adopted:        “Contents of the show-cause notice        21. The central issue, however, pertains to the        requirement of stating the action which is proposed to be        taken. The fundamental purpose behind the serving of        show-cause notice is to make the noticee understand the        precise case set up against him which he has to meet.        This would require the statement of imputations detailing        out the alleged breaches and defaults he has committed,        so that he gets an opportunity to rebut the same. Another        requirement, according to us, is the nature of action which        is proposed to be taken for such a breach. That should        also be stated so that the noticee is able to point out that        proposed action is not warranted in the given case, even        if the defaults/breaches complained of are not        satisfactorily explained. When it comes to blacklisting,        this requirement becomes all the more imperative, having        regard to the fact that it is harshest possible action.                                     15         22. The High Court has simply stated that the purpose of         show-cause notice is primarily to enable the noticee to         meet the grounds on which the action is proposed against         him. No doubt, the High Court is justified to this agent,         However, it is equally important to mention as to what         would be the consequence if the noticee does not         satisfactorily meet the grounds on which an action is         proposed. To put it otherwise, we are of the opinion that in         order fulfil the requirements of principles of natural         justice, a show-cause notice should meet the following         two requirements viz:          (i) The material/grounds to be stated which according to         the department necessitates an action;         (ii) Particular penalty/action which is proposed to be         taken. It is this second requirement which the High Court         has failed to omit.            We may hasten to add that even if it is not specifically         mentioned in the show-cause notice but it can clearly and         safely be discerned from the reading thereof, that would         be sufficient to meet this requirement.”  21. Thus, from the above discussion, a clear legal position  emerges that for a show cause notice to constitute the valid basis  of a blacklisting order, such notice must spell out clearly, or its  contents be such that it can be clearly inferred therefrom, that  there is intention on the part of the issuer of the notice to blacklist  the noticee. Such a clear notice is essential for ensuring that the  person against whom the penalty of blacklisting is intended to be  imposed, has an adequate, informed and meaningful opportunity  to show cause against his possible blacklisting.                                      16 22. To test whether the above stipulations as to the contents of  the show cause have been satisfied in the present case, it may be  useful to extract the relevant portion of the said show cause  notice dated 10.04.2018 wherein the Corporation specified the  actions that it might adopt against the appellant:          “Whereas, the above cited clauses are only indicative &         not exhaustive.          Whereas, it is quite evident from the sequence of events         that M/s U.MC Technologies Pvt. Ltd, Kolkata has violated         the condition/clauses governing the contract due to its         abject failure & clear negligence in ensuring smooth         conduct of examination. As it was the sole responsibility         of the agency to keep the process of preparation &         distribution of question paper and conducting of exam in         highly confidential manner, the apparent leak point         towards, acts of omission & commission on the part of M/S         UMC Technologies Ltd. Kolkata.          Whereas, M/S UMC Technologies Pvt. Ltd. Kolkata is         hereby provided an opportunity to explain its Position in         the matter before suitable decision is taken as per T&C of         MTF. The explanation if any should reach this office within         a period of 15 days of receipt of this notice falling which         appropriate decision shall be taken. ex-parte as per terms         and conditions mentioned in MTF without prejudice to any         other legal rights & remedies available with the         corporation.”  23. It is also necessary to highlight the order dated 09.01.2019  passed by the Corporation in pursuant to the aforesaid notice, the  operative portion of which reads as under:            “After having examined the entire matter in detail, the           shortcomings/negligence on the part of M/s UMC           Technologies Pvt. Ltd. stands established beyond any                                      17              reasonable doubt. Now, therefore in accordance with              clause 42.1(II) of the governing MTF, the competent              authority hereby terminates the contract at the risk and              cost of the Agency. As per Clause No. 10.1 & 10.2              the said M/s UMC Technologies Pvt. Ltd. is hereby              debarred from participating in any future tenders              of the corporation for a period of Five years.              Further, the Security Deposit too stands forfeited as per              clause 15.6 of MTF.        This order is issued without              prejudice to any other legal remedy available with FCI              to safeguard its interest.”    24. A plain reading of the notice makes it clear that the action of  blacklisting was neither expressly proposed nor could it have  been inferred from the language employed by the Corporation in  its show cause notice. After listing 12 clauses of the “Instruction  to Bidders”, which were part of the Corporation’s Bid Document  dated 25.11.2016, the notice merely contains a vague statement  that in light of the alleged leakage of question papers by the  appellant,     an   appropriate      decision    will   be   taken       by   the  Corporation. In fact, Clause 10 of the same Instruction to Bidders  section of the Bid Document, which the Corporation has argued to  be the source of its power to blacklist the appellant, is not even  mentioned in the show cause notice. While the notice clarified  that the 12 clauses specified in the notice were only indicative  and not exhaustive, there was nothing in the notice which could                                         18 have given the appellant the impression that the action of  blacklisting was being proposed. This is especially true since the  appellant was under the belief that the Corporation was not even  empowered to take such an action against it and since the only  clause which mentioned blacklisting was not referred to by the  Corporation in its show cause notice. While the following  paragraphs deal with whether or not the appellant’s said belief  was well-founded, there can be no question that it was incumbent  on the part of the Corporation to clarify in the show cause notice  that it intended to blacklist the appellant, so as to provide  adequate and meaningful opportunity to the appellant to show  cause against the same.  25. The mere existence of a clause in the Bid Document, which  mentions blacklisting as a bar against eligibility, cannot satisfy  the mandatory requirement of a clear mention of the proposed  action in the show cause notice. The Corporation’s notice is  completely silent about blacklisting and as such, it could not have  led the appellant to infer that such an action could be taken by  the Corporation in pursuance of this notice. Had the Corporation  expressed its mind in the show cause notice to black list, the                                  19 appellant could have filed a suitable reply for the same.  Therefore, we are of the opinion that the show cause notice dated  10.04.2018 does not fulfil the requirements of a valid show cause  notice for blacklisting. In our view, the order of blacklisting the  appellant clearly traversed beyond the bounds of the show cause  notice which is impermissible in law. As a result, the consequent  blacklisting order dated 09.01.2019 cannot be sustained.  26. In view of our conclusion that the blacklisting order dated  09.01.2019 passed by the Corporation is contrary to the principles  of natural justice, it is unnecessary for us to consider the other  contentions of the learned counsel for the appellant.       Having  regard to the peculiar facts and circumstances of the present  case, we deem it appropriate not to remit the matter to the  Corporation for fresh consideration.  27. For the foregoing reasons, the appeal succeeds and it is  accordingly allowed. The order dated 13.02.2019 passed by the  High Court is set aside. The Corporation’s order dated 09.01.2019  is hereby quashed only so far as it blacklists the appellant from  participating in future tenders. The parties will bear their own  costs.                                  20 28.

CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 272 OF 2020        Feeling   aggrieved    and    dissatisfied    with   the   impugned  judgment and order dated 20.04.2018 passed by the High Court of  Delhi in Crl. L.P. No.259 of 2018 by which the High Court has  dismissed the said application for leave to appeal challenging the  judgment and order of acquittal passed by the Learned Trial Court  acquitting the original accused ­ respondents herein for the offence  under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act (for short, ‘the  N.I. Act’) and thereby confirming the judgment and order of  acquittal   passed   by    the   Learned   Trial   Court,   the   original  complainant has preferred the present appeal.                                    3     CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 271 OF 2020   2.   According to the complainant, the appellant is in the business  of sale and purchase of Foreign Exchange.            That the original  accused ­ respondents herein approached the appellant for  issuance of Foreign Exchange Currency/USD Travel Currency  Card. According to the original complainant ­ appellant herein, a  total sum of Rs.19,01,320/­ was paid to the accused through VTM  (Visa Travel Money Card) which came to be withdrawn by the  accused   on   different   days   on   10.01.2014,   20.02.2014   and  22.02.2014. According to the complainant, the original accused ­  respondents herein paid Rs.6,45,807/­ only leaving a balance of  Rs.12,55,513/­.   According to the complainant, the respondents  accused issued four cheques total amounting Rs.9,55,574/­, which  were issued in favour of the complainant.            However, all the  aforesaid cheques when presented, came to be dishonoured.  According to the complainant thereafter the respondents issued one                                     4   another cheque bearing No.374941 of Rs.9,55,574/­ of the  partnership firm namely Shakti International in discharge of the  legal liability. According to the complainant when the same cheque  was presented the same came to be dishonoured due to “STOP  PAYMENT” vide bank memo dated 02.06.2014.               Thereafter, the  complainant sent a legal notice upon the original accused under  Section 138 of the N.I. Act vide notice dated 07.06.2014. Despite  the service of the notice, the accused did not make the payment of  the cheque amount. Therefore, the original complainant ­ appellant  herein   filed   the   complaint   before   the   Learned   Metropolitan  Magistrate. The Learned Metropolitan Magistrate also believed that  the cheque was issued and the same was returned unpaid with  remarks “STOP PAYMENT”. The Learned Metropolitan Magistrate  believed that the accused Sushil Kumar Sharma admitted his  signature on the cheque. The Learned Metropolitan Magistrate also  believed receipt of the demand notice by the accused persons and  non­payment towards the said cheque.               However, thereafter  Learned Metropolitan Magistrate observed and held that there is no  legal liability as the payment through the card is not established                                   5   and proved; that the payments are prior to the issuance of the card.  Resultantly, the Learned Metropolitan Magistrate dismissed the  complaint by judgment and order dated 20.01.2017.           Feeling  aggrieved and dissatisfied with the judgment and order of acquittal  passed by the Learned Trial Court acquitting the accused, the  complainant preferred appeal before the Learned Sessions Court.  Learned Sessions Court dismissed the said appeal on the ground  that the same is not maintainable. Thereafter the complainant filed  the appeal before the High Court. By the impugned judgment and  order, the High Court dismissed the appeal and confirmed the order  of acquittal passed by the Learned Trial Court. Hence, the original  complainant has preferred the present appeal.   3.   Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant has  vehemently submitted that in the facts and circumstances of the  case both the Learned Trial Court as well as the High Court have  committed a grave error in acquitting the original accused for the  offence under Section 138 of the N.I. Act.                                       6   3.1   It is further submitted by Learned Counsel appearing on  behalf of the original complainant – appellant herein that both the  Courts     below    have   not    appreciated   and/or   considered   the  presumption in favour of the complainant under Section 139 of the  N.I. Act. It is further submitted by Learned Counsel appearing on  behalf of the complainant that both the Courts below have  materially erred in acquitting the accused.      It is submitted that the  accused had admitted issuance of the cheque as well as the  signature on the cheque. It is submitted that therefore there is a  presumption under Section 139 of the N.I. Act in favour of the  complainant.       It is submitted that thereafter the onus would be  upon the accused to rebut the presumption and for that, the  accused has to lead the evidence.          It is submitted that in the  present case no evidence has been led on behalf of the accused to  rebut the presumption.           It is submitted that the presumption  mandatory by Section 139 of the N.I. Act includes the presumption  that there exists a legally enforceable debt or liability and therefore  both the Courts below have materially erred in acquitting the  accused.     In support of the above, reliance is placed on the                                  7   decisions of this Court in the case of Rangappa vs. Sri Mohan,  (2010) 11 SCC 441 and Kisan Rao vs. Shankargouda, (2018) 8  SCC 165.   3.2   It is further submitted by Learned Counsel appearing on  behalf of the complainant that even at the time of framing of the  charge against the accused and when his statement was recorded,  the accused had admitted that he had taken services of the Foreign  Exchange and Travel Card.       It is submitted that he had also  admitted that he had made part payment in discharge of the said  liability and some amount was remaining.       It is submitted that  therefore the accused was required to lead the evidence and prove  that the entire amount due and payable has been paid.          It is  submitted that therefore in view of the presumption under Section  139 of the N.I. Act, the Learned Trial Court ought to have convicted  the accused for the offence under Section 138 of the N.I. Act. It is  submitted that therefore the High Court has erred in confirming the  acquittal.                                   8   4.    The present appeal is vehemently opposed by the learned  counsel appearing on behalf of the accused.   4.1   It is vehemently submitted by Learned Counsel appearing on  behalf of the original accused that in the facts and circumstances of  the case both the courts below have not committed any error in  acquitting the accused.   4.2. It is further submitted that it is true that the cheque was  issued, but the same was issued towards the security.           It is  submitted that as such the complainant misused the cheque to  recover the dues of business from Ranger Export of India.       It is  submitted that there is a specific finding given by the Learned Trial  Court that the complainant failed to prove the legal liability and/or  the dues of the accused for which the cheque was issued.   4.3   It is submitted by Learned Counsel for the accused that in the  present case the accused has rebutted the presumption under  Section 139 of the N.I. Act and has demonstrated and proved that  there was no legal liability and/or the dues, due and payable to the  complainant.                                       9     4.4. Relying upon the decision of this Court in Basalingappa vs.  Mudibasappa, (2019) 5 SCC 418, it is submitted that as held by  this Court once there is probable defence on behalf of the accused,  thereafter the burden shifts on the complainant to prove his  financial capacity and other facts.   4.5    Making the above submissions and relying upon the cases, it  is prayed to dismiss the present appeal.   5      We have heard the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the  respective parties at great length.   5.1    We have considered minutely the evidence on record, both oral  as well documentary. We have also considered and gone through  the judgment and order passed by the Courts below acquitting the  respondents accused for the offence under Section 138 of the N.I.  Act.   5.2. What is emerging from the material on record is that the  issuance of cheque by the accused and the signature of the accused  on the said cheque are not disputed by the accused. The accused                                   10   has also not disputed that there were transactions between the  parties.   Even as per the statement of the accused, which was  recorded at the time of the framing of the charge, he has admitted  that some amount was due and payable. However, it was the case  on behalf of the accused that the cheque was given by way of  security and the same has been misused by the complainant.  However, nothing is on record that in the reply to the statutory  notice it was the case on behalf of the accused that the cheque was  given by way of security. Be that as it may, however, it is required  to be noted that earlier the accused issued cheques which came to  be dishonoured on the ground of ‘insufficient funds’ and thereafter  a fresh consolidated cheque of Rs. Rs.9,55,574/­ was given which  has been returned unpaid on the ground of “STOP PAYMENT”.  Therefore, the cheque in question was issued for the second time.  Therefore, once the accused has admitted the issuance of cheque  which bears his signature, there is presumption that there exists a  legally enforceable debt or liability under Section 139 of the N.I. Act.  However, such a presumption is rebuttable in nature and the  accused is required to lead the evidence to rebut such presumption.                                   11   The accused was required to lead evidence that the entire amount  due and payable to the complainant was paid.   6.    On the presumption under Section 139 of the N.I. Act few  decisions of this Court are required to be referred to and  considered.   6.1   In the case of K.N. Beena vs. Muniyappan, (2001) 8 SCC 458,  it is observed and held by this Court that under Section 118 of the  N.I. Act, unless the contrary is proved, it is to be presumed that the  negotiable instruments (including a cheque) had been made or  drawn for consideration. It is further observed and held that under  Section 139, the Court has to presume, unless the contrary is  proved, that the holder of the cheque received the cheque for  discharge, in whole or in part, of a debt or liability. It is further  observed that thus in complaints under Section 138, the Court has  to presume that the cheque had been issued for a debt or liability.  This presumption is rebuttable.     However, the burden of proving  that the cheque has not been issued for a debt or liability is on the  accused.                                    12     6.2   In the case of Rangappa (supra) again, this Court had an  occasion to consider the presumption of existence of a legally  enforceable debt or liability under Section 139 of the N.I. Act. In  the aforesaid decision, after considering other decisions of this  Court on Section 118(a) and 139 of N.I. Act, it is observed and held  that there exists a presumption which favours the complainant. It  is further observed that the presumption under Section 139 of the  N.I. Act is in the nature of a rebuttable presumption and it is open  to the accused to raise a defence wherein there is existence of  legally enforceable debt or liability can be contested. In Paragraph  27 this Court observed and has held as under:                “27. Section 139 of the Act is an example of a           reverse onus clause that has been included in           furtherance of the legislative objective of improving           the credibility of negotiable instruments. While           Section 138 of the Act specifies a strong criminal           remedy in relation to the dishonour of cheques,           the rebuttable presumption under Section 139 is a           device to prevent undue delay in the course of           litigation. However, it must be remembered that           the offence made punishable by Section 138 can           be better described as a regulatory offence since           the bouncing of a cheque is largely in the nature           of a civil wrong whose impact is usually confined           to the private parties involved in commercial           transactions. In such a scenario, the test of           proportionality should guide the construction and                                    13               interpretation of reverse onus clauses and the             defendant­accused    cannot be expected      to             discharge an unduly high standard or proof.”   6.3   In the case of Kishan Rao (Supra) after considering the  decision of this Court in the case of Kumar Exports vs. Sharma  Carpets, (2009) 2 SCC 513, it is observed and held that the  accused may adduce evidence to rebut the presumption, but mere  denial regarding existence of debt shall not serve any purpose. This  Court in paragraph 19 of that judgment considered paragraph 14,  15, 18 & 19 of the decision in the case of Kumar Exports (Supra)  as under:              19. This Court in Kumar Exports v. Sharma             Carpets (Supra), had considered the provisions of             the Negotiable Instruments Act as well the             Evidence Act. Referring to Section 139, this Court             laid down the following in paras 14, 15, 18 and             19:                   “14. Section 139 of the Act provides that it                  shall be presumed, unless the contrary is                  proved, that the holder of a cheque received                  the cheque of the nature referred to in                  Section 138 for the discharge, in whole or in                  part, of any debt or other liability.                   15. Presumptions are devices by use of                  which the courts are enabled and entitled to                  pronounce on an issue notwithstanding that                    14   there is no evidence or insufficient evidence. Under the Evidence Act all presumptions must come under one or the other class of the three classes mentioned in the Act, namely, (1) “may presume” (rebuttable), (2) “shall presume” (rebuttable), and (3) “conclusive presumptions” (irrebuttable). The term “presumption” is used to designate an inference, affirmative or disaffirmative of the existence of a fact, conveniently called the “presumed fact” drawn by a judicial tribunal, by a process of probable reasoning from some matter of fact, either judicially noticed or admitted or established by legal evidence to the satisfaction of the tribunal. Presumption literally means “taking as true without examination or proof”.                  *     *     * 18. Applying the definition of the word “proved” in Section 3 of the Evidence Act to the provisions of Sections 118 and 139 of the Act, it becomes evident that in a trial under Section 138 of the Act a presumption will have to be made that every negotiable instrument was made or drawn for consideration and that it was executed for discharge of debt or liability once the execution of negotiable instrument is either proved or admitted. As soon as the complainant discharges the burden to prove that the instrument, say a note, was executed by the accused, the rules of presumptions under Sections 118 and 139 of the Act help him shift the burden on the accused. The presumptions will live, exist and survive and shall end only when the contrary is proved by the accused, that is, the cheque was not issued for consideration and in discharge of any debt or liability. A presumption is not in itself evidence, but                                  15                  only makes a prima facie case for a party for                whose benefit it exists.                 19. The use of the phrase “until the contrary                is proved” in Section 118 of the Act and use                of the words “unless the contrary is proved”                in Section 139 of the Act read with                definitions of “may presume” and “shall                presume” as given in Section 4 of the                Evidence Act, makes it at once clear that                presumptions to be raised under both the                provisions     are    rebuttable.   When    a                presumption is rebuttable, it only points out                that the party on whom lies the duty of going                forward with evidence, on the fact presumed                and when that party has produced evidence                fairly and reasonably tending to show that                the real fact is not as presumed, the purpose                of the presumption is over.”  6.4   Now so far as the reliance is placed by Learned Counsel  appearing on behalf of the accused on the decision of this Court in  the case of Basalingappa (supra), on going through the said  decision, we are of the opinion that the said decision shall not be  applicable to the facts of the case on hand and/or the same shall  not be of any assistance to the accused. In that case before this  Court, the defence by the accused was that the cheque amount was  given by the complainant to the accused by way of loan. When the  proceedings were initiated under Section 138 of the N.I. Act the  accused denied the debt liability and the accused raised the defence                                  16   and questioned the financial capacity of the complainant. To that,  the complainant failed to prove and establish his financial capacity.  Therefore, this Court was satisfied that the accused had a probable  defence and consequently in absence of complainant having failed  to prove his financial capacity, this Court acquitted the accused. In  the present case, the accused never questioned the financial  capacity of the complainant. We are of the view that whenever the  accused has questioned the financial capacity of the complainant in  support of his probable defence, despite the presumption under  Section 139 of the N.I. Act about the presumption of legally  enforceable debt and such presumption is rebuttable, thereafter the  onus shifts again on the complainant to prove his financial capacity  and at that stage the complainant is required to lead the evidence to  prove his financial capacity, more particularly when it is a case of  giving loan by cash and thereafter issuance of a cheque. That is not  a case here.   7.   Coming back to the facts in the present case and considering  the fact that the accused has admitted the issuance of the cheques  and his signature on the cheque and that the cheque in question                                   17   was issued for the second time, after the earlier cheques were  dishonoured and that even according to the accused some amount  was due and payable, there is a presumption under Section 139 of  the N.I. Act that there exists a legally enforceable debt or liability.  Of course such presumption is rebuttable in nature. However, to  rebut the presumption the accused was required to lead the  evidence that full amount due and payable to the complainant has  been paid. In the present case, no such evidence has been led by  the accused.    The story put forward by the accused that the  cheques were given by way of security is not believable in absence  of further evidence to rebut the presumption and more particularly  the cheque in question was issued for the second time, after the  earlier cheques were dishonoured. Therefore, both the courts below  have materially erred in not properly appreciating and considering  the presumption in favour of the complainant that there exists  legally enforceable debt or liability as per Section 139 of the N.I.  Act. It appears that both, the Learned Trial Court as well as the  High Court, have committed error in shifting the burden upon the  complainant to prove the debt or liability, without appreciating the                                  18   presumption under Section 139 of N.I. Act.      As observed above,  Section 139 of the Act is an example of reverse onus clause and  therefore once the issuance of the cheque has been admitted and  even the signature on the cheque has been admitted, there is  always a presumption in favour of the complainant that there exists  legally enforceable debt or liability and thereafter it is for the  accused to rebut such presumption by leading evidence.   8.   In view of the reasons stated above, the impugned judgment  and order passed by the High Court and that of the Metropolitan  Magistrate acquitting the original accused ­ respondents herein for  the offence under Section 138 of the N.I. Act cannot be sustained  and the same deserves to be quashed and set aside and are  accordingly quashed and set aside.        The original accused ­  respondents herein are held guilty for the offence under Section 138  of the N.I. Act. All the original accused ­ respondents herein are  therefore, convicted under Section 138 of the N.I. Act.     Original  Accused No.2 to 4 Respondent No.2 to Respondent No.4 herein are  sentenced to undergo three months simple imprisonment with a  fine of Rs.10,000/­ each and in default thereof to undergo further                                      19   one   month    simple   imprisonment.           The    original   accused     ­  respondents    herein   are   also        directed    to   pay    a   sum    of  Rs.19,11,148/­ to the original complainant by way of compensation  to be paid within a period of eight weeks from today.  9.    Present appeal is accordingly allowed.   CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 272 OF 2020   10.   Now so far as this appeal arising out of the impugned  judgment and order passed by the High Court in Crl. L.P. No.  259/2018 arising out of the judgment and order passed by the  learned trial Court in Criminal Complaint No. 62/15 (new no.  613738/16) acquitting the original accused for the offence under  Section 138 of the N.I. Act is concerned, the only difference is with  respect to the cheques amount. In the present case, four cheques  each of Rs. 1,00,000/­ were issued which came to be dishonoured.  Except the cheques amount, there is no difference.  11.   For the reasons stated in Criminal Appeal No. 271 of 2020  which has been allowed today, this appeal is also allowed.                  The  impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court as well as                                  20   that of the trial Court acquitting the original accused – respondents  herein for the offence under Section 138 of the N.I. Act cannot be  sustained and the same deserves to be quashed and set aside and  are accordingly quashed and set aside.         The original accused ­  respondents herein are held guilty for the offence under Section 138  of the N.I. Act. All the original accused ­ respondents herein are  therefore, convicted under Section 138 of the N.I. Act.         Original  Accused No.2 to 4 ­ Respondent No.2 to Respondent No.4 herein are  sentenced to undergo three months simple imprisonment with a  fine of Rs.10,000/­ each and in default thereof, to undergo further  one   month   simple   imprisonment.         The   original   accused   ­  respondents herein are also directed to pay a sum of Rs.8,00,000/­  to the original complainant by way of compensation to be paid  within a period of eight weeks from today.                                                 ……..…………………..J.

Ramasubramanian, J.             1.             Aggrieved by the refusal of the High Court to quash a First            Information Report (FIR for short) registered against them for the            offences punishable under Sections 34, 471, 468, 467, 420, 419            and 406 IPC, the petitioner has come up with the above Special            Leave Petition.            2.             We have heard Dr. Abhishek Manu Singhvi, learned senior            counsel appearing for the petitioner. Mr. Maninder Singh, learned            senior counsel appears for the 3rd Respondent, who is the de facto Signature Not Verified  Digitally signed by Sanjay Kumar Date: 2020.11.26 17:03:17 IST Reason:           complainant.                                                                                      1 3.   The petitioner is a Company headquartered in Pune and is  engaged in the business of manufacture, import and sale of  passenger vehicles in India. It is claimed that the petitioner has  been formed by the amalgamation of three Companies by name  Skoda Auto India Private Limited, Volkswagen India Private Limited  and Volkswagen Group Sales India Private Limited. The petitioner  claims that they are responsible for the business operations of five  automobile brands namely, Skoda, Volkswagen, Audi, Porsche and  Lamborgini.  4.   The Automotive Research Association of India, which is a  research institution of the automotive industry attached to the  Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises of the  Government of India issued a notice dated 04.11.2015 to the  Managing      Directors   of   Skoda   Auto   India   Private   Limited,  Volkswagen India Private Limited and Volkswagen Group Sales  India Private Limited, calling upon them to show cause as to why  they should not come to the conclusion that the vehicles  manufactured and sold by them in India, are in violation of the  requirements of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules. It was alleged in                                                                         2 the said notice that the study carried out by them on limited vehicle  models fitted with Diesel EA 189 Engines led them to believe that  the vehicles manufactured by Volkswagen, when tested on road,  indicate 3­9 times more NOx pollution compared with the tests  carried out in the laboratory on Modified Indian Driving Cycle  (MIDC). It was also alleged in the said notice that they had reason  to believe that Diesel EA 189 Engines fitted in BS­IV vehicles are  equipped with what are called ‘defeat devices’.  5.   At about the same time, two original applications came to be  filed before the National Green Tribunal (NGT for short), Principal  Bench. Both the applications were primarily against Skoda Auto  India Private Limited, Volkswagen India Private Limited and  Volkswagen Group Sales India Private Limited. Apart from these  three companies, the Union of India (UOI), the Central Pollution  Control Board (CPCB) and a few others were also made parties to  the original applications.  6.

On 16.11.2018, the NGT recorded a prima facie finding that  the claim of the manufacturers that they had not caused any  damage to the environment, was not acceptable. The Tribunal  constituted a joint team to give an expert opinion and in the mean                                                                                   5 time directed the manufacturers to deposit Rs. 100 crores with the  CPCB.  8.    The manufacturers filed appeals before this Court in C.A. Nos.  11928 and 11929 of 2018, against the preliminary finding and the  interim direction issued by the NGT. During the pendency of those  appeals, the Expert Team filed a Report.  9.    Therefore, this Court disposed of the aforesaid Civil Appeals  giving liberty to the manufacturers to file objections to the Report of  the Expert Team and directed the Tribunal to consider those  objections and to pass orders.  10.   Pursuant to the said order of this Court, the NGT allowed the  manufacturers to file objections and heard both the original  applications and disposed of the same by order dated 07.03.2019.  Some of the findings and directions by the Tribunal were:­             (i)     That the manufacturers had in fact used cheat                    devices to suppress the laboratory tests;             (ii)    That NOx emission was higher by Portable Emission                    Measurement System (PEMS);             (iii)   That Volkswagen vehicles gave much less NO x                    emission under the Warm Test Cycles after recall;                                                                         6           (iv)   That the emissions measured on PEMS were higher                  than BS­IV limit;            (v)    That the manufacturers are liable to pay damages to                  the tune of Rs.500 crores; and            (vi)   That the CPCB shall consider initiation of                  prosecution in the light of applicable statutory                  regime.  11.   Challenging the said order dated 07.03.2019 of the NGT, two  Civil Appeals were filed in C.A.Nos. 4069 and 4086 of 2019. On  06.05.2019 these appeals were taken up along with another Civil  Appeal filed by the Inter­Continental Association of lawyers and this  court ordered the issue of notice in the appeals. In the mean time,  this Court directed that no coercive steps shall be taken against  Volkswagen India Private Limited.  12.   While things stand thus, the 3rd Respondent herein lodged a  complaint with the S.H.O., Gautam Budh Nagar, on 10.07.2020,  alleging that he had bought 7 Audi Brand cars from the authorised  dealers of the manufacturing Companies; that at the time of  purchase, he got it clarified from the Company that they had not  installed any cheat devices in the vehicles sold in India; that  however, the authorities in India found out a higher emission of                                                                      7 NOx; that even the NGT imposed a fine; that the complainant  thereafter realised that he had been duped by the Company; that  knowing fully well that their vehicles have been installed with cheat  devices, the manufacturer had prepared wrong records and  documents; that the manufacturers and the officers of the  manufacturers are therefore guilty of various offences under the IPC  and that therefore action should be initiated against them.  13.   Contending that as per the particulars mentioned in the  VAHAN Portal of the Government, the 3rd Respondent herein had  purchased only 3 and not 7 vehicles; that the complaint lodged by  the 3rd Respondent after more than 2½ years of the purchase of the  vehicles, was malicious and full of false particulars; and that the  FIR is based entirely upon the order of the NGT, which is the  subject matter of two civil appeals before this Court, the petitioner  filed a Criminal Miscellaneous Writ Petition No.9233 of 2020 before  the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad. In the said Writ Petition,  the petitioners sought quashing of the FIR.  14.   By an order dated 01.10.2020, the Allahabad High Court  rejected the prayer for quashing of the FIR. However, the High                                                                      8 Court protected the officers of the petitioner against arrest till the  submission of the Report under Section 173(2) Cr.P.C. subject  however to the condition that they shall cooperate in the  investigation and also appear as and when called upon to assist in  the investigation.  15.   Not satisfied with a mere protection against arrest and the  refusal of the Allahabad High Court to quash the FIR, the petitioner  has come up with the above SLP.  16.   The main contentions of the petitioner are:­             (i)    That the Police cannot investigate an issue, the                   substratum of which is sub judice before this Court                   in the civil appeals arising out of the order of the                   NGT; and            (ii)   That the High Court failed to take note of the long                   delay on the part of the 3 rd Respondent in lodging                   the complaint and also the fact that the VAHAN                   Portal of the Government shows the purchase of                   only 3 vehicles as against the claim of the 3rd                   Respondent to have purchased 7 vehicles.   17. Let us take up the second contention first, since it is capable  of being dealt with, without much ado. The second contention has                                                                      9 two parts namely (i) that there is a long delay in lodging the  complaint and (ii) that the 3rd Respondent­complainant, appears to  have purchased only 3 vehicles as against his claim to have  purchased 7 vehicles.  18. The   question   whether    the   3rd    Respondent­complainant  purchased 3 vehicles as revealed by the VAHAN Portal of the  Government or 7 vehicles as claimed by him in his complaint, is a  question of fact which has to be established only in the course of  investigation/trial. In a petition for quashing the FIR, the Court  cannot go into disputed questions of fact.  19. The mere delay on the part of the 3 rd Respondent­complainant  in lodging the complaint, cannot by itself be a ground to quash the  FIR. The law is too well settled on this aspect to warrant any  reference to precedents. Therefore, the second ground on which the  petitioner seeks to quash the FIR cannot be countenanced.  20. The first contention revolves around the pendency of the Civil  Appeals arising out of the order of the NGT and the interim order  passed by this Court in the Civil Appeals.                                                                     10 21. As stated earlier, two original applications came to be filed  before the NGT in the year 2015, alleging that the manufacturers of  the vehicles in question were employing deceit devices. The filing of  the original applications coincided with the issue of notice by the  Automotive Research Association of India to the manufacturers.  We have already indicated broadly, in paragraphs 5­10 above as to  what transpired before the NGT.  22. The applicants before the NGT did not seek any relief for  themselves, as purchasers of vehicles. The reliefs sought by the  applicants before the NGT were broad and general. This is why the  NGT, by its final order dated 07.03.2019 directed only the CPCB to  consider the initiation of prosecution in the light of the applicable  statutory regime, while ordering the manufacturers to deposit  Rs.500 crores as compensation for the damage caused to the  environment.  23. Therefore, the order of the NGT, passed on the applications  filed by certain individuals not claiming as purchasers of vehicles,  cannot be taken as an impediment for an individual who  purchased cars from the manufacturers, to lodge a complaint, if he                                                                     11 has actually suffered on account of any representation made by the  manufacturers.  24. The interim order passed by this Court on 06.05.2019 in Civil  Appeal Nos. 4069 and 4086 of 2019, while issuing notice reads as  follows:­             “In the meantime, no coercive steps shall be taken             against the appellant viz., Volkswagen India Private             Limited.”  25.   The aforesaid interim order correlates only to the directions  issued by the NGT in paragraphs 29, 30 and 32 of its order dated  07.03.2019. The direction contained in Paragraph 30 of the order of  the NGT dated 07.03.2019 reads as follows:­              “We leave it open to the CPCB to consider initiation of             prosecution in the light of applicable statutory regime.”  26.   In paragraphs 29 and 32 of its order, the NGT directed the  manufacturers to deposit compensation to the tune of Rs.500  crores within 2 months.  27.   Therefore, the interim order passed by this Court not to take  any coercive steps has to be understood only in the context of the  aforesaid directions of the NGT which became the subject matter of  the Civil Appeals. Hence it is futile to contend that the pendency of  the Civil Appeals and the interim order passed by this Court should                                                                         12 be taken as a deterrent for anyone else to lodge a police complaint  and seek an investigation.  28.   Dr. A.M. Singhvi, learned senior counsel appearing for the  petitioner strenuously contended that the contents of the complaint  lodged by the 3rd Respondent­complainant with the Police were  nothing but a reproduction of the contentions made before the NGT  and that actually the substratum of the police complaint, is what is  sub judice before this court. Therefore, he contends that the police  cannot investigate into the same set of allegations which form the  subject matter of proceedings pending adjudication before this  court.  29.   But we do not think so. A little elaboration is required to show  why we cannot agree with the above contention of the learned  senior counsel appearing for the petitioner.  30.   Section 110(1) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 empowers the  Central Government to make rules, regulating the construction,  equipment and maintenance of motor vehicles with respect to all or  any of the matters enumerated in Clauses (a) to (p). Clause (g) of                                                                        13 Sub­section (1) of Section 110 relates to “the emission of smoke,  visible vapour, sparks, ashes, grit, or oil”.  31.   In exercise of powers conferred by Section 110(1), the Central  Government issued a set of rules known as The Central Motor  Vehicles Rules, 1989.  32.   Rules 112 to 114 of those Rules deal in general with “smoke,  vapour, spark, ashes, grit and oil”. Rules 115 and 116 deal  specifically with “emissions of smoke, vapour” etc., from motor  vehicles and “test for smoke emission level and Carbon Monoxide  (CO) level for motor vehicles”. These Rules correspond to Clause (g)  of Sub­section (1) of Section 110.  33.   Rule 126 mandates every manufacturer or importer of motor  vehicles other than trailers and semi­trailers to submit the  prototype of the vehicle manufactured or imported by him for  testing by the agencies indicated therein. Rule 126A enables the  testing agencies referred to in Rule 126 to conduct tests on the  vehicles drawn from the production line of the manufacturer to  verify whether these vehicles conform to the provisions of the Rules.                                                                       14 34.   In order to give effect to the mandate of the statutory  prescription, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, issued  a document bearing No. MoRTH/CMV/TAP­116­116, Issue No.4,  which prescribes the test method, testing equipment and other  related procedure for the purpose of testing vehicles for verifying  compliance with Rules 115 and 126A of the Rules for “Type  Approval and Conformity of Production”. The document also  contains the total procedure for checking of the in­service vehicles  for idling CO/HC for vehicles fitted with petrol/CNG/LPG Engines.  This document is divided into 15 parts. Part­XIV contains the  details of standards for Tailpipe Emissions from vehicles and Test  Procedures Effective for Mass Emission Standards.  35.   Clause No.2.27 of Chapter­1, Part­XIV of the aforesaid  document defines what is called a “Defeat Device”. It reads as  follows:­          “Defeat Device means any element of design which         senses temperature, vehicle speed, engine rotational         speed, transmission gear, manifold vacuum or any         other parameter for the purpose of activating,         modelling, delaying or deactivating the operation of         any part of the emission control system, that         reduces the effectiveness of the emission control                                                                     15         system under conditions which may reasonably be         expected to be encountered in normal vehicle         operation and use. Such an element of design may not         be considered a defeat device if         1. The need of the device is justified in terms of protecting         the engine against damage or accident and for safe         operation of the vehicle, or         2. The device does not function beyond the requirements         of engine starting or,         3. Conditions are substantially included in the Type I or         Type VI test procedure.”   36. The allegations in the complaint lodged by the 3 rd respondent  herein, are to the following effect:  (i) that “at the time of purchase and taking delivery of the vehicles,  the complainant got clarified from the accused persons whether the  vehicles in India were also fitted with cheat devices”;  (ii) that despite the clarification issued by them that they had not  installed any cheat devices, in the vehicles meant to be sold in  India, the cars purchased by the complainant were found to contain  such defeat devices; and  (iii) that therefore, the manufacturer is guilty of commission of  various offences.  37.   The question whether such devices are installed in the cars  purchased by the 3rd respondent herein and the question whether                                                                           16 there was any representation in this regard to the petitioner, are all  questions of fact, peculiar and particular to the 3 rd respondent  herein. NGT had no occasion to examine the cars purchased by the  3rd respondent herein. At this stage no one can presume whether  the defence of the manufacturer to the police complaint will be  purely on a question of fact or purely on a question of law or on  mixed questions of fact and law. If the petitioner takes a defence  that no such devices were installed in the cars purchased by the 3 rd  respondent or that there was no (mis)representation in this regard,  it will be a pure question of fact, which cannot be gone into in a  quash petition. If the petitioner takes a defence that the installation  of such devices, though true, does not violate any law, then it will  be a pure question of law. We may be entitled to go into this  question in a quash petition, provided the petitioner comes up with  a categorical admission that they had installed such devices and yet  there was no violation of the law. We do not expect the petitioner to  disclose their defence at this stage nor would we speculate what  type of defence the petitioner would have to the prosecution.                                                                        17 38.   It may not be out of context to mention here that the  European Union woke up way back in 2007 to the reality of car  makers installing a software that manipulate exhaust emissions,  depending upon whether the car ran on a test stand or on the road.  After the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre found in  2011 that the levels of harmful NO x emissions far exceeded the  prescribed levels, a study conducted by the International Council  on Clean Transportation (ICCT) revealed similar results in the  United States. In September­2015, allegations of installation of  manipulation devices by car manufacturers emerged from the US  Environmental Protection Agency and this triggered investigations  in several European Union States. After claims were lodged and  legal action    initiated, the   German   Federal Motor     Transport  Authority appears to have given permission in June­2016 for the  recall of about 2 million vehicles across Europe. In the light of these  developments, one of the manufacturers entered into an agreement  with the US Environmental Protection Agency in December­2016  giving certain options to the customers. These and the subsequent  developments,    which   attained   notoriety   as   the   diesel­gate                                                                       18 scandal,    led   to   the   German     Federal    Court      of   Justice  (Bundesgerichtshof­BGH) giving a ruling on May 25, 2020 in favour  of the car owners for damages.  39.   It is in the backdrop of what transpired in Europe and U.S.A.,  during the period from 2015 to 2019 that the action initiated by the  Automotive Research Association of India in November 2015 and  the proceedings that went on before the National Green Tribunal  from the year 2015 to the year 2019, have to be seen. All of them  were part of the global outrage that actually concerned the damage  caused to the environment by the emissions from the cars allegedly  fitted with manipulative devices. The proceedings before the NGT  were not intended to address issues relating to individuals, such as  (i) whether any emissions manipulation software, called in common  parlance as ‘defeat devices’ were installed in the vehicles purchased  by certain individuals; and (ii) whether any representation was  made to the purchasers of the cars in which such devices had been  installed, about the emission efficiency level of the cars.  40.   Therefore, we are unable to agree with the contention of the  learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner that the substratum of the                                                                         19 police complaint is something that is already the subject matter of  adjudication before this Court in the appeals arising out of the  order of the NGT. As a matter of fact, the High Court has been fair  to the petitioner, by granting protection against arrest till the filing  of the report under section 173(2) of the Code. We do not think that  the petitioner can ask for anything more.  41.     It is needless to point out that ever since the decision of the Privy  Council in King Emperor vs. Khwaja Nazir Ahmed1, the law is well  settled that Courts would not thwart any investigation. It is only in  cases where no cognizable offence or offence of any kind is disclosed  in the first information report that the Court will not permit an  investigation to go on.       As cautioned by this Court in State of  Haryana vs. Bhajan Lal2, the power of quashing should be exercised  very sparingly and with circumspection and that too in the rarest of  rare cases. While examining a complaint, the quashing of which is  sought, the Court cannot embark upon an enquiry as to the reliability  or genuineness or otherwise of the allegations made in the FIR or in  the complaint. In S.M. Datta vs. State of Gujarat3, this Court again 1 AIR 1945 PC 18 2 (1992) Supp. (1) SCC 335 3 (2001) 7 SCC 659                                                                            20 cautioned that criminal proceedings ought not to be scuttled at the  initial stage. Quashing of a complaint should rather be an exception  and a rarity than an ordinary rule. In S.M. Datta (supra), this Court  held that if a perusal of the first information report leads to disclosure  of an offence even broadly, law courts are barred from usurping the  jurisdiction of the police, since the two organs of the State operate in  two specific spheres of activities and one ought not to tread over the  other sphere.   42. In view of what is stated above, the special leave petition is  dismissed. There will be no order as to costs.                                                ……………………………..CJI                                                      (S.A.

We have heard Mr. Harish Salve and Mr. Neeraj Kishan Kaul,  Signature Not Verified                          learned Senior counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner. Digitally signed by MAHABIR SINGH Date: 2020.05.22                           On behalf of the respondent, we have heard Mr. Tushar Mehta, 17:34:40 IST Reason:                                                                                                         1 learned Solicitor General and Mr. Huzeffa Ahmadi, learned Senior  counsel at some length, even at the time of the admission.  3.    The learned sole arbitrator has passed the arbitral award  dated 29.03.2016 in respect of Package-I holding as follows:-               “Based on my findings above, I have no hesitation in coming       to the considered finding that the contract itself provides rate(s) for       payment of extra lead in item Nos.2.7 and 3.4 of the BOO for surface       and underground structures respectively. Admittedly material had       been transported from a lead much longer than that envisaged at the       time of award of work in favour of the claimant. It is also an admitted       case of the parties that the claimant is entitled to extra payment for       the extra lead. The only point at issue is whether Clause 33(ii)(a) or       Clause 33(iii) would be applicable for working out the rate payable for       transportation. In view of my findings, I have no hesitation in holding       that the payment of extra lead is to be determined in accordance with       Clause 33(ii)(a) for the item which has deviated being already       available in the contract.             I, therefore, answer the reference as follows:               The rate for extra lead for transportation of sand and boulders       from Government approved quarries to the work site for package-I       works under KaHEP shall be decided in terms of Clause 33(ii)(a) of       Part-III, Volume-I, Conditions of Contract of Book-II of Contract       Agreement No.NEEPCO/ED/QP/C&P/R/C/KaHEP/560 of 2004-05       dated 17.12.2004.”  Similar Declaratory Arbitral Awards dated 29.03.2016 were passed  by the learned sole arbitrator in respect of the other two Arbitral  References in respect of contracts pertaining to Package-II and  Package-III of the project.  4.    Respondent-North Eastern Electric Power Corporation Ltd.  (NEEPCO) filed three applications under Section 34 of the  Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 before the Additional Deputy                                                                                  2 Commissioner (Judicial), Shillong challenging the three arbitral  awards dated 29.03.2016 in respect of Packages-I, II and III. The  Additional Deputy Commissioner (Judicial) vide common judgment  dated 27.04.2018 rejected the applications under Section 34 of the  Act and upheld all the three arbitral awards. The respondent-  NEEPCO filed three appeals under Section 37 of the Act before the  High Court in Arbitration Appeal No(s).3, 4 and 5 of 2018. By the  common judgment dated 26.02.2019, the High Court allowed the  respondent’s appeals and set aside the common judgment dated  27.04.2018 passed by the Additional Deputy Commissioner  (Judicial).  5.    Aggrieved by the common judgment dated 26.02.2019, the  petitioner preferred special leave petitions before the Supreme  Court in SLP (C) Nos.13629-13631 of 2019. After hearing both the  parties, the Supreme Court vide order dated 19.07.2019 dismissed  all the three SLPs filed by the petitioner holding that the Court is not  inclined to interfere in the matters.  6.    After dismissal of the SLPs, the petitioner filed review petitions  before the High Court on the ground that the judgment of the High  Court dated 26.02.2019 suffers from error apparent on the face of  the record as it had not taken into consideration the amendments                                                                         3 made to Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 by Amendment Act of  2015. The said review petitions came to be dismissed by the High  Court vide the impugned orders.  7.     We heard the matter at some length at the time of admission  and carefully considered the submissions of the learned counsel  appearing for the parties and the judgments relied upon by both the  sides and the judgment of the High Court dated 26.02.2019 and  other materials on record.  8.     Contention of the learned Senior counsel for the petitioner is  that dismissal of the earlier SLP vide order dated 19.07.2019 is a  non-speaking order and not on merits and hence no objection could  be taken for filing of the review petition. Placing reliance upon  Bussa Overseas1 and Constitution Bench decisions in Durga  Shankar Mehta2, it was submitted that Article 136 of the Constitution  confers on the Supreme Court special or residuary powers which  are exercisable outside the purview of the ordinary laws in cases  where the needs of justice demand interference by the Supreme  Court. It was submitted that in paragraph (30) of Bussa Overseas3,  the Supreme Court held that though the decision in Shanker   1 Bussa Overseas and Properties Private Limited and Another v. Union of India and Another (2016) 4 SCC 696 2   Durga Shankar Mehta v. Thakur Raghuraj Singh and Others (1955) 1 SCR 267 3 Bussa Overseas and Properties Private Limited and Another v. Union of India and Another (2016) 4 SCC 696                                                                                          4 Motiram Nale4 referred to Order 47 Rule 7 of the Code of Civil  Procedure bars an appeal against the order of the court rejecting  the review, it is not to be understood that the court has curtailed the  plenary jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution by taking  recourse to the provisions in the Code of Civil Procedure.  9.     Mr. Tushar Mehta, learned Solicitor General also relied upon  Bussa Overseas5 and contended that the appeal is not maintainable  against the order rejecting the application for review of judgment  and such appeal is not against the main judgment. In support of his  contention, learned Solicitor General has placed reliance upon  paragraph (22), which reads as under:-         “22. Recently in Sandhya Educational Society vs. Union of India        (2014) 7 SCC 701, the Court referred to the decision in Vinod        Kapoor vs. State of Goa (2012) 12 SCC 378 and opined thus: (SCC        p. 706, para 16)           “16. This Court in Vinod Kapoor v. State of Goa (2012) 12 SCC           378, has categorically observed that once the special leave           petition is dismissed as withdrawn without obtaining           appropriate permission to file a special leave petition once over           again after exhausting the remedy of review petition before the           High Court, the same is not maintainable.”   10.    After considering the Constitution Bench decision in Durga  Shankar Mehta6 and number of other judgments, in Bussa  Overseas7, the Court held that consistency is the cornerstone of the 4   Shanker Motiram Nale v. Shiolalsing Gannusing Rajput (1994) 2 SCC 753 5 Bussa Overseas and Properties Private Limited and Another v. Union of India and Another (2016) 4 SCC 696 6   Durga Shankar Mehta v. Thakur Raghuraj Singh and Others (1955) 1 SCR 267 7 Bussa Overseas and Properties Private Limited and Another v. Union of India and Another (2016) 4 SCC 696                                                                                          5 administration of justice and courts have evolved and formulated a  principle that if the basic judgment is not assailed and the challenge  is only to the order passed in review, the Supreme Court is obliged  not to entertain such special leave petitions. In paragraphs (30) and  (31) of Bussa Overseas8, the Supreme Court held as under:-         “30. The decisions pertaining to maintainability of special leave        petition or for that matter appeal have to be seemly understood.        Though in the decision in Shanker Motiram Nale Shiolalsing        Gannusing Rajput (1994) 2 SCC 753, the two-Judge Bench        referred to Order 47 Rule 7 of the Code of Civil Procedure that bars        an appeal against the order of the court rejecting the review, it is        not to be understood that the Court has curtailed the plenary        jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution by taking recourse        to the provisions in the Code of Civil Procedure. It has to be        understood that the Court has evolved and formulated a principle        that if the basic judgment is not assailed and the challenge is only        to the order passed in review, this Court is obliged not to entertain        such special leave petition. The said principle has gained the        authoritative status and has been treated as a precedential        principle for more than two decades and we are disposed to think        that there is hardly any necessity not to be guided by the said        precedent.        31. In this context, we may profitably reproduce a passage from        State of A.P. v. A.P. Jaiswal (2001) 1 SCC 748, wherein a three-        Judge Bench has observed thus: (SCC p. 761, para 24)          “24. Consistency is the cornerstone of the administration of          justice. It is consistency which creates confidence in the system          and this consistency can never be achieved without respect to          the rule of finality. It is with a view to achieve consistency in          judicial pronouncements, the courts have evolved the rule of          precedents, principle of stare decisis, etc. These rules and          principle are based on public policy….” (emphasis supplied)     8 Bussa Overseas and Properties Private Limited and Another v. Union of India and Another (2016) 4 SCC 696                                                                                          6 The     Supreme        Court     held     that    the    decision      rendered       in  Thungabhadra Industries Ltd.9 is not correct.  11.    It was submitted by the learned Solicitor General and  learned Senior counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent that  the earlier SLP was heard at length and thereafter, the SLP came to  be dismissed as there was no ground to interfere in the matters.  After dismissal of the SLP and without seeking for liberty, the  petitioner thereafter filed the review petition.  12.    In our considered view, it is not necessary to go into the  question of maintainability of these SLPs preferred against the order  rejecting the review, after the challenge to the main judgment had  been rejected in the earlier SLPs. As noted earlier, in this case, the  judgment of the High Court under Section 37 of the Act was  challenged before the Supreme Court and the SLPs were dismissed  by the Supreme Court after hearing the Senior Counsel for the  parties vide order dated 19.07.2019. Be it noted when the earlier  SLPs were dismissed, no liberty was taken to file the review before  the High Court. Be that as it may, we are not inclined to go into this  aspect any further.     9 Thungabhadra Industries Ltd. v. Government of Andhra Pradesh Represented by the Deputy Commissioner of Commercial Taxes, Anantapur (1964) 5 SCR 174                                                                                         7 13.      On behalf of the petitioner, Mr. Harish Salve and Mr. Neeraj  Kishan Kaul, learned Senior counsel mainly contended that in the  judgment of the High Court dated 26.02.2019, the High Court  erroneously applied the provisions as applicable prior to the  Amendment Act, 2015 and the judgment of the High Court suffers  from error apparent on the face of the record since the High Court  relied upon the decision in Saw Pipes Ltd.10 and Western Geco  International Limited11, which are no longer good law after the  Amendment Act, 2015 brought into effect from 23.10.2015. It is  submitted that the judgment of the High Court dated 26.02.2019  suffers from error apparent on the face of the record and therefore,  the petitioner is justified in seeking the review of the judgment dated  26.02.2019 and the High Court was not right in rejecting the review  petition. In support of the contention of the petitioners, reliance was  placed upon HRD Corporation12 and Ssangyong Engineering and  Construction Company Limited13.  14.      Mr. Tushar Mehta, learned Solicitor General and Mr. Huzeffa  Ahmadi, learned Senior counsel have submitted that at the time  when the earlier SLP(C) Nos.13629-13631 of 2019 were heard,  10 Oil & Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. v. Saw Pipes Ltd. (2003) 5 SCC 705 11 Oil & Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. v. Western Geco International Limited (2014) 9 SCC    263 12 HRD Corporation (Marcus Oil and Chemical Division) v. GAIL (India) Limted (2018) 12 SCC 471 13 Ssangyong Engineering and Construction Company Limited v. National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) (2019) 15 SCC 131, Para No.19                                                                                          8 they were heard at length and all the arguments including the effect  of the amendment to Section 34 was also raised and only thereafter,  the earlier SLPs came to be dismissed. It was submitted that though  the dismissal of order dated 19.07.2019 is a non-speaking order, the  petitioner had raised all contentious points, now urged, and faced  an order of dismissal, and the petitioner cannot be allowed to  reagitate the matter by filing a review petition.  15.    In Board of Control for Cricket in India14, the Supreme Court  held that the Amendment Act, 2015 would apply to Section 34  petitions that are made after 23.10.2015 (the day on which the  Amendment Act came into force). In the present case, admittedly,  after the arbitral awards are dated 29.03.2016, the applications  under Section 34 of the Act were filed before the Judicial  Commissioner, Shillong as per the decision in Board of Control for  Cricket in India15, the provisions of the Amendment Act would apply.  16.    Patent illegality as a ground for setting aside a domestic  award was first expounded in the judgment of Saw Pipes Ltd.16  where this Court was dealing with a domestic award. This Court  gave a wider interpretation to the ‘public policy of India’ in Section   14 Board of Control for Cricket in India v. Kochi Cricket Private Limited and Others (2018) 6 SCC 287 15 Board of Control for Cricket in India v. Kochi Cricket Private Limited and Others (2018) 6 SCC 287 16 Oil & Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. v. Saw Pipes Ltd. (2003) 5 SCC 705                                                                                             9 34(2)(b)(ii) in Part I of the 1996 Act. The Court held that an award  would be “patently illegal”, if it is contrary to the substantive  provisions of law; or, provisions of the 1996 Act; or, terms of the  contract.  17.     In the subsequent judgment of Associate Builders17, this Court  discussed the ground of patent illegality as a ground under public  policy for setting aside a domestic award. The relevant extract of the  judgment in Associate Builders case (supra) reads as follows:-          “40. Patent Illegality         We now come to the fourth head of public policy namely, patent         illegality. It must be remembered that under the explanation to         Section 34(2)(b), an award is said to be in conflict with the public         policy of India if the making of the award was induced or affected         by fraud or corruption. This ground is perhaps the earliest ground         on which courts in England set aside awards under English law.         Added to this ground (in 1802) is the ground that an arbitral award         would be set aside if there were an error of law by the arbitrator….”         “42. In the 1996 Act, this principle is substituted by the 'patent         illegality' principle which, in turn, contains three sub heads-         42.1 (a) a contravention of the substantive law of India would result         in the death knell of an arbitral award. This must be understood in         the sense that such illegality must go to the root of the matter and         cannot be of a trivial nature. This again is a really a contravention of         Section 28(1)(a) of the Act, which reads as under:             28. Rules applicable to substance of dispute.--(1) Where the             place of arbitration is situated in India,-                 (a) in an arbitration other than an international                 commercial arbitration, the arbitral tribunal shall                 decide the dispute submitted to arbitration in                 accordance with the substantive law for the time                 being in force in India;         42.2 (b) a contravention of the Arbitration Act itself would be         regarded as a patent illegality-for example if an arbitrator gives no   17 Associate Builders v. Delhi Development Authority (2015) 3 SCC 49, paras 40 to 45.                                                                                          10        reasons for an award in contravention of Section 31(3) of the Act,        such award will be liable to be set aside.        42.3 (c) Equally, the third sub-head of patent illegality is really a        contravention of Section 28(3) of the Arbitration Act, which reads as        under:            28. Rules applicable to substance of dispute.-            (3) In all cases, the arbitral tribunal shall decide in            accordance with the terms of the contract and shall take into            account the usages of the trade applicable to the            transaction.        This last contravention must be understood with a caveat. An        arbitral tribunal must decide in accordance with the terms of the        contract, but if an arbitrator construes a term of the contract in a        reasonable manner, it will not mean that the award can be set aside        on this ground. Construction of the terms of a contract is primarily        for an arbitrator to decide unless the arbitrator construes the        contract in such a way that it could be said to be something that no        fair minded or reasonable person could do.” (emphasis supplied)  18.    The Law Commission in its 246th Report18 recommended the  insertion of the ground of ‘patent illegality’ for setting aside a  domestic award by the insertion of clause (2A) in Section 34 of the  Act. The relevant extract from the Report of the Law Commission is  extracted herein below:-         “It is for this reason that the Commission has recommended the        addition of section 34 (2A) to deal with purely domestic awards,        which may also be set aside by the Court if the Court finds that        such award is vitiated by “patent illegality appearing on the face of        the award.” In order to provide a balance and to avoid excessive        intervention, it is clarified in the proposed proviso to the proposed        section 34 (2A) that such “an award shall not be set aside merely        on the ground of an erroneous application of the law or by        reappreciating evidence.” The Commission believes that this will go        a long way to assuage the fears of the judiciary as well as the other        users of arbitration law who expect, and given the circumstances        prevalent in our country, legitimately so, greater redress against        purely domestic awards. This would also do away with the        unintended consequences of the decision of the Supreme Court in        ONGC v. Saw Pipes Ltd, (2003) 5 SCC 705, which, although in the  18 Available at : http://lawcommissionofindia.nic.in/reports/Report246.pdf                                                                                 11       context of a purely domestic award, had the unfortunate effect of       being extended to apply equally to both awards arising out of       international commercial arbitrations as well as foreign awards,       given the statutory language of the Act. …” (emphasis supplied)    To give effect to the said recommendation, it was suggested that:        “(iii) After the Explanation in sub-section (2), insert sub-section ‘(2A)       An arbitral award arising out of arbitrations other than international       commercial arbitrations, may also be set aside by the Court if the       Court finds that the award is vitiated by patent illegality appearing       on the face of the award. Provided that an award shall not be set       aside merely on the ground of an erroneous application of the law       or by re-appreciating evidence.’       [NOTE: The proposed S.34(2A) provides an additional, albeit       carefully limited, ground for setting aside an award arising out of a       domestic arbitration (and not an international commercial       arbitration). The scope of review is based on the patent illegality       standard set out by the Supreme Court in ONGC Ltd. v. Saw Pipes       Ltd., (2003) 5 SCC 705. The proviso creates exceptions for       erroneous application of the law and re-appreciation of evidence,       which cannot be the basis for setting aside awards.]” (emphasis       supplied)   19.   Pursuant to the recommendations of the Law Commission,  the 1996 Act was amended by Act 3 of 2016, which came into force  w.e.f. 23.10.2015. The ground of “patent illegality” for setting aside a  domestic award has been given statutory force in Section 34(2A) of  the 1996 Act. The ground of “patent illegality” cannot be invoked in  international commercial arbitrations seated in India. Even in the  case of a foreign award under the New York Convention, the ground  of “patent illegality” cannot be raised as a ground to resist  enforcement, since this ground is absent in Section 48 of the 1996                                                                                      12 Act. The newly inserted sub-section (2A) in Section 34, reads as  follows:-         “(2A) An arbitral award arising out of arbitrations other than        international commercial arbitrations, may also be set aside by the        Court, if the Court finds that the award is vitiated by patent illegality        appearing on the face of the award :        Provided that an award shall not be set aside merely on the ground        of an erroneous application of the law or by reappreciation of        evidence.”    20.    In Ssangyong Engineering and Construction Company  Limited19, this Court was considering a challenge to an award  passed in an international commercial arbitration, between the  Appellant – company a foreign entity registered under the laws of  Korea, and the Respondent, a Government of India undertaking. In  paragraph (19) of the judgment, this Court noted that the expansive  interpretation given to “public policy of India” in the Saw Pipes  (supra) and Western Geco International Limited 20 cases, which had  been done away with, and a new ground of “patent illegality” was  introduced which would apply to applications under Section 34  made on or after 23.10.2015. In paragraphs (36) and (37) of the  judgment, this Court held that insofar as domestic awards are  concerned, the additional ground of patent illegality was now  available under sub-section (2A) to Section 34. However, re- 19 Ssangyong Engineering and Construction Company Limited v. National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) (2019) 15 SCC 131 20 Oil & Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. v. Western Geco International Limited (2014) 9 SCC      263                                                                                       13 appreciation of evidence was not permitted under the ground of  “patent illegality” appearing on the face of the award.  21.   In paragraphs (39) and (40) of Ssangyong Engineering  (supra), the Court reiterated paragraphs (42.2) and (42.3) of  Associate Builders (supra) wherein, it was held that the construction  of the terms of a contract is primarily for an arbitrator to decide,  unless the arbitrator construes a contract in a manner which no fair  minded or reasonable person would take i.e. if the view taken by the  arbitrator is not even a possible view to take. In paragraphs (39) and  (40), the Supreme Court held as under:-        “39. To elucidate, para 42.1 of Associate Builders v. Delhi       Development Authority (2015) 3 SCC 49, namely, a mere       contravention of the substantive law of India, by itself, is no longer       a ground available to set aside an arbitral award. Para 42.2 of       Associate Builders v. Delhi Development Authority (2015) 3 SCC       49, however, would remain, for if an arbitrator gives no reasons for       an award and contravenes Section 31(3) of the 1996 Act, that       would certainly amount to a patent illegality on the face of the       award.         40. The change made in Section 28(3) by the Amendment Act       really follows what is stated in paras 42.3 to 45 in Associate       Builders v. Delhi Development Authority (2015) 3 SCC 49, namely,       that the construction of the terms of a contract is primarily for an       arbitrator to decide, unless the arbitrator construes the contract in       a manner that no fair-minded or reasonable person would; in short,       that the arbitrator’s view is not even a possible view to take. Also, if       the arbitrator wanders outside the contract and deals with matters       not allotted to him, he commits an error of jurisdiction. This ground       of challenge will now fall within the new ground added       under Section 34(2-A).” (emphasis supplied)                                                                                    14 22.     The present case arises out of a domestic award between two  Indian entities. The ground of patent illegality is a ground available  under the statute for setting aside a domestic award, if the decision  of the arbitrator is found to be perverse, or, so irrational that no  reasonable person would have arrived at the same; or, the  construction of the contract is such that no fair or reasonable person  would take; or, that the view of the arbitrator is not even a possible  view.  23.     In the present case, the High Court has referred to the  judgment in Associated Builders (supra) at length in paragraph (42)  of its judgment dated 26.02.2019 and arrived at the correct  conclusion that an arbitral award can be set aside under Section 34  if it is patently illegal or perverse. This finding of the High Court is in  conformity with paragraph (40) of the judgment of this Court in  Ssangyong Engineering (supra).  24.     In the present case, the High Court in paragraph (51) has held  that no reasonable person could have arrived at a different  conclusion while interpreting Clauses 2.7 and 3.4 of the BoQ and  Clauses 32(ii)(a) and 33(iii) of the Conditions of Contract. Any other  interpretation of the above clauses would definitely be irrational and  in defiance of all logic. The relevant extract reads:-                                                                           15       “51. …Clause 33(iii) specifically provides that “if the rates for such       items of work cannot be determined in the manner as specified in       Clause 33(ii), the rates for such items to be executed shall be       determined by the Engineer-in-Charge on the basis of actual and       analysed cost taking the following into consideration the rates for       such items of works as are required to be executed due to       deviations as stated in sub-clause shall be payable in the manner       as stated hereunder…..”. We are of the firm view that this is the       only possible interpretation of Clauses 2.7 and 3.4 of the BoQ and       Clauses 32(ii)(a) and 33(iii) of the Conditions of Contract. No       reasonable person would arrive at a different conclusion while       interpreting Clauses 2.7 and 3.4 of the BoQ and Clauses 32(ii)(a)       and 33(iii) of the Conditions of Contract. Any other interpretation of       the above clauses would definitely be irrational and defiance of all       logic.” (emphasis supplied)    25.   The High Court in paragraph (52) came to the finding that the  findings in the award suffer from the vice of irrationality and  perversity, and held as follows:-        “52. The Arbitral Awards and the findings of the learned Arbitrator       suffer from the vice of perversity. The learned Arbitrator has taken       into account various factors irrelevant in coming to the decision and       has ignored vital clauses of the tender documents like Clause 2 and       various Sub-clauses i.e. Sub-clauses 2.1 to 2.8.7 under Clause 2       and Clause 3 and various Sub-Clauses i.e. Sub-clauses 3.1 to 3.7       under Clause 3 of the BoQ, Clause 2 and various Sub-clauses i.e.       Sub-clause 2.1 to 2.17.7 under Clause 2 and Clause 3 and various       Sub-clauses i.e. Sub-clause 3.1 to 3.10.5 under Clause 3 of       “Particular Technical Specifications”, Vol. 2, Part II. The learned       Arbitrator has taken into consideration an irrelevant fact that while       making provisional payment, the initial lead of 3.0 km has been       deducted and that this shows that Clause 2.7 and 3.4 of the BoQ       are applicable. The provisional payment was an interim       arrangement and was preceded by meetings dated 07.12.2012 and       08.12.2012 wherein it was specifically agreed between the parties       that HoP, NEEPCO would take steps for referring the dispute to       arbitration and that till the arbitral award, the payment would be       made as per the prevailing provisional rate without any escalation       and that final rate payable for transportation of sand and boulder       shall be done on implementation of the arbitral award. As such the       fact that provisional payment was made by deducting initial lead of       3.0 km was an irrelevant fact for deciding the issue. The findings of       the learned Arbitrator having been arrived at by taking into account       irrelevant factors and by ignoring vital clauses, the same suffers                                                                                 16 from vice of irrationality and perversity.

SHAH, J.             1.             Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned            judgment and order dated 14.09.2016/19.09.2016 passed by the            High Court of Himachal Pradesh, Shimla in Criminal Appeal No.            36 of 2014, by which the High Court has allowed the said appeal            preferred by the State and has quashed and set aside the            judgment and order of acquittal passed by the learned trial Court            acquitting the appellant herein – original accused for the offences            under Sections 376 and 506 of the IPC and consequently has Signature Not Verified  Digitally signed by ARJUN BISHT Date: 2020.12.03 17:03:05 IST Reason:            convicted the appellant – accused for the aforesaid offences and                                                                               1 has sentenced him to undergo seven years R.I. with fine of Rs.  10,000/­ and in default of payment of fine, further six months  R.I. under Section 376 IPC and four years R.I. with fine of  Rs.5,000/­ and in default of payment of fine, further three  months R.I. under Section 506 IPC, the original accused has  preferred the present appeal.  2.   The facts leading to the present appeal in nutshell are as  under:       That the father of the prosecutrix lodged an FIR against the  accused   with   the   allegations   that   on   1.4.2008,   his   wife  Dhaneshwari Devi telephonically informed him at Shimla that  their daughter (prosecutrix) is pregnant. It was alleged that the  prosecutrix told her mother that when she used to go to jungle to  graze goats and cattle, accused also used to go to jungle to graze  cattle and goats. The prosecutrix told her mother that three­four  months ago, accused had sexual intercourse with her forcibly  and without her consent.        That the accused threatened the  prosecutrix not to disclose the incident to anyone. That due to  fear and due to forgetting the same and further due to mental  weakness, she did not disclose about the incident to anyone                                                                         2 including her mother.     That the prosecutrix was got medically  examined and as per the Medical Officer the prosecutrix was  carrying a pregnancy of 31 weeks. Her age was stated to be 19  years. Prosecutrix was alleged to be mentally retarded. She was  medically examined at IGMC, Shimla as well as PGI, Chandigarh.  Prosecutrix gave birth to a female child on 19.6.2008 at KNH,  Shimla.   Blood samples of the prosecutrix, the baby and the  accused were taken for DNA test. As per report, accused was the  biological father of the female child. The accused was arrested.  After completion of the investigation, the Investigating Officer  submitted the chargesheet against the accused for the offences  under Sections 376 and 506 IPC. The accused pleaded not guilty  and therefore he came to be tried by the learned trial Court for  the aforesaid offences.  2.1   To prove the case against the accused, the prosecution  examined as many as 23 witnesses including the parents of the  prosecutrix (PW 1 & 2), Prosecutrix (PW3), Laboratory Technician  – Jitender Kumar (PW8), Dr. Sarla Chand (PW9), Dr. Rakesh  Kumar, Radiologist (PW10), Dr. Ramesh Kumar, Assistant  Professor, Department of Psychiatry (PW11), Dr. Jeeva Nand                                                                   3 Chauhan (PW12), Nand Singh, Sr. Lab Technician, KNH, Shimla  (PW13), Dr. Monika Sharma (PW14), ASI Takpa Dorje (PW17), SI  Sunder Singh (PW19), Dr. Rama Malhotra, PGI, Chandigarh  (PW22) and other witnesses. That after closure of the evidence  on behalf of the prosecution, statement of the accused under  Section 313 Cr.P.C. was recorded. He pleaded total innocence.  The learned trial Court acquitted the accused mainly on the  ground of delay in lodging the FIR and also on the ground that  the prosecutrix was not mentally unsound to understand the  consequences and what was happening.  3.   Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the judgment and  order of acquittal passed by the learned trial Court, the State  preferred appeal before the High Court and by the impugned  judgment and order and on re­appreciation of the entire evidence  on record, more particularly the medical evidence, the High Court  has reversed the order of acquittal and has convicted the accused  for the offences under Sections 376 and 506 IPC by observing  that the prosecutrix was not in a position to understand the good  and bad aspect of the sexual assault. On re­appreciation of the  entire evidence on record, the High Court came to the conclusion                                                                    4 that the IQ of the prosecutrix was 62 and that she had mild  mental retardation.  4.    Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned  judgment and order of conviction and sentence passed by the  High Court convicting the accused for the aforesaid offences, the  original accused has preferred the present appeal.  5.    Ms. Radhika Gautam, learned Advocate has appeared for  the appellant and Mr. Sarthak Ghonkrokta, Advocate has  appeared for the respondent­State.  5.1   Ms. Radhika Gautam, learned Advocate appearing on behalf  of the appellant – accused has vehemently submitted that in the  facts and circumstances of the case the High Court has  materially erred in reversing the acquittal and convicting the  accused in an appeal against acquittal.     It is submitted that  cogent reasons were given by the learned trial Court, which were  on appreciation of the evidence on record, and therefore the same  were not required to be interfered with by the High Court in  exercise of the appellate jurisdiction in an appeal against  acquittal.                                                                     5 5.2    Learned counsel for the appellant­accused has made the  following submissions:  i)     there was a delay of four months in registering the FIR from  the time the prosecution claimed the incident occurred and  therefore the learned trial Court rightly acquitted the accused;  ii)    even the father of the prosecutrix (PW1) clearly deposed that  the appellant – accused was called to discuss the matter and he  offered to take care of the child but refused to marry the  prosecutrix. It is submitted therefore that the FIR was filed only  as a vengeful act. It is submitted that the appellant­accused was  not in a position to marry the prosecutrix as the appellant was  married and was having the children of his own;  iii)   as such there is a delay of 8 months from the date of  incident in filing the FIR.   It is submitted that the prosecutrix  when examined the day after registering the FIR dated 22.4.2008  is found to be carrying a foetus of 8 months. It is submitted that  it is not believable that the parents were not aware of the  pregnancy of the prosecutrix;  iv)    as such the prosecutrix was not suffering from mild mental  retardation as claimed by the prosecution. It is submitted that                                                                     6 two psychiatrists gave a different account of which language the  prosecutrix seems to know.     It is submitted that one says she  knew ‘Hindi’ and other says she knew ‘Phari’ and he had to use  the interpreter. It is submitted that this is a major discrepancy  in the prosecution’s case when one Doctor who is supposed to  have assessed her for mental faculties and therefore must have  asked her many questions which she spoke in Hindi and the  other Doctor who is also supposed to ask her a lot of questions in  Phari and he had to use the interpreter.      It is submitted that  therefore either both of them or at least one of them is not stating  the true facts;  v)    even there are material contradictions in the deposition of  the prosecutrix as well as the mother, sister and father of the  prosecutrix inasmuch as the prosecutrix said that she came to  know about her pregnancy from her family members when they  told her about it, whereas the testimony of the mother, sister and  father reveal that it was clearly the prosecutrix who informed her  sister about the pregnancy;  vi)   the High Court has mainly relied upon the medical evidence  of PW22 while coming to the conclusion that the prosecutrix was                                                                      7 having mild mental retardation. It is submitted that deposition of  PW22 is compared with the deposition of other family members.  As rightly observed by the learned trial Court, the prosecutrix  was a person capable of understanding her welfare and quite  intelligent.  5.3   Making the above submissions and relying upon the  decision of this Court in the case of Krishna v. State of Karnataka  (2014) 15 SCC 596, it is submitted that the High Court has  clearly erred in reversing the order of acquittal passed by the  learned trial Court which was based on appreciation of evidence  on record and the view taken by the learned trial Court was a  plausible view.  5.4   It is further submitted by the learned Advocate appearing on  behalf of the appellant – accused that out of seven years  imprisonment, the accused has already undergone four years  and therefore it is prayed to allow the present appeal and quash  and set aside the impugned judgment and order passed by the  High Court and in the alternative to reduce the sentence to the  period already undergone by the accused.                                                                       8 6.    While opposing the present appeal, the learned Advocate  appearing on behalf of the State has vehemently submitted that  in the facts and circumstances of the case the High Court has  rightly reversed the order of acquittal passed by the learned trial  Court and has rightly convicted the accused for the offences  under Sections 376 and 506 IPC, more particularly when the  prosecutrix was suffering from mental disease and as per the  medical evidence she was not in a position to understand the  good and bad aspect of sexual assault.  6.1   Learned counsel for the State has made the following  submissions:  i)    as the first appellate court the High Court was well within  its jurisdiction to re­appreciate the entire evidence on record and  to come to the right conclusion.      It is submitted that in the  present case the High Court has rightly re­appreciated the entire  evidence on record, more particularly the medical evidence;  ii)   the aspect of delay in lodging the FIR has already been dealt  with and considered by the High Court. It is submitted that as  such the accused had taken undue advantage of the mental  condition of the prosecutrix and therefore even if there is any                                                                    9 material contradiction, the benefit shall not go to the accused  and the benefit must go in favour of such a victim who is  suffering from a mental disease and not in a position to  understand the good and bad aspect of sexual assault;  iii)   that in the present case even the conduct on the part of the  accused is also required to be appreciated. It is submitted that it  is an admitted position that the accused had sexually intercourse  with the prosecutrix and because of that the prosecutrix was  pregnant and delivered a baby child.         Accused is not now  disputing that the child does not belong to him.       Despite the  above, in his 313 Cr.P.C. statement his case was of a total denial  and innocence and it was not even his case that the prosecutrix  was a consenting party and that he had sexually intercourse with  the consent of the prosecutrix.     It is submitted that thus the  accused in his 313 statement came out with a false case and did  not state the true facts;  iv)    now so far as the submission on behalf of the accused that  out of seven years RI, the accused has undergone four years RI  and therefore the same may be considered in favour of the  accused is concerned, it is submitted that the minimum sentence                                                                    10 provided for the offence under Section 376 is seven years and the  same can be reduced only by giving a special reasons.        It is  submitted that in the present case, as such, the High Court has  already taken a lenient view by awarding seven years RI only. It  is submitted that when it is a case of sexual assault on a person  suffering from mental sickness and the accused has taken  disadvantage of the mental condition of the victim, such cases  should be dealt with an iron hand and no leniency should be  shown to such accused.  6.2   Making the above submissions, it is prayed to dismiss the  present appeal.  7.    We have heard the learned counsel for the respective parties  at length.        At the outset, it is required to be noted that by the  impugned judgment and order the High Court has convicted the  accused for the offences under Section 376 and 506 IPC. It is  also required to be noted that on re­appreciation of the evidence,  the High Court found that the IQ of the victim was very low and  she was suffering from mental illness and she was not in a  position to understand good and bad aspect of sexual assault. It                                                                  11 is also required to be noted and it is not in dispute that the  accused had sexually intercourse with the victim and that the  victim delivered a baby child and that the accused is found to be  the biological father of the baby child delivered by the victim. It  is also required to be noted that in the 313 statement the case of  the accused was of a total denial. It was not his case that it was  a case of consent. Thus, the accused, as such, came with a false  defence.  8.   It is true that the learned trial Court acquitted the accused.  However, the High Court on re­appreciation of the entire evidence  on record has found the accused guilty for the offences under  Sections 376 & 506 IPC and has reversed the order of acquittal  passed by the learned trial Court. It is the case on behalf of the  appellant­accused that in an appeal against order of acquittal  passed by the learned trial Court, the High Court has committed  a grave error in convicting the accused and reversing the order of  acquittal passed by the learned trial Court. Therefore, the first  thing which is required to be considered in the facts and  circumstances of the case is, whether the High Court is justified                                                                      12 in interfering with the order of acquittal passed by the learned  trial Court and thereby convicting the accused?  9.     Before considering the appeal on merits, the law on the  appeal against acquittal and the scope and ambit of Section 378  Cr.P.C. and the interference by the High Court in an appeal  against acquittal is required to be considered.  9.1          In the case of Babu v. State of Kerala, (2010) 9 SCC  189), this Court had reiterated the principles to be followed in an  appeal     against    acquittal     under    Section     378    Cr.P.C.        In  paragraphs 12 to 19, it is observed and held as under:          12. This Court time and again has laid down the guidelines for the       High Court to interfere with the judgment and order of acquittal       passed by the trial court. The appellate court should not ordinarily       set aside a judgment of acquittal in a case where two views are       possible, though the view of the appellate court may be the more       probable one. While dealing with a judgment of acquittal, the       appellate court has to consider the entire evidence on record, so as       to arrive at a finding as to whether the views of the trial court were       perverse or otherwise unsustainable. The appellate court is entitled       to consider whether in arriving at a finding of fact, the trial court       had failed to take into consideration admissible evidence and/or       had taken into consideration the evidence brought on record       contrary to law. Similarly, wrong placing of burden of proof may       also be a subject­matter of scrutiny by the appellate court. (Vide       Balak Ram v. State of U.P (1975) 3 SCC 219, Shambhoo Missir v.       State of Bihar (1990) 4 SCC 17, Shailendra Pratap v. State of U.P       (2003) 1 SCC 761, Narendra Singh v. State of M.P (2004) 10 SCC       699, Budh Singh v. State of U.P (2006) 9 SCC 731, State of U.P. v.       Ram Veer Singh (2007) 13 SCC 102, S. Rama Krishna v. S. Rami       Reddy (2008) 5 SCC 535, Arulvelu v. State (2009) 10 SCC 206,                                                                                   13 Perla Somasekhara Reddy v. State of A.P (2009) 16 SCC 98 and Ram Singh v. State of H.P (2010) 2 SCC 445) 13. In Sheo Swarup v. King Emperor AIR 1934 PC 227, the Privy Council observed as under: (IA p. 404) “… the High Court should and will always give proper weight and consideration to such matters as (1) the views of the trial Judge as to the credibility of the witnesses; (2) the presumption of innocence in favour of the accused, a presumption certainly not weakened by the fact that he has been acquitted at his trial; (3) the right of the accused to the benefit of any doubt; and (4) the slowness of an appellate court in disturbing a finding of fact arrived at by a Judge who had the advantage of seeing the witnesses.” 14. The aforesaid principle of law has consistently been followed by this Court. (See Tulsiram Kanu v. State AIR 1954 SC 1, Balbir Singh v. State of Punjab AIR 1957 SC 216, M.G. Agarwal v. State of Maharashtra AIR 1963 SC 200, Khedu Mohton v. State of Bihar (1970) 2 SCC 450, Sambasivan v. State of Kerala (1998) 5 SCC 412, Bhagwan Singh v. State of M.P(2002) 4 SCC 85 and State of Goa v. Sanjay Thakran (2007) 3 SCC 755) 15. In Chandrappa v. State of Karnataka (2007) 4 SCC 415, this Court reiterated the legal position as under: (SCC p. 432, para 42) “(1) An appellate court has full power to review, reappreciate and reconsider the evidence upon which the order of acquittal is founded. (2) The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 puts no limitation, restriction or condition on exercise of such power and an appellate court on the evidence before it may reach its own conclusion, both on questions of fact and of law. (3) Various expressions, such as, ‘substantial and compelling reasons’, ‘good and sufficient grounds’, ‘very strong circumstances’, ‘distorted conclusions’, ‘glaring mistakes’, etc. are not intended to curtail extensive powers of an appellate court in an appeal against acquittal. Such phraseologies are more in the nature of ‘flourishes of language’ to emphasise the reluctance of an appellate court to interfere with acquittal than to curtail the power of the court to review the evidence and to come to its own conclusion. (4) An appellate court, however, must bear in mind that in case of acquittal, there is double presumption in favour of the accused. Firstly, the presumption of innocence is available to him under the fundamental principle of criminal jurisprudence that every person shall be presumed to be innocent unless he is proved guilty by a competent court of law. Secondly, the accused having secured his acquittal, the presumption of his innocence is further reinforced, reaffirmed and strengthened by the trial court.                                                                             14 (5) If two reasonable conclusions are possible on the basis of the evidence on record, the appellate court should not disturb the finding of acquittal recorded by the trial court.” 16. In Ghurey Lal v. State of U.P (2008) 10 SCC 450, this Court reiterated the said view, observing that the appellate court in dealing with the cases in which the trial courts have acquitted the accused, should bear in mind that the trial court’s acquittal bolsters the presumption that he is innocent. The appellate court must give due weight and consideration to the decision of the trial court as the trial court had the distinct advantage of watching the demeanour of the witnesses, and was in a better position to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses. 17. In State of Rajasthan v. Naresh (2009) 9 SCC 368, the Court again examined the earlier judgments of this Court and laid down that: (SCC p. 374, para 20) “20. … an order of acquittal should not be lightly interfered with even if the court believes that there is some evidence pointing out the finger towards the accused.” 18. In State of U.P. v. Banne (2009) 4 SCC 271, this Court gave certain illustrative circumstances in which the Court would be justified in interfering with a judgment of acquittal by the High Court. The circumstances include: (SCC p. 286, para 28) “(i) The High Court’s decision is based on totally erroneous view of law by ignoring the settled legal position; (ii) The High Court’s conclusions are contrary to evidence and documents on record; (iii) The entire approach of the High Court in dealing with the evidence was patently illegal leading to grave miscarriage of justice; (iv) The High Court’s judgment is manifestly unjust and unreasonable based on erroneous law and facts on the record of the case; (v) This Court must always give proper weight and consideration to the findings of the High Court; (vi) This Court would be extremely reluctant in interfering with a case when both the Sessions Court and the High Court have recorded an order of acquittal.” A similar view has been reiterated by this Court in Dhanapal v. State (2009) 10 SCC 401.  19. Thus, the law on the issue can be summarised to the effect that in exceptional cases where there are compelling circumstances, and the judgment under appeal is found to be perverse, the appellate court can interfere with the order of acquittal. The appellate court should bear in mind the presumption of innocence of the accused and further that the trial                                                                            15       court’s acquittal bolsters the presumption of his innocence.       Interference in a routine manner where the other view is possible       should be avoided, unless there are good reasons for interference.”  9.2          When the findings of fact recorded by a court can be  held to be perverse has been dealt with and considered in  paragraph 20 of the aforesaid decision, which reads as under:        “20. The findings of fact recorded by a court can be held to be       perverse if the findings have been arrived at by ignoring or       excluding relevant material or by taking into consideration       irrelevant/inadmissible material. The finding may also be said to       be perverse if it is “against the weight of evidence”, or if the finding       so outrageously defies logic as to suffer from the vice of       irrationality. (Vide Rajinder Kumar Kindra v. Delhi Admn (1984) 4       SCC 635, Excise and Taxation Officer­cum­Assessing Authority v.       Gopi Nath & Sons 1992 Supp (2) SCC 312, Triveni Rubber & Plastics       v. CCE 1994 Supp. (3) SCC 665, Gaya Din v. Hanuman Prasad       (2001) 1 SCC 501, Aruvelu v. State (2009) 10 SCC 206 and Gamini       Bala Koteswara Rao v. State of A.P (2009) 10 SCC 636).”                                                      (emphasis supplied)   9.3          It is further observed, after following the decision of  this Court in the case of Kuldeep Singh v. Commissioner of Police  (1999) 2 SCC 10, that if a decision is arrived at on the basis of no  evidence or thoroughly unreliable evidence and no reasonable  person would act upon it, the order would be perverse. But if  there is some evidence on record which is acceptable and which  could be relied upon, the conclusions would not be treated as  perverse and the findings would not be interfered with.                                                                                      16 9.4    In the recent decision of Vijay Mohan Singh v. State of  Karnataka, (2019) 5 SCC 436, this Court again had an occasion  to consider the scope of Section 378 Cr.P.C. and the interference  by the High Court in an appeal against acquittal.                This Court  considered catena of decisions of this Court right from 1952  onwards. In paragraph 31, it is observed and held as under:          “31. An identical question came to be considered before this Court       in Umedbhai Jadavbhai (1978) 1 SCC 228. In the case before this       Court, the High Court interfered with the order of acquittal passed       by the learned trial court on re­appreciation of the entire evidence       on record. However, the High Court, while reversing the acquittal,       did not consider the reasons given by the learned trial court while       acquitting the accused. Confirming the judgment of the High       Court, this Court observed and held in para 10 as under: (SCC p.       233)          “10. Once the appeal was rightly entertained against the order of          acquittal, the High Court was entitled to reappreciate the entire          evidence independently and come to its own conclusion.          Ordinarily, the High Court would give due importance to the          opinion of the Sessions Judge if the same were arrived at after          proper appreciation of the evidence. This rule will not be          applicable in the present case where the Sessions Judge has          made an absolutely wrong assumption of a very material and          clinching aspect in the peculiar circumstances of the case.”        31.1. In Sambasivan v. State of Kerala (1998) 5 SCC 412, the High       Court reversed the order of acquittal passed by the learned trial       court and held the accused guilty on re­appreciation of the entire       evidence on record, however, the High Court did not record its       conclusion on the question whether the approach of the trial court       in dealing with the evidence was patently illegal or the conclusions       arrived at by it were wholly untenable. Confirming the order passed       by the High Court convicting the accused on reversal of the       acquittal passed by the learned trial court, after being satisfied       that the order of acquittal passed by the learned trial court was       perverse and suffered from infirmities, this Court declined to       interfere with the order of conviction passed by the High Court.                                                                               17 While confirming the order of conviction passed by the High Court, this Court observed in para 8 as under: (SCC p. 416)    “8. We have perused the judgment under appeal to ascertain   whether the High Court has conformed to the aforementioned   principles. We find that the High Court has not strictly   proceeded in the manner laid down by this Court in Ramesh   Babulal Doshi v. State of Gujarat (1996) 9 SCC 225 viz. first   recording its conclusion on the question whether the approach   of the trial court in dealing with the evidence was patently illegal   or the conclusions arrived at by it were wholly untenable, which   alone will justify interference in an order of acquittal though the   High Court has rendered a well­considered judgment duly   meeting all the contentions raised before it. But then will this   non­compliance per se justify setting aside the judgment under   appeal? We think, not. In our view, in such a case, the approach   of the court which is considering the validity of the judgment of   an appellate court which has reversed the order of acquittal   passed by the trial court, should be to satisfy itself if the   approach of the trial court in dealing with the evidence was   patently illegal or conclusions arrived at by it are demonstrably   unsustainable and whether the judgment of the appellate court   is free from those infirmities; if so to hold that the trial court   judgment warranted interference. In such a case, there is   obviously no reason why the appellate court’s judgment should   be disturbed. But if on the other hand the court comes to the   conclusion that the judgment of the trial court does not suffer   from any infirmity, it cannot but be held that the interference by   the appellate court in the order of acquittal was not justified;   then in such a case the judgment of the appellate court has to   be set aside as of the two reasonable views, the one in support of   the acquittal alone has to stand. Having regard to the above   discussion, we shall proceed to examine the judgment of the trial   court in this case.”  31.2. In K. Ramakrishnan Unnithan v. State of Kerala (1999) 3 SCC 309, after observing that though there is some substance in the grievance of the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the accused that the High Court has not adverted to all the reasons given by the trial Judge for according an order of acquittal, this Court refused to set aside the order of conviction passed by the High Court after having found that the approach of the Sessions Judge in recording the order of acquittal was not proper and the conclusion arrived at by the learned Sessions Judge on several aspects was unsustainable. This Court further observed that as the Sessions    Judge    was   not   justified   in   discarding   the relevant/material evidence while acquitting the accused, the High                                                                           18 Court, therefore, was fully entitled to reappreciate the evidence and record its own conclusion. This Court scrutinised the evidence of the eyewitnesses and opined that reasons adduced by the trial court for discarding the testimony of the eyewitnesses were not at all sound. This Court also observed that as the evaluation of the evidence made by the trial court was manifestly erroneous and therefore it was the duty of the High Court to interfere with an order of acquittal passed by the learned Sessions Judge.  31.3. In Atley v. State of U.P. AIR 1955 SC 807, in para 5, this Court observed and held as under: (AIR pp. 809­10) “5. It has been argued by the learned counsel for the appellant that the judgment of the trial court being one of acquittal, the High Court should not have set it aside on mere appreciation of the evidence led on behalf of the prosecution unless it came to the conclusion that the judgment of the trial Judge was perverse. In our opinion, it is not correct to say that unless the appellate court in an appeal under Section 417 Cr.P.C came to the conclusion that the judgment of acquittal under appeal was perverse it could not set aside that order. It has been laid down by this Court that it is open to the High Court on an appeal against an order of acquittal to review the entire evidence and to come to its own conclusion, of course, keeping in view the well­established rule that the presumption of innocence of the accused is not weakened but strengthened by the judgment of acquittal passed by the trial court which had the advantage of observing the demeanour of witnesses whose evidence have been recorded in its presence. It is also well settled that the court of appeal has as wide powers of appreciation of evidence in an appeal against an order of acquittal as in the case of an appeal against an order of conviction, subject to the riders that the presumption of innocence with which the accused person starts in the trial court continues even up to the appellate stage and that the appellate court should attach due weight to the opinion of th"

In pursuance of advertisement for the posts      of PTI, 20,836 applications were received      by the Commission. The notification dated      28.12.2006 was published by the Commission      to   the   effect       that   the   Commission     has      decided to hold the written examination on                         4       21.01.2007.

Notification      further mentioned that Viva-voice will be      of    25   marks.    The       notification       further      provided    that    candidates       equal       to   three      times of the vacancies will be called for      interview based on their performance in the      written test. The written examination was      held on 21.02.2007.    2.3. A public notice was issued on 01.02.2007 by      the    Commission        that       due    to     several                                5       complaints/reports                       with         regard          to      malpractices          and           cheating         committed        in      written     examination                  held    on    21.01.2007,      Commission       has           decided          to     cancel       the      aforesaid examination.    2.4. Another notice dated 11.06.2008 was issued      by the Commission re-notifying the written      examination          for       the        PTI    on    20.07.2008.      However,     before            the        written      examination      could    take        place          on    20.07.2008,            another      notice dated 30.06.2008 was issued by the      Commission            cancelling                 the             written      examination          to        be        held    on    20.07.2008.      Another      notice             dated           11.07.2008           was      published       by    the       Commission            to    shortlist      the   candidates           for       interview.            The    notice      mentioned that keeping in view the large      number     of        applications,               Commission          has      decided to shortlist eight times candidates      of the advertised post in the respective      category    for        interview            on       the    basis     of                          6       essential                academic              advertised      qualification.       Notice      also    mentioned         the      minimum weighted score of each category.    2.5. On 18.07.2008, the interview schedule was      published by the Commission which provided      that Interview was notified from 02.09.2008      to 17.10.2008. 15,582 candidates appeared      in     the   interview.         One    member       of     the      Commission     and   one     expert      member      headed      each    Interview        Committee      from    A    to     H.      Although the interview was completed in the      year    2008   itself,       the      Commission         could      declare the result of the selection after      one and half years only on 10.04.2010 which      was published on 11.04.2010. At the end of      the result as published in the newspaper,      criteria     adopted      for    selection      was       also      mentioned to the following effect: -           “CRITERIA            ADOPTED          FOR          SELECTION:           The criteria adopted by the          Commission for making selection          is given below: -                                            7                   1)      Academic marks…………60 Marks                      2)Marks obtained in the Viva                        voice out of …………………………30                        Marks                       Total: 90- Marks”    3.      Challenging the Select list dated 10.04.2010,  large    number      of      writ     petitions        were     filed   in    the  Punjab and Haryana High Court including CWP No.15656  of 2010, Sanjeev Kumar and others versus State of  Haryana      and     others.         The       writ    petitioners          before  filing writ petitions had obtained information under  Right to Information Act details of which information  were mentioned in the writ petition. Various grounds  were    taken      in    the       writ    petition       to    challenge     the  selection. The writ petitioners pleaded in the writ  petition     that        some       of     the    candidates         have    been  awarded more than 25 marks in viva-voice. Further,  some    of    the       candidates             have    been     selected      and  appointed       who          did     not        possess        the    requisite  qualification           of   certificate          in   Physical       Education  conducted       by      Haryana          Education      Department      or     an  equivalent         qualification               recognized        by     Haryana  Education Department. The petitioners further pleaded                                             8   that     once       the       criteria          was     laid       down    by      the  Commission,         the       same    was       required       to    be    followed  strictly while making the selection and it was not  proper       to     change         the     criteria.         The      petitioners  pleaded       that          criteria       has       been    changed       by      the  respondent authority to get the desired result and in  order    to       bring      the     candidates         within      the    zone     of  selection in order to grant them undue benefits for  the reasons best known to the respondent authorities.  4.     The    Petitioner           No.1     of       CWP    No.15656       of     2010  pleaded       that      out     of    62    Candidates          who      have     been  appointed         in    district         Yamuna        Nagar,       61    are     less  meritorious            as    compared           to    petitioner         No.1.     The  petitioner         No.1       although           secured     41.68        marks     in  academic qualifications but could get only 8 marks in  the interview. Petitioner further pleaded that all  other    petitioners            secured          good      marks    in     academic  qualifications but they received less marks in viva-  voice due to which they could not be included in the  Select list.                                    9   5.   On an application given under RTI asking for a  copy of the criteria, it was only on 17.06.2010 the  criteria was supplied. The writ petitioners further  pleaded       that    authorities       while        making      selection  neither adopted any rationale criteria nor selected  the candidates on the basis of merit. The criteria  was changed from time to time in order to select some  favourites. Entire selection appears to be a fraud  played    upon       the   general      public.       25      marks      were  mentioned      for    viva-voice       but    when    the       result    was  finalized the candidates were awarded marks more than  25 marks. Paragraph 51 of the W.P.No.15656 of 2010  enumerated      the    main   points         involved      in    the     writ  petition.       “51. That the main law points involved in      the writ petition are: -           i)     Whether    the   respondent    –                 authorities have adopted pick                 and    choose   policy     while                 selecting      the       private                 respondents?           ii)    Whether the marks allocated for                 the   interview   as   per  the                 advertisement could be changed                 subsequently      after     the                 commencement of the selection                 procedure at the whims of the                 respondent authorities?                     10     iii) Whether any rational criteria      was adopted by the respondent –      authorities while awarding the      marks for the viva-voce?  iv)   Whether the marks for the viva-       voice   were  required   to   be       bifurcated under various heads?  v)    Whether the persons who did not       possess   even   the   requisite       educational qualification could       be selected for the post?  vi)   Whether the selection conducted       by the respondent – authorities       is    fair    transparent    and       sustainable in the eyes of law?  vii) Whether    while   making   the      selection Articles 14 and 16 of      the Constitution of India have      been violated?  viii)Whether   the  action  of the      respondent-authorities     is      arbitrary, discriminatory and      unsustainable in the eyes of      law?  ix)   Whether the petitioners should       be allowed to suffer for no       fault on their part especially       when the petitioners possess       better   academic    record   as       compared    to   the    selected       candidates?”                             11   6.    In the writ petition No.15656 of 2010, following  prayers were made:-           “       i.     relevant records    of   the   case   be              summoned;        ii.    to issue a writ in the nature of              Certiorari quashing the selection              list Annexure P-9 dated 10.04.2010              and to issue a writ in the nature of              Mandamus directing the respondent              authorities to select and appoint              the petitioners as PTI’s and it is              further   prayed   that   during   the              pendency of the writ petition the              respondents may kindly be restrained              from    appointing    the     selected              candidates to the posts of PTI’s.       iii.    To issue any other appropriate writ,              order or direction as this Hon’ble              Court may deem fir and proper in the              facts   and   circumstances  of  the              present case;        iv.    To dispense with from filing the              certified copies of the Annexures;        v.     Prior notices to the respondents may              kindly be dispensed with;        vi.    To allow the petitioners to file              photostat copies of the Annexures;       vii.    Costs of the writ petition be              awarded in favour of the petitioners              and against the respondents,                                        12               Any     other order which this Hon’ble                   Court may deem fir may kindly be                   passed.”    7.    The    selected         candidates      were       also     subsequently  impleaded as parties in most of the writ petitions  and   repeated          efforts       were        made     to     serve        them.  Hundreds      of    selected      candidates             were    duly     served.  Written      statements         were        also     filed        by    selected  candidates         in   the    writ    petitions.          The     High        Court  noticed that several respondents have not been served  due   to     various      reasons.          Rest    of     candidates           were  served through substituted service for which public  notice was published in the daily “The Tribune” on  21.03.2012.    8.    A     counter      affidavit          was     also        filed     by    the  Commission opposing the writ petition. Learned Single  Judge had also called for the original record from  the Commission which were produced by the Commission  before the Court.                               13   9.   Learned Single Judge after hearing the counsel  for the parties and after perusing the record allowed  all the writ petitions by judgment and order dated  11.09.2012. Operative portion of the judgment of the  learned Single Judge is as follows: -             “...These writ petitions are thus         allowed. The purported selection made by         the Haryana Staff Selection Commission in         pursuance to the advertisement No.6/2006,         result whereof was published on 11.04.2010         relating to category No.23 for the posts         of PTIs, is hereby quashed. A direction is         issued to the Haryana Staff Selection         Commission to hold a fresh selection, in         accordance with law, within a period of         five months from the date of receipt of         certified copy of this order.             Photocopies of the original noting         files produced in Court as also the         purported criteria laid down by the         Commission dated 03.08.2008 have been got         prepared, kept in a sealed cover and         placed on the records of CWP No.15656 of         2010 to be opened only on Court orders.

LPA No.1594 of 2012 and several other LPAs were  filed     before   the   Division   Bench   challenging   the                                    14   judgment dated 11.09.2012. Apart from LPAs filed by  selected candidates, few of the LPAs were also filed  by some of the writ petitioners they being partly  dissatisfied by the order of the Single Judge as the  issue     of       ineligibility    and      disqualification      of  selected candidates expressly raised by them have not  been gone into by learned Single Judge.    11. The State of Haryana as well as Haryana Staff  Selection Commission had also filed LPA challenging  the judgment of the learned Single Judge. All the  LPAs were heard and decided by the Division Bench  vide    its    judgment    dated        30.09.2013.    The   Division  Bench    upheld      the   order   of     learned     Single   Judge.  Operative      portion of     the judgment       of the      Division  Bench dated 30.09.2013 is as follows: -            “54) For the reasons afore-stated, we         uphold the decision of the learned Single         Judge and consequently: -                 i)    LPA Nos. 1841 and 1903 of 2012                     filed by the Haryana Staff                     Selection    Commission    are                     dismissed    with   cost    of                     Rs.50,000/-    each   to    be                     deposited with the High Court                       15            Legal     Services     Committee          within a period of one month;     ii) LPA No.1562, 1831 to 1839,          1842 to 1855, 1879 to 1902,          1904 to 1917, 1997, 2002, 2028          of 2012; 248 & 262 of 2013          jointly filed by the State of          Haryana and the Haryana Staff          Selection     Commission     are          dismissed with cost of Rs.          10,000/-in each case to be          deposited with the High Court          Legal     Services     Committee          within one month;     iii) LPA Nos. 1555,1557,1592,1594,          1856 to 1860, 1870 to 1878,          1918 to 1920, 1950 of 2012;          529 of 2013 filed by the          selected      candidates     are          dismissed     with    cost    of          Rs.10,000/-     each    to    be          deposited in the High Court          Lawyer Welfare Fund within one          month;     iv) LPA Nos. 1595, 1760,1967,2194          of 2012; and 303 of 2013 filed          by the writ petitioners are          disposed of in the light of          the observations made in para-          53 of this Court;  55) Photostat copies of the four files containing original notings and decisions taken by the Commission or its Chairman from time to time, the decision dated 03.08.2008 have been retained and shall be kept as a part of the judicial record.

These appeals have been filed by the selected  candidates   whose    selection        had   been   set    aside   by  learned   Single Judge      and affirmed          by the   Division  Bench. The State of Haryana as well as Haryana Staff  Selection Commission had also filed Special Leave to  Appeal being SLP(Civil) No. 11143-11210 of 2014 which  was   disposed   of   by   this    Court     by   following     order  dated 30.07.2014: -        “Delay condoned.        The issue arising in this group of special       leave petitions is pending before this       Court in SLP(C) No.35373 of 2013 etc.       filed   at   the    instance  of   selected       candidates. All      the questions   raised       herein would be open to the petitioner       State to be urged in SLP(C) No. 35373 of       2013. In that view of the matter, we do       not consider it necessary to issue formal       notice in these special leave petitions.       Accordingly,     they    are   not    being       entertained. The special leave petitions       are disposed in terms of the above.”   13. While    entertaining     the      SLP   No.35373      of   2013,  Ramjit Singh Kardam and others versus Sanjeev Kumar  and others, and other special leave petitions, this  Court passed following order on 29.11.2013: -        “Issue Notice.                              17         Returnable in three weeks.        Status   Quo,  as   on   today        shall    be       maintained in the meantime.”  14. These appeals were heard on various dates by this  Court.   On   22.01.2020,   this   Court    passed   following  order: -        “Hearing      to       continue         tomorrow       (23.01.2020).        Learned counsel for the State may produce       the original record of selection.”   15.      Further,   when    the    matter    was     heard   on  23.01.2020, learned counsel for the State as well as  Commission produced certain original records on which  date following order was passed: -           “Learned counsel for the State today       placed before this Court an original       tabulation register of the result sheet,       selection list register, interview marks       register of the member as well as of       expert, which indicate that marking have       been done separately. The letter dated       03.08.2008, in original, has also been       placed before the Court, which was also       placed before the High Court.        Heard in part.        List for continuation        of   arguments    on       29.01.2020.                              18        Learned counsel for the State shall      produce rest of the original records on      the next date of hearing i.e. 29.01.2020.”   16. Matter   was   further   heard   by   this   Court   on  29.01.2020 when following order was passed:-          “We have heard learned counsel for the      parties.           Learned counsel appearing for the      Commission has placed before us further      original records i.e. File No.1 containing      correspondence and another original file.      On the earlier occasion learned counsel      for the Commission has produced the      original records which we have noticed in      our order dated 23.01.2020. The register      containing marking by expert member of the      Commission were produced from which it      appears that the expert member has graded      the candidates in A, B and C category      whereas the member of the Commission has      given marks out of 30. On our query as to      whether there was any guidelines to      reflect the evaluation by the Commission      member or how both were to be correlated,      learned counsel for the Commission could      not give any reply.           Learned counsel for the petitioners      has further submitted that in above facts      situation, Commission be directed to file      an affidavit    explaining the    relevant      procedure and the guidelines, if any, with      regard to selection in question and other      selection at the relevant time. With      regard to letter dated 03.08.2008, which      was produced in an envelope on the last      occasion,   learned    counsel   for   the      Commission submitted that the said letter      as well as the proceeding sheets are not                                    19          on the original records which have been        produced today.             Learned counsel for the respondents,        who were writ petitioners, submits that        the State Government may also be directed        to give details of the vacancies, existing        as on date in the relevant PTI Cadre.             We allow two weeks' time to the        learned counsel for the Commission to file        an affidavit giving details as indicated        above after serving the same on the        learned counsel for the petitioners, who        may also file response thereof within a        week thereafter.             List on 26.02.2020.”   17.    In pursuance of the order of this Court dated  29.01.2020,      an   affidavit     dated    11.02.2020      sworn   by  Isha     Kamboz,      Secretary,        Haryana    Staff    Selection  Commission, has been filed.    18. For    the     appellants,     we     have    heard    Shri   Kapil  Sibal, learned senior counsel, Shri V.Giri, learned  senior    counsel,      Shri   Ravindra      Srivastava,      learned  senior counsel, Shri Navneeti Prasad Singh, learned  senior counsel, Shri Rameswar Malik, learned senior  counsel and other learned counsel. Shri Manoj Swarup  has appeared for the respondent writ petitioners. We                                   20   have also heard other counsel appearing for respondent  writ petitioners. Shri A.K. Sinha and other counsels  for   intervenors.     We    have      heard    Shri   Anil   Grover,  Additional Advocate General for State of Haryana as  well as Haryana State Selection Commission.    19. Learned    counsel      for   the    appellants      challenging  the judgment and order of both learned Single Judge  and Division Bench of the High Court submits that  there were no sufficient grounds and materials before  the High Court to set aside the entire selection,  which was held for 1983 posts of PTI. It is submitted  that the respondent writ petitioners have participated  in selection without any demur or protest, hence, they  are   not   entitled   to    challenge         the   selection   after  having been declared unsuccessful. On the principle of  estoppel,    they   are     precluded     from       challenging   the  selection.    20. It is submitted that criteria for selection was  uniformly applied to all the candidates and respondent  writ petitioners having not challenged the criteria of                                   21   selection cannot be allowed to challenge the criteria  after declaration of the select list.    21. It is submitted that there are no allegations of  any mala fide against the Chairman or any member of  the    Commission    or     any   candidate.      The    High     Court  committed error in accepting the grounds of challenge  by    the   writ   petitioners     that   those    candidates       who  secured     good   marks    in    Academics    were      deliberately  given less marks in the viva-voice so that they may go  out of select list. Insofar as not holding of the  written examination it is submitted that there were  grounds for scrapping the written examination which  was held on 01.02.2007.    22. The Commission decided not to hold the written  examination and proceeded to hold the selection on the  basis of criteria which was applied in the earlier  selection     i.e.   2003     selection    i.e.     60    marks     for  Academics and qualification and 30 marks on the Viva-  voice to which no exception can be taken by respondent  writ petitioners. The criteria which was applied in                                       22   the     Selection    was       signed      by    all    members       of    the  Commission on 03.08.2008 to which no exception can be  taken by the respondent writ petitioners.    23. The     Courts     cannot     start         looking    on    the       marks  allocated in Viva-voice nor the same is in the domain  of the Court. The appellants are now over age and  having worked for 10 about years, at this stage, they  cannot be displaced. Increase of marks from 25 to 30  for     viva-voice       was    not     violative         of    any    norms.  Jurisdiction under Article 226 is not an investigative  jurisdiction but it is adjudicatory jurisdiction.    24. Shri       Manoj      Swarup,          learned      senior        counsel  appearing for the respondent writ petitioners submits  that the writ petitioners were unaware of the criteria  which    was   to   be    applied       by      the   Commission       in    the  Selection and they came to know about the criteria of  60 marks for Academics Qualifications and 30 marks for  Interview only by final result dated 10.04.2010 when  it was mentioned in the final result.                                23   25. The Commission could not have held any selection  without declaring the criteria beforehand. The written  examination which was re-notified on 11.06.2008 was  not proceeded with without any valid reason. Written  examination is sure mode of finding out merit in the  candidates and looking to number of the candidates  which was more than 20,000, the Commission has rightly  taken a decision to hold a written test of 200 marks  and interview of 25 marks which ought to have adhered  by the Commission.    26. The Commission never informed the candidates that  no written examination shall be held. The High Court  had summoned the original records and found out from  the original records that those candidates who were  meritorious   as   per   the   qualification   and   academic  marks were deliberately given marks ranging from 7 to  13 so that they may go out of the Select list. Those  candidates who had poor academic records were given  marks in interview ranging from 18 to 28 so that they  may get selected.                                      24   27. The    Commission         after        taking      a        decision    on  30.06.2008    not      to    hold         the   written         examination,  decided to shortlist the candidates for interview on  the basis of marks obtained by them in the academics  and   educational           qualification           and         called     the  candidates 8 times of the number of vacancies. Minimum  marks were also prescribed for candidates to be called  in the interview. The Commission subsequently did not  even adhere to their notification dated 11.07.2008 and  decided to call all eligible candidates for interview  with intend to help those who could not have come in  the criteria of 8 times of the number of vacancies on  the basis of Academic record.    28. The    Commission         from        the   very       beginning       has  proceeded in a manner which indicate that the merit  criteria   was    deliberately            given   up       to    accommodate  favourites.

Civil Appeal @ SLP(C) No. 16837 of 2019   1.    Leave granted.   2.    The challenge in the present appeal is to an order dated 10 th        December, 2018 passed by the learned Single Bench of the High        Court of Judicature at Bombay dismissing the writ petition filed by        the appellant against an order of disqualification under Section 14B                                                                           1         of the Maharashtra Village Panchayats Act, 1959 1 on account of          non-submission of election expenses within the period prescribed.  3.      The election of Gram Panchayat, Mugat, Taluk Mudkhed, District          Nanded were held on 1st November, 2015.               The results were          declared on 4th November, 2015. The appellant was elected as a          Member of Village Panchayat.             The appellant was required to          furnish election expenses within 30 days in the manner prescribed          by the State Election Commission in terms of Section 14B of the          1959 Act.            The appellant submitted expenses with delay of 15          days.      The appellant was served with a show cause notice on 3 rd          March, 2016 as to why she should not be disqualified on account of          failure to submit the election expenses. The appellant submitted          her explanation that due to ill-health there was a delay of 15 days          in furnishing of details of expenses and that delay may be          condoned.   4.      The Collector as a delegate of the State Election Commission          passed an order dated 9th August, 2018 disqualifying the appellant          for a period of five years to be a member of Gram Panchayat only          for the reason that the appellant has not submitted election          expenses within time.  5.      The appeal against such order was dismissed on 19 th November,          2018 by the Additional Divisional Commissioner, Aurangabad for          the reason that the medical certificate is not issued by the          Competent Authority.           The said order was challenged before the   1    for short, ‘1959 Act’                                                                                2      Writ Court wherein the High Court held as under:                  “5. The learned counsel for the petitioner has tendered                 a copy of medical certificate on which petitioner had                 relied upon. The same is taken on record and marked                 “X” for identification. This document has no particulars                 whatsoever, such as name, diagnosis, date and                 reference number etc. There is nothing mentioned.                 This certificate issued by a private hospital bears only a                 stamp of the doctor. It is stated that the petitioner was                 suffering from hypertension, diabetes and was advised                 bed rest. This document, on the face of it, cannot be                 relied upon. If the authorities have not accepted such a                 document, there is no error in the view taken by them.”   6.   Learned counsel for the appellant vehemently argued that the       appellant was advised bed rest on account of hypertension and       diabetes, which fact caused unintended delay of furnishing of       election expenses.        It is also argued that the appellant is duly       elected member of Panchayat and that an order of disqualification       can be passed if the candidate fails to show any good reason or       justification for the failure to submit accounts. It is also submitted       that there is no finding that the accounts furnished, though with       delay of fifteen days, are not proper or not in accordance with       applicable rules or instructions. The order of disqualifying her for       five years, in fact, jeopardises her right to contest election until 8 th       August, 2023 (i.e. from the date of the order passed on 9 th August,       2018).  7.   It   is   argued   that   since   the   appellant    is   a   duly   elected       representative of Village Mugat and has been elected in a       democratic process, the disqualification for a period of five years       without taking into consideration the extent of default and the                                                                                   3      consequences      of   disqualification     renders     the     order   of       disqualification as wholly disproportionate to the deficiency alleged       against the appellant. It is argued that an order of disqualification       should have been passed without delay and not nearly after 3       years of the elections. It is further argued that disqualification for a       period of five years is the maximum period of disqualification       whereas in terms of sub-section (2) of Section 14B of the 1959 Act,       the disqualification can be for a period less than five years.       Therefore, the authority was expected to consider the nature and       extent of default and consequent period of disqualification, which       should be commensurate with the default found by such authority.       The relevant Section 14B of the 1959 Act reads thus:                “14B.  Disqualification          by    State     Election               Commission. –                (1) If the State Election Commission is satisfied that a               person, -                (a) has failed to lodge an account of election expenses               within the time and in the manner required by the State               Election Commission, and                (b) has no good reason or justification for such failure,                the State Election Commission may, by an order               published in the Official Gazette, declare him to be               disqualified and such person shall be disqualified for               being a member of panchayat or for contesting an               election for being a member for a period of five years               from the date of this order.                (2) The State Election Commission may, for reasons to               be recorded, remove any disqualification under sub-               section (1) or reduce the period of any such               disqualification.”  8.   A bare perusal of Section 14B of the 1959 Act shows that the State                                                                               4       Election Commission is to be satisfied as to whether a person has        no good reason or justification for the failure to furnish account of        election expenses. Secondly, in terms of sub-section (2), for the        reasons to be recorded, the disqualification under sub-section (1)        can be removed or the period of disqualification can be reduced.  9.    The Collector passed an order on 9 th August, 2018 not accepting        the explanation for the delayed submission of the election        expenses.   In appeal, learned Additional Divisional Commissioner        found that the medical certificate is not issued by the Competent        Authority and the matter has been verified by the Collector. The        appellant   has   not   submitted   the   election   expenses   within        stipulated time, therefore, there is no error in the order passed by        the Collector. The High Court in the writ petition found that the        medical certificate has no particulars whatsoever such as name,        diagnosis, date and reference number etc. The certificate is issued        by a private hospital and bears only a stamp of doctor.          Such        document was not accepted as reasonable explanation for not        submitting the election expenses within time.        We find that the        explanation in delayed submission of election expenses has not        been accepted.    Therefore, we do not find any reason to take a        different view than the view affirmed by the High Court in the writ        petition filed by the appellant.  10.   However, the question which arises is that whether delay of 15        days necessarily follows the disqualification for a period of five        years. Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the order                                                                              5        of disqualification was passed by the Collector approximately 3         years after the election and there were only two dates of hearing         for more than two years apart.        Therefore, inordinate delay in         pronouncing the disqualification order on the part of the Collector         severely prejudices the appellant as the period of disqualification         starts from the date of the order. However, the learned counsel for         the respondents relies upon judgment of this Court reported as         Union of India & Ors. v. A.K. Pandey2 to contend that the         mandate of Section 14B of the 1959 Act is disqualification and the         word ‘may’ have to be read as ‘shall’.  11.    We do not find any merit in the argument that Section 14B of the         1959 Act is mandatory. Sub-section (1) of Section 14B of the said         Act empowers the State Election Commission to pass an order of         disqualification of a candidate, if the candidate fails to lodge         account of election expenses for lack of good reason or without         any justification. Such satisfaction is required to be recorded by the         Election Commission. The disqualification for a period of five years         is not necessary consequence of merely not filing account of         election expenses. Still further, subsection (2) empowers the State         Election Commission for reasons to be recorded, remove any         disqualification under sub-section (1) or reduce the period of any         such disqualification. Since authority is vested with power to         reduce    the period   of   disqualification,   therefore,   makes   the         provision directory.    2   (2009) 10 SCC 552                                                                                6 12.    This Court in A.K. Pandey held that the prohibitive or negative         words are ordinarily indicative of mandatory nature of the provision         although said fact alone is not conclusive. This Court held as         under:-                   “ 15. The principle seems to be fairly well settled that                   The Court has to examine carefully the purpose of such                   provision and the consequences that may follow from                   non-observance thereof. If the context does not show                   nor demands otherwise, the text of a statutory                   provision couched in a negative form ordinarily has to                   be read in the form of command. When the word “shall”                   is followed by prohibitive or negative words, the                   legislative intention of making the provision absolute,                   peremptory and imperative becomes loud and clear and                   ordinarily has to be inferred as such. ……………….”  13.    In the present case, there is no prohibitive or negative expressions         used in Section 14B of the 1959 Act, as it empowers the Election         Commission to pass a just order of disqualification. Such provision         cannot be treated to be mandatory period of five years in view of         plain language of the Statute.  14.    It is urged by learned counsel for the appellant that the         disqualification is disproportionate to the default committed by         the appellant. In a judgment reported as D. Venkata Reddy v.         R. Sultan & Ors.3, it was held that the election is a politically         sacred public act, not of one person or of one official, but of the         collective will of the whole constituency. The challenge in the said         appeal was to an election on the allegation of corrupt practices.         This Court held that the valuable verdict of the people at the polls         must be given due respect and should not be disregarded on         vague, indefinite, frivolous or fanciful allegations. The onus lies  3   (1976) 2 SCC 455                                                                               7 heavily on the election petitioner to make out a strong case for  setting aside an election. The election results cannot be lightly  brushed aside in election disputes.        At the same time, it is  necessary to protect the purity and sobriety of the elections by  ensuring that the candidates do not secure the valuable votes of  the people by undue influence, fraud, communal propaganda,  bribery or other corrupt practices as laid down in the Act. The  Court held as under:           “3. Mr P. Bassi Reddy learned Counsel for the appellant          has assailed before us the findings of the High Court on          Issues 7, 26 and 27 as these were the only issues which          affected the appellant. Mr B. Shiv Sankar, learned          Counsel for the contesting respondent has endeavoured          to support the judgment of the High Court by          submitting that the findings arrived at by the High Court          were based on a correct and proper appreciation of the          evidence and the facts and circumstances of the record.          In a democracy such as ours, the purity and sanctity of          elections, the sacrosanct and sacred nature of the          electoral process must be preserved and maintained.          The valuable verdict of the people at the polls must be          given due respect and candour and should not be          disregarded or set at naught on vague, indefinite,          frivolous or fanciful allegations or on evidence which is          of a shaky or prevaricating character. It is well settled          that the onus lies heavily on the election petitioner to          make out a strong case for setting aside an election. In          our country election is a fairly costly and expensive          venture and the Representation of the People Act has          provided sufficient safeguards to make the elections fair          and free. In these circumstances, therefore, election          results cannot be lightly brushed aside in election          disputes. At the same time it is necessary to protect the          purity and sobriety of the elections by ensuring that the          candidates do not secure the valuable votes of the          people by undue influence, fraud, communal          propaganda, bribery or other corrupt practices as laid          down in the Act.”                                                                          8 15.    This Court in a judgment reported as State of Punjab v. Baldev         Singh4 held that issue of removal of an elected office bearer has         serious repercussion.         It   implicitly makes it imperative and         obligatory on the part of the authority to have strict adherence to         the statutory provisions. It was held that severer the punishment,         greater care has to be taken to see that all the safeguards provided         in a statute are scrupulously followed.  16.    In Tarlochan Dev Sharma v. State of Punjab & Ors.5, this Court         has held that holding and enjoying an office, discharging related         duties is a valuable statutory right of not only the returned         candidate but also his constituency or electoral college. Therefore,         the procedure prescribed must be strictly adhered to and unless a         clear case is made out, there cannot be any justification for his         removal.  17.    In Ravi Yashwant Bhoir v. District Collector, Raigad & Ors.6,         this Court held that an elected official cannot be permitted to be         removed         unceremoniously    without    following   the    procedure         prescribed by law. Where the statutory provision has very serious         repercussions, it implicitly makes it imperative and obligatory on         the part of the authority to have strict adherence to the statutory         provisions. It was held as under:                    “35. The elected official is accountable to its electorate                   because he is being elected by a large number of                   voters. His removal has serious repercussions as he is                   removed from the post and declared disqualified to                   contest the elections for a further stipulated period, but  4   (1999) 6 SCC 172 5   (2001) 6 SCC 260 6   (2012) 4 SCC 407                                                                                  9                it also takes away the right of the people of his                constituency to be represented by him. Undoubtedly,                the right to hold such a post is statutory and no person                can claim any absolute or vested right to the post, but                he cannot be removed without strictly adhering to the                provisions provided by the legislature for his removal                (vide Jyoti Basu v. Debi Ghosal [(1982) 1 SCC 691 : AIR                1982 SC 983] , Mohan Lal Tripathi v. District Magistrate,                Rae Bareily [(1992) 4 SCC 80 : AIR 1993 SC 2042]                and Ram Beti v. District Panchayat Raj Adhikari [(1998)                1 SCC 680 : AIR 1998 SC 1222] ).                 36. In view of the above, the law on the issue stands                crystallised to the effect that an elected member can be                removed in exceptional circumstances giving strict                adherence to the statutory provisions and holding the                enquiry, meeting the requirement of principles of                natural justice and giving an incumbent an opportunity                to defend himself, for the reason that removal of an                elected person casts stigma upon him and takes away                his valuable statutory right. Not only the elected office-                bearer but his constituency/electoral college is also                deprived of representation by the person of their                choice.                 37. A duly elected person is entitled to hold office for                the term for which he has been elected and he can be                removed only on a proved misconduct or any other                procedure established under law like “no confidence                motion”, etc. The elected official is accountable to its                electorate as he has been elected by a large number of                voters and it would have serious repercussions when he                is removed from the office and further declared                disqualified to contest the election for a further                stipulated period.”   18.   The judgments relate to the procedure to be followed in election        petition and proof of allegation but such principles are to be        followed in the case of inflicting punishment of disqualification,        which has far serious implication almost similar to indulging in        corrupt practices in an election. The purity and transparency in        election process does not give unbridled and arbitrary power to the                                                                               10        Election    Commission     to   pass   any    whimsical    order   without         examining the nature of default. The extent of period of         disqualification has to be in proportion to the default. The Election         Commission has to keep in mind that by such process, an election         of duly elected candidate representing collective will of the voters         of the constituency is being set at naught.  19.    In a judgment reported as Chief Executive Officer, Krishna         District Co-op. Central Bank Ltd. v. K. Hanumantha Rao7, this         Court held that the limited power of judicial review to interfere with         the penalty is based on the doctrine of proportionality which is a         concept of judicial review. If the punishment is so disproportionate         that it shocks the judicial conscience, the court would interfere.         The relevant extract reads as under:                    “7.2 Even otherwise, the aforesaid reason could not be                   a valid reason for interfering with the punishment                   imposed. It is trite that Courts, while exercising their                   power of judicial review over such matters, do not sit as                   the appellate authority. Decision qua the nature and                   quantum is the prerogative of the disciplinary authority.                   It is not the function of the High Court to decide the                   same. It is only in exceptional circumstances, where it is                   found that the punishment/penalty awarded by the                   disciplinary       authority/employer      is     wholly                   disproportionate, that too to an extent that it shakes                   the conscience of the Court, that the Court steps in and                   interferes.                    7.2.1 No doubt, the award of punishment, which is                   grossly in excess to the allegations, cannot claim                   immunity and remains open for interference under                   limited scope for judicial review. This limited power of                   judicial review to interfere with the penalty is based on                   the doctrine of proportionality which is a well-                   recognised concept of judicial review in our                   jurisprudence. The punishment should appear to be so  7   (2017) 2 SCC 528                                                                                 11 disproportionate that it shocks the judicial conscience. [See State of Jharkhand v. Kamal Prasad, (2014) 7 SCC 223]. It would also be apt to extract the following observations in this behalf from the judgment of this Court in Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangthan v. J. Hussain, (2013) 10 SCC 106: (SCC pp. 110-12, paras 8-10)     “8. The order of the appellate authority while    having a relook at the case would, obviously,    examine as to whether the punishment imposed    by the disciplinary authority is reasonable or    not. If the appellate authority is of the opinion    that the case warrants lesser penalty, it can    reduce the penalty so imposed by the    disciplinary authority. Such a power which vests    with the appellate authority departmentally is    ordinarily not available to the Court or a    tribunal. The Court while undertaking judicial    review of the matter is not supposed to    substitute its own opinion on reappraisal of    facts.    (See UT    of    Dadra     and     Nagar    Haveli v. Gulabhia M. Lad, (2010) 5 SCC 775). In    exercise of power of judicial review, however,    the Court can interfere with the punishment    imposed when it is found to be totally irrational    or is outrageous in defiance of logic. This limited    scope of judicial review is permissible and    interference is available only when the    punishment is shockingly disproportionate,    suggesting lack of good faith. Otherwise, merely    because in the opinion of the Court lesser    punishment would have been more appropriate,    cannot be a ground to interfere with the    discretion of the departmental authorities.                xx            xx            xx     10. An imprimatur to the aforesaid principle was    accorded by this Court as well in Ranjit    Thakur v. Union of India, (1987) 4 SCC 611.    Speaking for the Court, Venkatachaliah, J. (as he    then was) emphasising that “all powers have    legal limits” invoked the aforesaid doctrine in    the following words : (SCC p. 620, para 25)         ‘25. … The question of the choice and        quantum of punishment is within the        jurisdiction and discretion of the Court                                                             12                       Martial. But the sentence has to suit the                       offence and the offender. It should not be                       vindictive or unduly harsh. It should not                       be so disproportionate to the offence as                       to shock the conscience and amount in                       itself to conclusive evidence of bias. The                       doctrine of proportionality, as part of the                       concept of judicial review, would ensure                       that even on an aspect which is,                       otherwise, within the exclusive province                       of the Court Martial, if the decision of the                       Court even as to sentence is an                       outrageous defiance of logic, then the                       sentence would not be immune from                       correction. Irrationality and perversity are                       recognised grounds of judicial review.”   20.   The disqualification of a candidate for five years passed under        Section 14B of the 1959 Act leads to disqualification for future        election as well. Though, Section 14B of the 1959 Act empowers        the Commission to disqualify a candidate for a period not        exceeding five years from the date of the order, but to pass an        order of disqualification for five years, which may disqualify him to        contest the next elections as well requires to be supported by        cogent reasons and not merely on the fact of not furnishing of        election expenses. We find that the order of disqualification for a        period of five years is without taking into consideration the extent        of default committed by the appellant and that the will of people is        being interfered with in the wholly perfunctory way. We find that        such mechanical exercise of power without any adequate reasons,        though   required   to   be    recorded,     renders    the    order   of        disqualification for a period of five years as illegal and untenable.        It is abdication of power which is coupled with a duty to impose                                                                                13       just period of disqualification.   Therefore, though the appellant        could be disqualified for a period upto five years, but we find that        such period of disqualification must be supported by tangible        reasons lest it would border on being disproportionate.  21.   Consequently, the order dated 9th August 2018 passed by the        Collector and subsequent orders in appeal and in the writ petition        are set aside in part to the extent of prescribing disqualification for        a period of five years and the matter is remitted to the Collector to        take into consideration the period of delay/default, the purport for        which the election expenses are sought to be furnished and that        the order of disqualification operates from the date of the order        including delay in passing the order of disqualification.          The        Collector shall pass the order afresh in respect of period of        disqualification in accordance with law preferably within a period of        one month from the date of receipt of a copy of this judgment. The        period of disqualification, if any, will be operative from the date of        the order passed earlier by the Collector on 9 th August, 2018 and        any elections held as a consequence of the order of disqualification        will abide the final order to be passed by the Collector.

The present appeals arise out of a common order dated 24 th July,        2019 passed by the learned Single Bench of the High Court of                                                                              14        Judicature at Bombay whereby the writ petition filed by the         appellant Gulabrao Ananda Patil was dismissed and writ petitions         filed by Ritesh Suresh Patil and Pradip Nimba Patil were partly         allowed.  24.    The elections of Panchayat Samiti, Village Mukti, Taluk and District         Dhule, Maharashtra were held on 1 st December, 2013. The         appellant Gulabrao Ananda Patil contested the said elections. The         results were declared on 2nd December, 2013 and the appellant         Gulabrao Ananda Patil was not elected. The appellant was required         to furnish election expenses within 30 days in the manner         prescribed by the State Election Commission in terms of Section         15B of the Maharashtra Zilla Parishads and Panchayat Samitis Act,         19618. Since the appellant did not submit the account of election         expenses within stipulated period, he was served with a show-         cause notice on 21st July, 2014 to explain as to why he should not         be disqualified for next five years on account of his failure to         submit the account of election expenses.     The appellant did not         submit any reply within the prescribed time i.e. within seven days         but on 28th August, 2014, he submitted his explanation that due to         ill-health, he could not furnish the details of expenses.        The         Collector vide order dated 3rd November, 2014 disqualified the         appellant for contesting elections for a period of five years.   An         appeal filed by the appellant was dismissed by the Divisional         Commissioner on 18th December, 2017.  25.    Meanwhile, the elections of Gram Panchayat, Village Mukti were 8   for short, ‘1961 Act’                                                                           15       notified.   The   appellant   submitted   his   nomination   on   21 st        September, 2017 for the post of Sarpanch. Such nomination of the        appellant was objected by Pradip Nimba Patil (Petitioner in W.P. No.        11929 of 2017 before the High Court) but was rejected by the        Returning Officer on 25th September, 2017.        The appellant was        declared elected to the post of Sarpanch.       The Returning Officer        held that the disqualification is applicable only for the elections of        Zilla Parishads and Panchayat Samiti and not for the elections of        Gram Panchayat.        The order of the Returning Officer was        challenged before the High Court in Writ Petition No. 11929 of 2017        and in Writ Petition No. 13711 of 2017.  26.   Writ Petition No. 3846 of 2018 was filed by the appellant Gulabrao        Ananda Patil challenging the order dated 18 th December, 2017        passed by the Divisional Commissioner confirming the order dated        3rd November, 2014 passed by the Collector to disqualify him for a        period of five years on account of his failure to submit account of        election expenses within the stipulated period.     Writ Petition No.        11929 of 2017 was filed by Pradip Nimba Patil challenging the        order dated 25th September, 2017 passed by the Returning Officer        whereby the o"

One Thorat family was the owner of Plot No. 473 in City  Survey No. 1092 at Bhamburda in Pune. By a registered deed of  conveyance dated 21.12.1956 one Mrs. Krishnabai Gopal Rao Thorat  sold the northern part of the plot admeasuring 4910 sq.m. jointly to  Swami Dilip Kumar Roy, one of the most eminent disciples of Sri  Aurobindo, and Smt. Indira Devi, daughter disciple of Swami Dilip  Kumar Roy. The names of Swami Dilip Kumar Roy and Smt. Indira  Devi were duly recorded in the relevant revenue records in 1959.    3.   Swami Dilip Kumar Roy had moved to Pune to propagate the  philosophy of Sri Aurobindo and established the Hare Krishna Mandir  with his daughter disciple Smt. Indira Devi, on the land purchased  from Mrs. Krishnabai Gopal Rao Thorat.    4.   According to the appellants, by an order dated 20.8.1970 of  the Pune Municipal Corporation, Plot No. 473 which was originally  numbered Survey No.1092, was divided. Final plot No. 473 B was  sub divided into 4 plots being plot Nos. 473 B1 comprising an area  of 1025 square meters, 473 B2 comprising an area of 603.00 square  meters, 473 B3 comprising an area of 2838 square meters and 473  B4, a private road admeasuring 414.14 square meters.    5.   Plot No. 473 B1 was owned by Mrs. Kanta Nanda, Plot No. 473  B2 by Mr. Premal Malhotra, and Plot No. 473 B3 by Swami Dilip                                                                       3  Kumar Roy and Smt. Indira Devi.       Plot No. 473 B4, which was a  vacant plot of land, was shown as an Internal Private Road  measuring 444.14 Sq. mtr., in the possession of Swami Dilip Roy and  Smt. Indira Devi and the holders of Plot Nos. 473 B1 and 473 B2,  namely, Mrs. Kanta Nanda and Mr. Premal Malhotra.           It is not in  dispute that the Pune Municipal Corporation was not mentioned in  the order dated 20.8.1970.    6.    On 20.8.1970 the City Survey Officer directed issuance of  separate property cards in view of a proposed Development Scheme  under the Regional and Town Planning Act which included Final Plot  No.473, and an Arbitrator was appointed. The Arbitrator made an  Award dated 16.5.1972 directing that the area and ownership of the  plots were to be as per entries in the property register.    7.    In 1979, the Town Planning Scheme was sanctioned and came  into effect. In ‘B’ Form, Final Plot No.473 was shown to have been  divided into five parts with ownership as follows:-              473 B1: Mrs Kanta Nanda             473 B2: Mr Premal Malhotra             473 B3: Swami Dilipkumar Roy and Sm. Indira Devi             473 B4: Open space owned by Swami Dilipkumar Roy             and Sm. Indira Devi             Unnumbered: Road measuring 444.14 sq.mt owned by             Pune Municipal Corporation                                                                               4  8.      The appellant contends that the Pune Municipal Corporation  by its letters dated 29.6.1996, 4.1.1997 and 18.1.1997 admitted  that the internal road had never been acquired by the Pune  Municipal Corporation.          The Town and Planning Department also  admitted that Pune Minicipal Corpotation had wrongly been shown  to be owner of said road.    9.      By a letter dated 29th June, 1996, the City Survey Officer  informed the Assistant Engineer, Land and Property of the Pune  Municipal Corporation that, as per registered document no. 1429  dated 21.12.1956, Sri Dilip Kumar Roy and Mrs. Indira Devi had  purchased,      Final   Plot    No.   473B     in   Survey   Plot   No.1092   at  Bhamburda, Pune, admeasuring 52,892 sq.f. from Krishnabai Gopal  Rai Thorat. Accordingly as per letter number PTI 2325/12/56 of the  City Architect, separate property card had been opened on 3.9.1959  and the names of the purchasers recorded.    10.     The said letter recorded that as per the office order of the City  Architect dated 20.8.1970, Survey Number 1092B was sub divided  as follows:-        S.No.    C.S. No.        Area (Sq.mtr.)       Name of the Occupier         1      1092 B/1        1025.00              Smt. Kanta Nanda         2.     1092 B/2        603.00               Sri Premal Malhotra         3.     1092 B/3        2838.00              Shri Dilip Kumar Roy                                                     Smt. Indira Devi        4.      1092 B/4        444.00 (Road)        Occupiers of Sr. Nos. 1 to 3                                                                  5  11.   The City Survey Officer pointed out that the names of the  occupiers named above had been confirmed. However, as per Form  I approved in Town Plan No. I, Pune, the name of Pune Municipal  Corporation had been recorded and/or entered incorrectly. The City  Survey Officer recommended initiation of further action, as may be  deemed proper, to consider deletion of the name of the Pune  Municipal Corporation as holder of the road to enable the office of  the City Architect to take further action.    12.   By a letter dated 4.1.1997 written in response to a letter  dated 4.12.1995, the City Deputy Engineer, Construction Control,  Pune Municipal Corporation informed Smt. Indira Devi that the  internal road of final plot number 473B had not come into the  possession of the Pune Municipal Corporation.    13.   By a letter dated 18.1.1997 of the Town Planning and  Valuation Department of the State Government at Pune, the  Assistant Commissioner (Special), Pune Municipal Corporation was  informed that the Government had finally approved Town Planning  Scheme No. I, Pune.       However, in the approved Town Planning  Scheme, Plot No. 473B has been divided into two parts and out of  that final plot number, 473B has been sub-divided into four sub-  plots. A road with the width of 15 feet measuring 414.14 sqm. has  been shown under the ownership of Pune Municipal Corporation.                                                                          6  However, on inspection, it was observed that there was no road in  existence. Final plot number 473B was divided into three plots of  land and one separate plot of land shown as open vacant premises.  A layout was prepared and approved by the City Engineer.    14.    On 12.3.1997, Smt. Indira Devi executed a registered trust  deed constituting the appellant trust and transferred FP 473-B3 and  the internal road to the appellant trust.     The appellant trust wrote a  letter to the State Government requesting the State Government to  correct the wrong entry in the name of Pune Municipal Corporation  in the B Form.    15.    On   25.4.2000,     an   order    number      TPS1697/1271/CR70/  20000/UD-13 was passed by the Urban Development Department,  Government       of   Maharashtra.      The   said   order   is   extracted  hereinbelow for convenience: -        “Whereas, Town Planning Scheme Pune No.1 (First variation)       has been sanctioned by the State Government vide       Notification, Urban Development Department No. TPS       1879/1064/UD-7 dated 5.7.1979 and the same has come       into force with effect from 15.8.1979 (hereinafter referred to       as “the said Scheme’).               And whereas, in the said Scheme Final Plot No. 473B       has been subdivided as 473B-1, 473B-2, 473B-3 473B-4 and       internal layout road (area 444.14 sqmtr.) (hereinafter       referred to as “the said road”).               And whereas the owner of the final plot no. 473B-2       and 473B-3 has requested Government to direct the Pune       Municipal Corporation (hereinafter referred to as “the said       Corporation”) to vary the said Scheme to delete the said                                                                        7        road and include the area in adjacent Final Plot No. 473B-2       to 473B-4 as per site conditions.               And whereas, the Director to Town Planning vide his       letter No. TPS No.I/FP 473B/Shivajinagar/TPV-I/10420 dated       20.3.98 also informed that as per site condition it is not       feasible for the said corporation to construct the said road;               And whereas, considering all these facts, the       Government of Mahrashtra is satisfied that it is necessary to       vary the said scheme under Section 91 of the Maharashtra       Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966 (hereinafter referred       to as the “said Act”) to delete the said road and merge the       area in adjacent plots and said variation required to be made       is not of a substantial nature;               Now, therefore, the Government of Maharashtra       hereby directs the said Corporation to undertake the       variation to the said Scheme under sub-section (2) of       Section 91 of the said Act in respect of the following:-       a)      The said Corporation in accordance with provision       contained in Section 91 of the said act shall undertake       variation to the said Scheme to merge the said road area in       Final Plot No. 473B-2 to 473B-4 and effect consequential       changes in the area of these final plot numbers.       b)      The said Corporation shall accordingly prepare and       publish and draft variation as per provision laid down in sub-       section (2) of Section 91 of the said Act.         By order and in the name of the Governor of Maharashtra.”   16.    By a letter dated 23.10.2002, the Additional Municipal  Corporation Commissioner, Pune Municipal Corporation informed the  Secretary,    Urban   Development     Department,     Government       of  Maharashtra that the Town Planning Scheme No. I in respect of Plot  number 473B had been given effect without any change in the  boundaries of the plot.    The plot had been divided into two large  plots, one of which had been further sub-divided.        The area of  ownership of the plot was to be as per entries in the  property register.      In the said letter it has categorically been  stated that it was necessary to confirm the area of final plot number                                                                    8  473B as per Town Planning Scheme No. I (first variation), as decided  by the arbitrator, for initiating action of deleting Pune Municipal  Corporation from Form B in respect of the road which had been  shown in that plot after making sub-division of the said plot, and to  give effect to the Property Card of Pune Municipal Corporation  recording the names of the holders of the final plot. The said letter  dated 23.10.2002 clearly stated that as per division made during  the year 1970, there was no road. However, a road would have to  be provided for approaching the plot of Shri Nanda.    17.   From the said letter dated 23.10.2002, it appears that, as per  Resolution No.117 taken at the General Body meeting of the Pune  Municipal Corporation on 21.5.2001, approval had been given for  necessary action for changes as per Section 93 of the Regional and  Town Planning Act and notice dated 23.8.2001 to that effect  published in the Gazette of Maharashtra.    18.   By a notice dated 8.9.2004, the Municipal Commissioner, Pune  Municipal Corporation invited objections against the proposal for  merging the internal road with the adjoining sub plots 473 B1, B2,  B3 and B4. There does not appear to have been any objection.                                                                        9  19.    Thereafter, by   a Resolution No. 611 dated 23.3.2006, the  Pune Municipal Corporation adopted the following resolution:-        “Perused the letter on the subject of the Hon’ble Municipal       Commissioner       and     taking     into    consideration       recommendation of the Improvement Committee:        After cancelling internal road of Plot No. 473B at Shivaji       Nagar and after declaring the same as No-development       zone no. F.S.I. should be granted in respect of the road       which has been cancelled.       Similarly as shown in the       affidavit of the Plot Holder Applicant in front of the plot of       plot No. 473B-1, approval is being provided to give the       opinion of Municipal Corporation for providing the road       available.”   20.    By a letter dated 5.4.2006, the City Engineer, Pune Municipal  Corporation informed the Municipal Commissioner that the internal  road in plot number 473B as shown in the layout measuring 444.14  sq. meters had been merged and included in adjacent sub plot  number 473 B-2 and accordingly orders had been issued to  implement the decision as per Section 92(2) of the Regional and  Town Planning Act. In pursuance of Resolution number 117 dated  24.6.2001, sanction was being given for making changes as per  Section 91 of the Regional and Town Planning Act.    21.    Thereafter the Municipal Commissioner wrote a letter to the  State Government on 7.4.2006 submitting a proposal for approval of  variation in the Town Planning Scheme under Section 91 of the  Regional and Town Planning Act.                                                                    10  22.    By an order dated 3.5.2006 impugned in the writ petition, the  Urban Development Department, Government of Maharashtra  rejected the proposal for modification of the Scheme under Section  91 with the following observations:-        1.   The proposal had been opposed by the Pune Municipal             Corporation, who is the owner in respect of the land.        2.   Non-compliance of legal requirements in connection             with the proposal.        3.   It could not be assumed that the Trust would grant             permission to the plot holders of 473B for using the             private road of the adjacent society.        4.   It has been considered a basic necessity of the Town             Planning Scheme to have approach road for every plot.        5.   The deletion of the road would mean that the road             would not be available for new plots of land.    23.    The finding that the Pune Municipal Corporation was the  owner of the land is patently contrary to official records and smacks  of patent error. In any case the impugned order is totally vague in  the absence of any whisper of the legal requirements alleged to  have not been complied with.    24.    The observation in the impugned order, that it could not be  assumed that the appellant Trust would grant permission to other                                                                     11  plot holders of Plot No.473B is speculative and conjectural,  overlooking the usage of the vacant land (Plot No.473 B-4) for  several decades as also the statutory records including the Award of  the Arbitrator in terms whereof Plot 473 B4 was shown to be held by  the owners of Plot Nos. 473 B1, 473 B2 and 473 B3. In any case,  none of the owners of the adjacent plots had raised any objection to  the modification. Furthermore, the attention of the authorities had  duly been drawn to the express terms of the will of Sm. Indira Devi  giving the easementary rights to owners of adjacent plots of access  through the plot held by her.       If the Planning Authority felt it  necessary to provide approach roads, it was incumbent upon it to  acquire land in accordance with law, upon payment of compensation  to its owners or alternatively purchase the same by negotiation.    25.   By a letter dated 9.8.2007, the Appellant Trust drew the  attention of the then Chief Minister of Maharashtra to relevant facts  pertaining to the road, and in particular, to the fact that Smt. Indira  Devi had in her will bequeathed to the other plot owners access  through the plot. The appellant Trust requested the Government to  delete the name of Pune Municipal Commissioner wrongly entered in  the property register.                                                                    12  26.    The appellants filed the writ petition being Writ Petition  No.904 of 2008 in the Bombay High Court challenging the said order  dated 3.5.2006. The writ petition has been dismissed by the  judgment and order under appeal.      The High Court found that the  land in question had vested, without any encumbrances, in the Pune  Municipal Corporation at the time of commencement of the Town  Planning Scheme, by virtue of Section 88 of the Regional and Town  Planning Act.    27.   The High Court has apparently misconstrued Section 88,  reading the same in a narrow, pedantic manner in isolation from  other relevant provisions of the Regional and Town Planning Act, as  discussed later in the judgment.    28.   The High Court has failed to address the question of how the  name of Pune Municipal Corporation could all of a sudden be shown  as the owner of the internal road with effect from 4 th March 1986, in  complete disregard of all records.    The High Court has, with the  greatest of respect, failed to apply its mind to relevant facts,  particularly the records of the Pune Municipal Corporation with  regard to property holders, the Arbitrator’s Award dated 16.5.1972  under section 72 of the Regional and Town Planning Act and the  admission of Pune Municipal Corporation that the road did not  belong to it, it was never acquired and that the name of Pune                                                                        13  Municipal Corporation had wrongly been recorded. Rather, the High  Court records that the Respondent authorities have not disputed  facts in their counter affidavit, but only claimed that the land had  vested under Section 88 and that it was not feasible to make  changes in the Scheme.    29.   The finding of the High Court that it was never the case of the  petitioner that the land had not vested, is misconceived. First of all  there does not appear to be any admission of vesting on the part of  the Appellant Trust. In any case land can only vest in accordance  with law. If the land has not vested, a mistaken admission would  make no difference, for there can be no estoppel against the  Constitution of India, or any statute.    30.   Significantly, the High Court has, in its judgment and order  under appeal, duly recorded the submission that Pune Municipal  Corporation had by its Resolution No.611 passed on 23 rd March,  2006 resolved not to claim any right in respect of Final Plot No.B4.    31.   The High Court failed to appreciate that the mere sanctioning  of a Town Planning Scheme would not wipe out a patently erroneous  recording in the scheme. The High Court did not examine how the  road measuring 414.14 square meters could have been allotted to  Pune Municipal Corporation.                                                                     14  32.    Furthermore,    the High Court came to the conclusion that  since any variation had to be in the light of the provisions of Section  91, the same would be applicable to the given case which would  permit only a variation or modification of a minor nature. The High  Court found the deletion of a public road from the Town Planning  Scheme, to be a variation of a substantial nature, which could not  be permitted, since it would be hit by the bar inherent in the  Section.    33.   The condition precedent for variation of a scheme under  Section 91 is an error, irregularity or informality. There can hardly  be any doubt that the Scheme smacks of apparent error, irregularity  and infirmity in so far as it records Pune Municipal Corporation as  the owner of the private road.       A variation of the Scheme by  recording the name of the true owner cannot be a substantial  variation. It is nobody’s case that the road is a public road. The  finding of the High Court that the change of a public road into a  private road was variation of a substantial nature, is ex facie  erroneous and inconsistent with facts as recorded in the judgment  and order itself.    34.   In 1966 the Maharashtra State Legislature enacted the  Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966          (hereinafter  referred to as ‘the Regional and Town Planning Act’) to make                                                                          15  provision for planning and development and use of land in Regions  established for that purpose, and for the constitution of Regional  Planning     Boards   therefor;   to   make   better   provision   for   the  preparation of Development Plans with a view to ensuring that Town  Planning Schemes are made in a proper manner and their execution  is made effective; to provide for the creation of new towns by means  of    Development     Authorities;     to   make   provisions      for   the  compulsory acquisition of land required for public purposes  in respect of the plans; and for purposes connected therewith.    35.    Section 3 of the Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966  empowers the State Government to establish by notification any  area in the State by defining its limits, to be region for the purposes  of the said Act and to name and alter the name of any such region.  Section 4 read with Section 8 of the Regional and Town Planning Act  provides for the constitution of Regional Planning Boards:-        (a) to carry out a survey of the Region, and prepare reports           on the surveys so carried out;        (b) to prepare an existing-land-use map and such other           maps as may be necessary, for the purpose of           preparing a Regional Plan;        (c)   to prepare a Regional Plan;        (d) to perform any other duties or functions as are           supplemental, incidental or consequential to any of the           foregoing duties, or as may be prescribed by           regulations.                                                                        16  36.    Sections 21(1), (2) and (3) of the Regional and Town Planning  Act as it stood at the material time provided:-        “21. Development Plan:- (1) As soon as may be after the       commencement of this Act, but not later than three years       after such commencement, and subject however to the       provisions of this Act, every Planning Authority shall carry       out a survey, prepare an existing land-use map and prepare       a draft development plan for the area within its jurisdiction,       in accordance with the provisions of a Regional plan, where       there is such a plan [publish a notice in the Official Gazette       and in such other manner as may be prescribed stating that       the draft development plan has been prepared] and submit       the plan to the State Government for sanction. The Planning       Authority shall also submit a quarterly Report to the State       Government about the progress made in carrying out the       survey and prepare the plan.        (2) Subject to the provisions of this Act, every Planning       Authority constituted after the commencement of this Act       shall, not later than three years from the date of its       constitution, [declare its intention to prepare a draft       Development plan, prepare such plan and publish a notice       of such preparation in the Official Gazette] and in such other       manner as may be prescribed] and [submit the draft       development plan] to the State Government for sanction.        [(3) On an application made by any Planning Authority, the       State Government may, having regard to the permissible       period specified in the preceding sections, from time to       time, by order in writing and for adequate reasons to be       specified in such order, extend such period.]”   37.    Section 21 provides that a development plan shall generally  indicate the manner in which the use of land in the area of the  Planning Authority shall be regulated and also indicate the manner  in which the development of land therein shall be carried out.                                                                         17  38.    Section 51 of the Regional and Town Planning Act empowers  the Planning Authority to revoke or modify any permission to  develop as per development plan to such extent as appears to be  necessary after giving the person concerned an opportunity of  hearing.    39.    Section 59 of the Regional and Town Planning Act enables a  Planning Authority to prepare Town Planning Schemes for the area  within its jurisdiction, or any part thereof, for the purpose of  implementing proposals for development.            Section 59(b) of the  Regional and Town Planning Act provides that a Town Planning  Scheme might make provisions for the matters specified in the said  Section, which includes, inter alia, proposals for allocating the use of  land   for    residential,   industrial,   commercial,   agricultural   or  recreational purposes, proposals for designation of lands for public  purposes     such   as   schools,    colleges   and   other   educational  institutions, medical and public health institutions, markets, social  welfare and cultural institutions, theaters and places of public  entertainment, transport and communications such as roads,  highways, railways, waterways, canals, airports etc. water supply,  sewage etc.    40.    The Town Planning Scheme might also make provisions, apart  from the matters specified in Section 22, inter alia, relating          to                                                                          18  laying out or re-laying out of land, either vacant or already built  upon, including areas of comprehensive development ; layout of  new streets or roads, construction, diversion, extension, alteration,  improvement and closing up of streets and roads etc; the  construction, alteration and removal of buildings, bridges and other  structures; allotment or reservation of land for open spaces,  gardens, recreation grounds, schools, markets, green-belts, dairies,  transport facilities and public purposes of all kinds; drainage,  including sewerage, surface or sub-soil drainage and sewage  disposal; lighting; water supply; preservation of objects of historical  or national interest or natural beauty, and of buildings used for  religious purposes or other objects.    41.

One Jagdish Raj, husband of respondent No.1 and father of                           respondent No.2, was appointed as a Clerk-cum-Shroff in the appellant-                           Bank, where he continued to work till his unfortunate demise on 15.1.2004.                           He was drawing a gross monthly salary of Rs.16,486.60 at the time of his                           demise. Consequent to his death, the benefits available for the family of Signature Not Verified  Digitally signed by ASHA SUNDRIYAL Date: 2020.01.08                          Jagdish Raj were calculated and sanctioned to the tune of Rs.5,45,872, but 16:11:40 IST Reason:                            on account of deductions for staff housing and vehicle loans, post                                                                                                    1 adjustment, a net payment of Rs.2,99,672 was made to the family, apart  from the grant of a monthly pension of Rs.5,574.12. An issue has been  raised about the amount being paid less to the family of Jagdish Raj, but that  has really not been debated before us.   2.    Late Shri Jagdish Raj was survived by his wife and three minor  children. As it transpires, respondent No.1 was already employed and  earning a salary at the time of the demise of her husband, which information  came to the knowledge of the appellant-Bank, later. The cause for the  present dispute arises from an application made on behalf of the son  (respondent No.2 herein) seeking compassionate employment on account of  demise of Shri Jagdish Raj.       We may add at the threshold that this  application was made on 24.1.2004, on which date the son was a minor.  Needless to say that any such request for compassionate employment had to  be in terms of the prevalent scheme at that time. There has been some  confusion as to the scheme applicable and, thus, this Court directed the  scheme prevalent, on the date of the death, to be placed before this Court for  consideration, as the High Court appears to have dealt with a scheme which  was of a subsequent date. The need for this also arose on account of the  legal position being settled by the judgment of this Court in Canara Bank                                                                               2 & Anr. v. M. Mahesh Kumar,1qua what would be the cut-off date for  application of such scheme. It is trite to emphasise, based on numerous  judicial pronouncements of this Court, that compassionate appointment is  not an alternative to the normal course of appointment, and that there is no  inherent right to seek compassionate appointment. The objective is only to  provide solace and succour to the family in difficult times and, thus, the  relevancy is at that stage of time when the employee passes away. An  aspect examined by this judgment is as to whether a claim for  compassionate employment under a scheme of a particular year could be  decided based on a subsequent scheme that came into force much after the  claim. The answer to this has been emphatically in the negative. It has also  been observed that the grant of family pension and payment of terminal  benefits cannot be treated as a substitute for providing employment  assistance. The crucial aspect is to turn to the scheme itself to consider as to  what are the provisions made in the scheme for such compassionate  appointment.   3.    On the relevant scheme being placed before us, what emerges is that  vide Circular No.56/79, a scheme was brought into force for compassionate  appointment on 4.4.1979. This is the scheme which was applicable on 1(2015) 7 SCC 412                                                                                3 15.1.2004, i.e. on the date of the death of Shri Jagdish Raj. A provision was  made for compassionate appointment, but subject to the terms & conditions  of the scheme. Para 7 of the scheme reads as under:           “7. According to an agreement with the Union, the dependant will          either be paid gratuity as if the deceased employee has served the full          term of service, which will be calculated as per gratuity rules on the          basis of his/her last drawn pay at the time of his/her death or given          the option for appropriate employment for one dependent subject to          the rules framed for appointment under compassionate grounds. It is          therefore, obvious that appointments under compassionate grounds          will be open only to dependents who do not opt for payment of          gratuity for the full term of service of the employee who died while          in service.”             The aforesaid paragraph, thus, makes it clear that either gratuity or  compassionate appointment can be availed of by the dependents. The result  is that if the dependents opted for payment of gratuity for the term of service  of the employee who died while in service, no compassionate appointment  could be granted. The admitted position is that the benefit of gratuity was  availed of by the dependents in the present case.    4.       Another relevant paragraph of the scheme is para 8, which reads as  under:           “8. No person or dependent can claim, as a matter of right,                                                                                4       employment in the Bank under this Scheme and appointments will be       considered purely at the sole discretion of the Bank. The Bank       reserves to itself the right to modify, suspend, or withdraw the       scheme at any time at its sole discretion and the Bank’s decision in       this regard will be final and cannot be called in question.”         The aforesaid paragraph makes the consideration for appointment on  compassionate grounds at the discretion of the Bank, and not as a matter of  right. This really only emphasizes the settled position of law, discussed  aforesaid.   5.    A new Scheme was promulgated on 5.11.1985, but para 4 of the  Scheme clarifies as under:        “the norms prescribed under scheme for appointment in the Bank of a       dependent of a confirmed employee who dies while in service       remains unchanged.”         Thus, though this may be a new Scheme, it, in effect, continued the  older Scheme, and that is the reason the terms of that Scheme applied on the  date of death of Shri Jagdish Raj, on 15.1.2004.   6.    The first communication was addressed by respondent No.1, on  24.1.2004, to the CMD of the appellant-Bank, seeking compassionate  appointment for her son, respondent No.2. The aforesaid arrangement, thus  being applicable even at that time.                                                                            5 7.    A development post the demise, and this application, was a new  Scheme being brought into force through a Board meeting of the appellant-  Bank w.e.f. 27.4.2004, by way of Circular No. PRNL/09/2004-05, in  supersession of the previous Scheme. However, the qualification for such  Scheme was the death of an employee on account of injury sustained while  performing official duty, with a second condition that the monthly income  of the family (including terminal benefits, insurance claims, investments,  etc. as well as pension and spousal income) was less than 60% of the last  drawn gross salary, net of taxes, of the deceased employee and that the  application for such compassionate appointment had to be submitted within  three (3) months from the demise of such deceased employee. There was  also an option to provide ex gratia compensation with the same second  qualification as aforesaid, if such application is made within three (3)  months from the demise of the deceased employee. The Scheme also refers  to a lumpsum compensation, even where this 60% bar is crossed, and for  Clerks like Shri Jagdish Raj, the amount specified is Rs.2 lakh.    8.    The appellant-Bank, thus, in response to the application for  compassionate appointment, sent a communication to respondent No.1,                                                                           6 asking her to submit a fresh application under the new Scheme within a  month, i.e., by 9.8.2004.       The intent, really, was that only cash  compensation could be made available.        This period, for tendering an  application seeking cash compensation, was further extended repeatedly, but  it appears that the respondents did not apply for the same as they appeared  to be only interested in compassionate appointment.    9.    A Circular No. PRNL/72/2005-06 dated 30.8.2005 was issued  whereby the benefit of compassionate appointment was denied to a  dependent of an employee who died in harness.              Thus, only cash  compensation was the benefit which would accrue. The norm of 60%  eligibility criterion was still made applicable and the application had to be  preferred within six (6) months from demise. This Scheme came into force  from 10.8.2005.    10.   Respondent No.1 made available her gross salary declaration of  Rs.15,912 only on 17.2.2006, which crossed the benchmark of 60% and,  thus, the respondents were informed vide letters dated 10.5.2006 and  30.6.2006 that even cash compensation was not available to the family, and  that there could be no question of compassionate appointment.                                                                             7 11.    It is in the aforesaid circumstances that the respondents filed CWP  No.17105/2006 on 27.10.2006, seeking consideration of compassionate  appointment under the 2004 Scheme, upon respondent No.2 attaining age of  majority. Ex gratia benefits, which were held back, were also sought, along  with interest.    12.    The High Court of Punjab & Haryana vide impugned order dated  11.8.2008, granted Rs.2 lakh ex gratia payment, while leaving it open to the  respondents to make an appropriate application regarding any terminal  benefits, if not paid. This Rs.2 lakh benefit is in consonance with the  subsequent Schemes of 2004 and 2005 which had come into force, and  appears to have been so done more out of sympathy than any other factor.    13.    The appellant-Bank aggrieved by this order filed a Special Leave  Petition and interim order of stay was granted on 16.1.2009. Leave was  granted subsequently and the interim order was made absolute.    14.    We have examined the aforesaid factual matrix and the contentions  raised by learned counsel for the parties.                                                                              8 15.   The question of applicability of any subsequent Scheme really does  not apply in view of the judgment of this Court in Canara Bank2. Thus, it  would not be appropriate to examine the case of the respondents in the  context of subsequent Schemes, but only in the context of the Scheme of  4.4.1979, the terms of which continued to be applicable even as per the new  Scheme of 5.11.1985, i.e. the Scheme applicable to the respondents. There  is no provision in this Scheme for any ex gratia payment. The option of  compassionate appointment was available only if the full amount of gratuity  was not taken, something which was done. Thus, having taken the full  amount of gratuity, the option of compassionate appointment really was not  available to the respondents.    16.   We may also notice that though the subsequent Schemes were not  applicable, even if benefit was sought to be given of those Schemes, initial  non-disclosure and subsequent disclosure by respondent No.1, of her  employment and her emoluments would disentitle her under those Schemes,  too. Thus, when the appellant was calling upon the respondents to apply  under the subsequent Schemes, that could have been beneficial to the   2(supra)                                                                            9 respondents only if they were entitled to any of the benefits under that  Scheme. That could not happen because the benchmark provided in those  subsequent Schemes took the emoluments of respondents beyond the  prescribed limit, so as to disentitle them from both, compassionate  employment and ex gratia payment.    17.   We have to keep in mind the basic principles applicable to the cases  of compassionate employment, i.e., succor being provided at the stage of  unfortunate demise, coupled with compassionate employment not being an  alternate method of public employment. If these factors are kept in mind, it  would be noticed that the respondents had the wherewithal at the relevant  stage of time, as per the norms, to deal with the unfortunate situation which  they were faced with. Thus, looked under any Schemes, the respondents  cannot claim benefit, though, as clarified aforesaid, it is only the relevant  Scheme prevalent on the date of demise of the employee, which could have  been considered to be applicable, in view of the judgment of this Court in  Canara Bank3. It is not for the Courts to substitute a Scheme or add or  subtract from the terms thereof in judicial review, as has been recently  emphasized by this Court in State of Himachal Pradesh & Anr. v. Parkash   3(supra)                                                                            10 Chand4.    18.   We may have sympathy with the respondents about the predicament  they faced on the demise of Shri Jagdish Raj, but then sympathy alone  cannot give remedy to the respondents, more so when the relevant benefits  available to the respondents have been granted by the appellant-Bank and  when respondent No.1, herself, was in employment having monthly income  above the benchmark.    19.   We have, thus, no option but to reluctantly set aside the impugned  order and dismiss the writ petition originally filed by the respondents.    20.   The appeal is accordingly allowed, leaving the parties to bear their  own costs.                                                  ...……………………………J.

Leave granted in both the appeals.            2.             These appeals arise out of two orders passed by the High            Court on 11th September, 2019 granting bail to two accused            persons, Vikram Singh@ Vikki (in SLP(Crl.) No.9207/2019)            and Malkhan Singh (in SLP(Crl.) No.9209/2019) arraigned in Signature Not Verified            a criminal case initiated on the basis of a First Information Digitally signed by INDU MARWAH Date: 2020.01.24 17:58:01 IST Reason:               Report dated 7th February 2009. The said report was made by                                2   Prabhakar Tewari, being the appellant (in both the appeals) in  Police Station Jagadishpur in the State of Uttar Pradesh.  3.   The appellant is the son of the deceased victim,  Purushottam Dutt Tiwari. He was assaulted by gunshots on 7 th  February, 2019 at about 4.00 p.m. while returning to his  residence after attending the Court in connection with a case.  In the first appeal (i.e. SLP(Crl.)No.9207 of 2019), the  appellant assails the order granting bail to Vikram Singh @  Vikky by the High Court. In the statement of the appellant  recorded in the evening on the date of occurrence at about  8.40 p.m., five persons have been named as direct assailants.  Said Vikram Singh in the First Information Report has been  named as the person by whom the “incident has been  committed”. In his statement recorded on the next day i.e. 8 th  February, 2019, the appellant had named Vikram Singh as the  person who had conspired to commit the said crime. Vikram  Singh was taken into custody on 19th March 2019. The High                               3   Court, while granting bail to the accused Vikram Singh  recorded the submission of his learned counsel as also that of  the learned A.G.A., who had opposed the prayer for bail, in  the following terms:-           “Learned counsel for the applicant submits          that accused applicant has falsely been          implicated in the present case. It is further          submitted that statement of independent          witness Narendra Dev Upadhyay was          recorded after a span of 52 days and in his          statement, he has categorically stated he has          overheard the applicant planning for the          alleged incident thereby indicating criminal          conspiracy on the part of the applicant.          There is no incriminating evidence against          the applicant on record. It is also submitted          that no recovery has been shown against the          applicant. The accused applicant is          languishing in jail since 19.03.2019. It has          been pointed out that the applicant has          criminal history which has been duly          explained in the rejoinder affidavits. It is          further submitted that there is no possibility          of the applicant of fleeing away from          judicial custody or tampering with the          witnesses. In case the applicant is enlarged          on bail, he shall not misuse the liberty of          bail.                                 4              Learned A.G.A. opposed the prayer for           bail but could not dispute the aforesaid           facts as argued by the learned counsel for           the applicant.”   4.   Learned counsel for the appellant has submitted that the  accused Vikram Singh is involved in at least five other  criminal cases under the same Police Station, Jagdishpur. He  has also brought to our notice the witness statement of one  Narendra Dev Upadhyay. This statement was recorded on 29 th  March 2019. The part of his statement to which our attention  has been drawn by learned counsel for the appellant records  that the said witness saw Vikram Singh standing near National  Highway 56 Flyover on the date of occurrence of the incident  in Warisganj with 6 or 7 accomplices and all of them were  talking about plans of killing the victim.       Learned Counsel for the State of Uttar Pradesh supported  the appellant’s stand.    Mr. C.A. Sundram, learned senior  counsel for the accused contested the present appeal. His main                                5   argument is that the statement of Narendra Dev Upadhyay, on  which reliance was placed by the prosecution and the  appellant was recorded after fifty days from the date of  occurrence of the incident. On the question of granting bail,  Mr. Sundram has argued, such a statement was unreliable. He  has also submitted that even as per the F.I.R. or the witness  statements recorded under Section 161 of the Code of  Criminal Procedure, 1973, his client was not named as having  participated in the act of assault or being present at the place  of occurrence while the assault took place.  5.   We have considered the respective submissions. The  facts highlighted by the appellant are that the case involves  offence under Section 302 read with Sections 120-B/34, 147,  148 and 149 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. The accused has  several criminal cases pending against him and has been  named in the statement forming the basis of the FIR on the  date of occurrence itself. Two individuals, Rahul Tiwari and                                6   Narendra Dev Upadhyay, whose statements have been  recorded under Section 161 of the 1973 Code also refer to  involvement of the accused Vikram Singh.  6.   In the case of Mahipal Vs. Rajesh Kumar @ Polia &  Anr. (Criminal Appeal No.1843 of 2019) decided on 5 th  December, 2019, a coordinate Bench of this Court has  discussed the scope of jurisdiction of the appellate Court in  setting aside an order of granting bail. The two key factors for  interfering with such an order are non-application of mind on  the part of the Court granting bail or the opinion of the Court  in granting bail is not borne out from a prima facie view of the  evidence on record. In the case of Maulana Mohammed  Amir Rashadi vs. State of Uttar Pradesh and Another  [(2012) 2 SCC 382], a two Judge Bench of this Court declined  to interfere with an order of the High Court granting bail to an  accused having considered the factual features of that case.                                7   7.   On considering the submissions of the learned counsel  for the parties. Having regard to the circumstances of this  case, in our opinion, there has been no wrong or improper  exercise of discretion on the part of the High Court in granting  bail to the accused. The factors outlined in the case of  Mahipal (supra) for testing the legality of an order granting  bail are absent in the order impugned. The materials available  do not justify arriving at the conclusion that the order  impugned suffers from non-application of mind or the reason  for granting bail is not borne out from a prima-facie view of  the evidence on record. The offence alleged no doubt is grave  and serious and there are several criminal cases pending  against the accused. These factors by themselves cannot be  the basis for refusal of prayer for bail. The High Court has  exercised its discretion in granting bail to the accused Vikram  Singh upon considering relevant materials. No ex-facie error  in the order has been shown by the appellant which would                                8   establish exercise of such discretion to be improper.     We  accordingly sustain the order of the High Court granting bail.  This appeal is dismissed.  Criminal Appeal No……../2020 (arising out of SLP(Crl) No.9209/2019) 1.   This appeal also has its origin in the same FIR which  forms subject matter of SLP(Crl.) No.9207/2019. The  submissions on the basis of which the accused arraigned in the  same case was granted bail would appear from the following  passage of the order of the High Court:-           “Learned counsel for the applicant          submits that accused applicant has          falsely been implicated in the present          case. It is further submitted that the          alleged incident took place on          07.02.2019        and    statement      of          independent witness Narendra Dev          Upadhyay was recorded after a span of          52 days. It is also submitted that there is          no recovery from the applicant, which          may lead towards his involvement in          the commission of alleged crime. No          specific role has been assigned to the          applicant. The accused applicant is                               9            languishing in jail since 12.03.2019. It          is next submitted that the applicant is          neither a previous convict nor he has          any criminal history. It is further          submitted that there is no possibility of          the applicant of fleeting away from          judicial custody or tampering with the          witnesses. In case the applicant is          enlarged on bail, he shall not misuse the          liberty of bail.          Learned A.G.A. opposed the prayer for          bail but could not dispute the aforesaid          fact as argued by the learned counsel          for the applicant.” 2.   The accused is Malkhan Singh in this appeal. He was  named in the FIR by the appellant Prabhakar Tewari as one of  the five persons who had intercepted the motorcycle on which  the deceased victim was riding, in front of Warisganj Railway  Station (Halt) on the highway. All the five accused persons,  including Malkhan Singh, as per the F.I.R. and majority of the  witness statements, had fired several rounds upon the  deceased victim. The statement of Rahul Tewari recorded on  15th March, 2019, Shubham Tewari recorded on 12 th April,                                10   2019 and Mahipam Mishra recorded on 20th April 2019 giving  description of the offending incident has been relied upon by  the appellant. It is also submitted that there are other criminal  cases pending against him. Learned counsel for the accused-  respondent no.2 has however pointed out the delay in  recording the witness statements. The accused has been in  custody for about seven months. In this case also, we find no  error or impropriety in exercise of discretion by the High  Court in granting bail to the accused Malkhan Singh. The  reason why we come to this conclusion is broadly the same as  in the previous appeal. This appeal is also dismissed and the  order of the High Court is affirmed.                                      ………………………….J.

Leave granted.            2.             These appeals were initially directed against the order dated            25.11.2019 of the Bombay High Court. By the said impugned order Signature Not Verified            the High Court had relegated the appellant before it i.e. respondent Digitally signed by RAJNI MUKHI Date: 2020.03.02 15:59:04 IST Reason:             no. 1 herein to avail the statutory remedy of appeal before the Debt            Recovery Appellate Tribunal (for short ‘the DRAT’).                                                                    2  3.   The short question which arises for determination is whether  the High Court was right in directing that pre­deposit was not  required for entertaining an appeal before the DRAT as mandated  by Section 18 of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial  Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 (for short  ‘SARFAESI Act’).  4.   It is not necessary to set out the facts of the case in detail in  view of the decision which we propose to take. The basic facts are  that the respondent no. 1 stood guarantee and mortgaged its  property for repayment of loan availed by respondent nos. 4 and 5.  The property was put to auction and respondent nos. 2 and 3 who  are the alleged leaseholders in possession of the property are the  highest bidders for a sum of Rs.65.52 crores. The main objection of  the respondent no.1 to the sale is that it is for a low amount and  there is collusion between the officers of the Bank and the auction  purchaser. The petitioner challenged the order of the DRAT dated  11.11.2019 before the High Court and the High Court passed the  following order dated 25.11.2019:          “2. Relegating the Petitioner to the appellate remedy on         account of aforenoted facts and holding that the         Petitioner has an efficacious alternate remedy of appeal         before the learned DRAT where no pre­deposit is         required, the Petition is rejected without making any         observation on the merits of the disputes between the         parties.”                                                                          3  5.   It appears that the successful bidders filed review petitions  before the High Court praying that the High Court could not have  issued directions that no pre­deposit was required.                Vide order  dated 16.12.2019 the High Court dismissed the review petition and  the relevant observations of the High Court are as under:          “7. Suffice it to state that where a proposed sale notice is         questioned with reference to the reserve price fixed and         the argument takes the form of considering valuation         report, such order, if challenged before DRAT, would not         require any pre­deposit being made for the reason under         the impugned order, no decree has been passed or         liability fixed. It would depend on the nature of the order         whether before the appeal there against is entertained,         should a pre­deposit be made.”    6.   Mr. O.P. Gaggar, learned counsel for the appellant submitted  that the order of the High Court is not only against the provisions of  the Act but also against the law laid down by this Court.                Mr.  Dushyant A. Dave, learned senior counsel for the auction  purchasers, respondent nos. 2 and 3, supported the case of the  appellant and submitted that the no appeal on behalf of respondent  no. 1 can lie without complying with the provisions of Section 18 of  the SARFAESI Act which mandates the deposit of 50% or at least  25% of the amount due, as claimed by the secured creditor or  determined by the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT).                On the other  hand, Mr. Vikram Chaudhri, learned senior counsel appearing for  the respondent no.1 urged that the High Court has exercised its                                                                           4  discretionary jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of  India while holding that it is not required to make pre­deposit. He  also submits that the respondent no.1 is not a borrower and finally  submits that the main ground is that since the amount offered by  the highest bidder is below the value of the property, the DRAT is  entitled to entertain the appeal without deposit of any amount. It is  submitted that the value of the property is about Rs.160 crores and  even the value as per the circle rate is about Rs.120 crores, but the  same has been sold for a pittance of Rs.65.52 crores.                 He also  submitted that there is collusion between the employees of the  Bank and the successful bidders.  7.   We may make it clear that we are not going into the merits of  the case in view of the fact that we agree with the High Court that  the matter must be decided by the DRAT. The only issue is whether  the High Court was right in holding that no pre­deposit was  required. We may refer to Section 18 of the SARFAESI Act, which  reads as follows:          “18. Appeal to Appellate Tribunal.—(1) Any person         aggrieved, by any order made by the Debts Recovery         Tribunal under section 17, may prefer an appeal along         with such fee, as may be prescribed to an Appellate         Tribunal within thirty days from the date of receipt of the         order of Debts Recovery Tribunal.            Provided that different fees may be prescribed for filing         an appeal by the borrower or by the person other than         the borrower:                                                                         5                Provided further that no appeal shall be entertained           unless the borrower has deposited with the Appellate           Tribunal fifty per cent. of the amount of debt due from           him, as claimed by the secured creditors or determined           by the Debts Recovery Tribunal, whichever is less:               Provided also that the Appellate Tribunal may, for the           reasons to be recorded in writing, reduce the amount to           not less than twenty­five per cent. of debt referred to in           the second proviso.                       xxx          xxx             xxx”   This Court in the case of Narayan Chandra Ghosh vs. UCO Bank  & Ors.1, held that keeping in view the language of the Section even  if the amount or debt due had not been determined by the DRT, the  appeal could not be entertained by the DRAT without insisting on  pre­deposit. The DRAT, at best could, after recording the reasons,  have reduced the amount to 25% but could not have totally waived  the deposit. This Court also held that the right of appeal conferred  under Section 18(1) is subject to the conditions laid down in the  second proviso therein which postulates that no appeal shall be  entertained unless the borrower has deposited 50% of the amount  of debt due from him as claimed by the secured creditors or  determined by the DRT, whichever is less.                 The third proviso  enables the DRAT, for reasons to be recorded in writing, to reduce  the amount of deposit to not less than 25%.                    The following  observations of this Court are relevant:  1 (2011) 4 SCC 548                                                                         6           “7…Thus, there is an absolute bar to the entertainment          of an appeal under Section 18 of the Act unless the          condition precedent, as stipulated, is fulfilled. Unless the          borrower makes, with the Appellate Tribunal, a pre­          deposit of fifty per cent of the debt due from him or          determined, an appeal under the said provision cannot be          entertained by the Appellate Tribunal. The language of          the said proviso is clear and admits of no ambiguity.”  8.    In view of the law laid down by this Court, we are clearly of the  view that the observation made by the High Court was totally  incorrect.  9.    We are not in agreement with the submission of Mr. Chaudhri  that the High Court has exercised its discretionary powers under  Article 226 of the Constitution. The order of the High Court does  not show any exercise of such discretionary powers but according  to the High Court on an interpretation of the Section, pre­deposit  was not required. We are also not impressed with the argument of  Mr. Chaudhri that his client is not a borrower. A guarantor or a  mortgagor, who has mortgaged its property to secure the repayment  of the loan, stands on the same footing as a borrower and if he  wants to file an appeal, he must comply with the terms of Section  18 of the SARFAESI Act.  10.   Furthermore, we may add that the High Court has no powers  akin to powers vested in this Court under Article 142 of the  Constitution.      The High Court cannot give directions which are  contrary to law.                                                                7  11.   In view of the above discussion, we set aside both the orders  dated 25.11.2019 and 16.12.2019 of the High Court in so far as  they hold that pre­deposit is not required and allow the appeals.  We reiterate that we have not gone into the merits of the  contentions raised by the parties which shall be decided by the  DRAT when it entertains the appeal and is called upon to do so. We  extend the time given to the auction purchasers, respondent nos. 2  and 3 to deposit the balance of the sale amount till 20.03.2020. We  also direct that in case respondent no.1 files an appeal within 30  days of the pronouncement of this order it shall not be rejected on  the ground of limitation.  12.

The respondent raises a claim of entitlement to compassionate                           appointment on account of the demise of his father late Shri Ranglal                           Shrivas, who was working as a Driver in the Tribal Welfare Department,                           Bhind, Madhya Pradesh, since 6.6.1984 till he passed away on                           11.12.2009, i.e., over a period of almost 23 years.                           2.    The claim of the respondent was predicated on the nature of                           employment of his late father, who was initially appointed as a work- Signature Not Verified  Digitally signed by Anita Malhotra Date: 2020.09.29 19:18:25 IST Reason:                           charged employee. On 12.3.1987, he was made permanent and was paid                                                                                                  1 salary at a regular pay-scale. The benefits of revision of pay and  krammonati (promotion) were also extended to him from time to time.  On the demise of late Shri Ranglal Shrivas, he left behind an ailing wife,  a son (i.e., the respondent herein) and three daughters and is stated to  have been the sole breadwinner for his family. The family, thus, faced  undue economic hardship. A Pension Payment Order (‘PPO’) under the  Madhya Pradesh Civil Pension Rules, 1976 was issued in favour of the  family on account of his having worked from 12.3.1987 to 11.12.2009 on  the basis of his last pay-scale and grade pay. In view of the economic  hardship, the respondent filed an application seeking the benefit of  compassionate appointment.  3.    The request of compassionate appointment was, however, rejected  by the third appellant vide order dated 19.8.2010. Reliance was placed on  the Policy in force for compassionate appointment dated 18.8.2008,  issued by the General Administration Department Ministry, Madhya  Pradesh Government. This policy pertains to when a Government servant  dies while in service, and if such an employee is earning a salary from  the work-charge/contingency fund at the time of his/her demise, then  there was no provision for the grant of such appointment. In this behalf,                                                                          2 reliance was placed on Clause 12.1 of the Policy, which provided for a  compassionate grant of Rs.1,00,000/- to the nominated dependent of such  an employee, and in this case, the same was sanctioned to the wife of the  deceased. It would be appropriate to reproduce the relevant clause as  under:           “12. Provisions for work charge/contingency and daily wager          employees           12.1 When employees receiving salary from work          charge/contingency fund and daily wager employee die, they          would not be eligible for the compassionate appointment; however          Rs.1 lakh in one installment in the name of compassionate grant          shall be given to the dependent member of the family nominated          by them. The amount of gratuity shall not be included in it. The          payment of this amount shall be given from the salary head under          the head of work charge/contingency of the concerned          department.”   4.       The respondent, being aggrieved by the aforesaid order dated  19.8.2010, filed WP No. 3542/2012 before the High Court of Madhya  Pradesh, Gwalior Bench.       The Madhya Pradesh (Work Charged and  Contingency Paid Employees) Pension Rules, 1979 (hereinafter referred  to as the ‘Pension Rules’), more specifically Rule 2(c), was relied upon.  This Rule stipulates that any contingency paid employee or work-charged                                                                          3 employee who has completed 15 years or more of service on or after  1.1.1974, as a permanent employee. It would be relevant to reproduce  the definition of work-charged employee and permanent employee as set  out in Rules 2(b) & 2(c) of the Pension Rules as under:        “2. Definitions. — In these rules, unless the context otherwise requires, -       xxxx         xxxx       xxxx        xxxx        xxxx        (b) “Work-Charged employee” means a person employed upon the       actual execution, as distinct from general supervision of a specified       work or upon subordinate supervision of the departmental labour,       store, running and repairs of electrical equipment and machinery in       connection with such work, excluding the daily paid labour and       muster-roll employee employed on the work;        (c) “Permanent employee” means a contingency paid employee or       a work-charged employee who has completed fifteen years of       service or more on or after the 1st January, 1974.”  5.    It is not in dispute that the father of the respondent had completed  more than 15 years of service at the time of his demise and was, thus, a  permanent employee.      Thus, the respondent claimed entitlement to  compassionate appointment being eligible for a Class IV post as per  Policy of 18.8.2008 and sought the quashing of the impugned decision  dated 19.8.2010.   6.    The writ petition was opposed by the appellants on the ground that                                                                           4 the father of the respondent had been appointed on contingency basis as  per requirement of work as a driver. Such appointment was with the  condition that his service may be terminated with one month’s notice and  that his salary would be released from the contingency fund. In this  behalf reliance was placed on his appointment order dated 5.6.1987, but  strangely neither of the parties placed any appointment letter/order on  record. The factum of the wife of the deceased having already received  Rs. 1,00,000/- as relief in terms of the Policy was emphasised.  7.    The writ petition was allowed by the learned Single Judge of the  High Court vide order dated 19.7.2013, relying upon an earlier judgment  dealing with the issue of an employee, who had been serving for more  than 15 years and who was, thus, found to qualify for the status of a  permanent employee. This relied upon order was sustained in a writ  appeal and an SLP against this was also dismissed.1 On the issue of the  applicability of Clause 12.1 of the Policy reproduced hereinabove, it was  opined that the same would apply to such employees who had not  attained permanency, i.e., once an employee becomes permanent under  the Pension Rules, Clause 12.1 was held as inapplicable for  1 Shahjad Khan v. State of Madhya Pradesh & Ors. (WP No. 2731/2010, WA No. 110/2013 and SLP (C) No. 5859/2014)                                                                               5 compassionate appointment.  8.    The fact that the appellants had even granted krammonati to the  late father of the respondent was also taken as the supportive reasoning.  The appellants were directed to consider the case of the respondent for  compassionate appointment in terms thereof. Aggrieved by the same, the  appellants preferred Writ Appeal No. 583/2013, inter alia, on the ground  that the respondent was not entitled to compassionate appointment and he  was not a regular Government employee within the meaning of Rule 2(b)  of the Madhya Pradesh Civil Service Conduct Rules, 1965, which reads  as under:        “2. Definitions. - In these rules, unless the context otherwise       requires,-        xxxx         xxxx        xxxx         xxxx         xxxx        (b) ""Government servant"" means any person appointed to any civil       service or post in connection with the affairs of the State of       Madhya Pradesh.        Explanation. - A Government servant whose services are placed at       the disposal of a company, corporation, organisation or local       authority by the Government shall, for the purpose of these rules,       be deemed to be a Government servant serving under the       Government notwithstanding that his salary is drawn from sources       other than from the Consolidated Fund of the State.”  9.    The emphasis of the appellants was also on the principle that a                                                                        6 compassionate appointment is not an inherent right but a prerogative of  the State, which can only be granted as per the concerned policy  formulated and enforced at the relevant time. Since Clause 12.1 of the  Policy did not provide for compassionate appointment to work-  charge/contingency fund and daily wager employees, the monetary  benefit as admissible therein had already been granted. The difference  between a regular and a permanent employee was emphasised and  additionally, it was pleaded that even the Rs. 1,00,000/- paid had not been  directed to be refunded.   10.   The writ appeal was dismissed by the Division Bench of the High  Court vide impugned order dated 2.1.2014, primarily predicated on the  reasoning that the late father of the respondent was a permanent  employee as per the Pension Rules. Insofar as grant of amount of Rs.  1,00,000/- was concerned, it was directed to be returned to the appellants  in the event of the respondent gaining compassionate appointment.    11.   It appears that the appellants were in the process of filing an SLP  and, thus, on 12.2.2014, appellant No. 3 accepted the respondent’s claim  for compassionate appointment, but subject to the conditions that the                                                                           7 amount of Rs. 1,00,000/- should be returned, that such appointment  would be dependent on the availability of a vacancy/post, that the posting  offered be compulsorily accepted, and lastly, if an SLP/appeal is filed,  then the outcome of the same will be binding. The SLP was filed on  12.7.2014 and after condonation of delay, notice was issued and the  operation of the impugned judgment was stayed vide order dated  6.2.2015. Leave was granted on 12.10.2015 and the interim order was  made absolute. Thus, till date the respondent has not got the benefit of  compassionate appointment.  12.   We have heard the learned counsels for the parties.  13.   In our opinion, the only issue which has to be examined is whether  the late father of the respondent who admittedly was employed as a  work-charged/contingency employee in the Tribal Welfare Department  was entitled to the compassionate appointment as per the existing policy  on the date of his demise.  14.   It is trite to say that there cannot be any inherent right to  compassionate appointment but rather, it is a right based on certain  criteria, especially to provide succor to a needy family. This has to be in  terms of the applicable policy as existing on the date of demise, unless a                                                                           8 subsequent policy is made applicable retrospectively.2  15.    Insofar as providing succor is concerned, unfortunately, since the  demise of the late father of the respondent, 11 years have passed and  really speaking, the aspect of providing succor to the family immediately  does not survive. We have still examined the matter in the conspectus of  the applicable policy. It is not in question that the Policy prevailing was  one    dated    18.8.2008.     Clause     12.1    clearly    proscribes       work-  charge/contingency fund and daily wager employees from compassionate  appointment. The gravamen of the submission of the respondent is based  on the classification of his late father as a permanent employee on  account of having worked for more than 15 years and the consequent  regularisation of his service.  16.    In our view, the aforesaid plea misses the point of distinction  between a work-charged employee, a permanent employee and a regular  employee. The late father of the respondent was undoubtedly a work-  charged employee and it is nobody’s case that he has not been paid out of  work-charged/contingency fund. He attained the status of a permanent  employee on account of having completed 15 years of service, which   2 State of Gujarat & Ors. v. Arvindkumar T. Tiwari & Anr., (2012) 9 SCC 545                                                                                   9 entitled him to certain benefits including pension and krammonati. This  will, however, not ipso facto give him the status of a regular employee.  17.   In the aforesaid behalf, an analogy can be drawn with the Madhya  Pradesh Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Rules, 1963, under  which employees can be classified as permanent, permanent seasonal,  probationers, badlis, apprentices, temporary and fixed-term employment  employees. A work-charged contingency employee can also be classified  under any of the aforementioned categories and under the said Standing  Orders, the classification as permanent can be granted even on the  completion of 6 months service in a clear vacancy.  18.   We are not required to labour much on the aforesaid issue and  really speaking this issue is no more res integra in view of the judgment  of this Court in Ram Naresh Rawat v. Ashwini Ray & Ors.,3 which  opined that a ‘permanent’ classification does not amount to  regularisation. The case dealt with the aforesaid Standing Orders and it  has been observed in paras 24, 26 & 27 as under:        “24. It is, thus, somewhat puzzling as to whether the employee, on       getting the designation of “permanent employee” can be treated as       “regular” employee. This answer does not flow from the reading of       the Standing Orders Act and Rules. In common parlance, normally, 3 (2017) 3 SCC 436                                                                             10       a person who is known as “permanent employee” would be treated       as a regular employee but it does not appear to be exactly that kind       of situation in the instant case when we find that merely after       completing six months' service an employee gets right to be treated       as “permanent employee”. Moreover, this Court has, as would be       noticed now, drawn a distinction between “permanent employee”       and “regular employee”.        xxxx          xxxx          xxxx          xxxx          xxxx        26. From the aforesaid, it follows that though a “permanent       employee” has right to receive pay in the graded pay-scale, at the       same time, he would be getting only minimum of the said pay-       scale with no increments. It is only the regularisation in service       which would entail grant of increments etc. in the pay-scale.        27. In view of the aforesaid, we do not find any substance in the       contentions raised by the petitioners in these contempt petitions.       We are conscious of the fact that in some cases, on earlier       occasions, the State Government while fixing the pay scale,       granted increments as well. However, if some persons are given       the benefit wrongly, that cannot form the basis of claiming the       same relief. It is trite that right to equality under Article 14 is not in       negative terms (See Indian Council of Agricultural Research &       Anr. v. T.K. Suryanarayan & Ors. [(1997) 6 SCC 766]”    19.   The conclusion to be drawn from the aforesaid is that attaining the  status of permanent employee would entitle one only to a minimum of  the pay-scale without any increments. It is this aspect which was sought  to be emphasised by learned counsel for the respondent to contend that                                                                               11 this would not apply, because in the present case, krammonati and  increments were given. However, we may note that in the order dated  7.2.2002 granting the benefit of monetary krammonati to employees,  including the respondent’s father, it was specified that the same would  not affect the posts of such employees.  20.   The moot point, thus, is that having been granted increments, could  a person be said to have reached the status of a regular employee? In  order to answer this question, we may note that while considering this  aspect in the aforesaid judgment, it was specifically opined that even “if  some persons are given the benefit wrongly, that cannot form the basis of  claiming the same relief. It is trite that right to equality under Article 14  is not in the negative terms.” We say so, not with the objective of giving  a licence to the appellants to withdraw any of the benefits, which are  already granted, and we make this unequivocally clear. However, we  cannot at the same time make a conclusion that the status acquired is that  of a regular employee upon having achieved the status of a permanent  employee in service.  21.   Thus, the classification of the late father of the respondent as a  permanent employee, and this distinction between a ‘permanent’ status                                                                            12 and a ‘regular’ status appears to have been lost sight of in the impugned  judgments.    22.   We may also notice the reliance placed by learned counsel for the  respondent on certain other cases where orders similar in nature were  passed by the High Court and an SLP against one of these orders was  dismissed, but then we have already observed that this will not give a  right for perpetuating something which is not permissible in law.    23.   We had the occasion of examining the issue of compassion  appointment in a recent judgment in Indian Bank & Ors. v. Promila &  Anr.4 We may usefully refer to paras 3, 4, & 5 as under:        “3. There has been some confusion as to the scheme applicable       and, thus, this Court directed the scheme prevalent, on the date of       the death, to be placed before this Court for consideration, as the       High Court appears to have dealt with a scheme which was of a       subsequent date. The need for this also arose on account of the       legal position being settled by the judgment of this Court in Canara       Bank & Anr. v. M. Mahesh Kumar, (2015) 7 SCC 412, qua what       would be the cut-off date for application of such scheme.       4. It is trite to emphasise, based on numerous judicial       pronouncements of this Court, that compassionate appointment is       not an alternative to the normal course of appointment, and that  4 (2020) 2 SCC 729                                                                         13       there is no inherent right to seek compassionate appointment. The       objective is only to provide solace and succour to the family in       difficult times and, thus, the relevancy is at that stage of time when       the employee passes away.        5. An aspect examined by this judgment is as to whether a claim       for compassionate employment under a scheme of a particular year       could be decided based on a subsequent scheme that came into       force much after the claim. The answer to this has been       emphatically in the negative. It has also been observed that the       grant of family pension and payment of terminal benefits cannot be       treated as a substitute for providing employment assistance. The       crucial aspect is to turn to the scheme itself to consider as to what       are the provisions made in the scheme for such compassionate       appointment.”   24.   We are, thus, unable to give any relief to the respondent, much as  we would have liked under the circumstances, but are constrained by the  legal position. The family of the late employee has already been paid the  entitlement as per applicable policy.   25.   We may, however, notice a subsequent development arising from  certain additional documents placed on record pertaining to the  amendment to the policy of 18.8.2008 vide Circular dated 29.9.2014. In  terms of this Circular, the compassionate grant amount was increased  from Rs. 1,00,000/- to Rs. 2,00,000/-. Another Circular was issued on                                                                            14 31.8.2016, through which, a decision was taken that the dependents of  deceased     employees      drawing     a    salary      from    the   work-  charged/contingency      fund   would   be    entitled    to    compassionate  appointment, but it was clarified vide Circular dated 21.3.2017 that  pending cases before the date of the 31.8.2016 Circular would be decided  only in terms of the amended Policy dated 29.9.2014. That being the  position, this last Circular also does not come to the aid of the respondent  as it would amount to making the policy retrospectively applicable, while  the Circular says to the contrary.  26.   We, however, are of the view that we can provide some succor to  the respondent in view of the Circular dated 21.3.2017, the relevant  portion of which reads as under:        “2. In this regard, it is clarified that the compassionate appointment       for the employees of Workcharge and Contingency Fund is in force       also w.e.f. 31.08.2016. And the cases pending before this date, will       be decided only in accordance with the directions issued for       compassionate appointment on 29.09.2014, i.e., they will be       eligible only for compassionate grant and not the compassionate       appointment. The proceedings be ensured accordingly.”     27.   The aforesaid Circular records that pending cases will be decided                                                                             15 in accordance with the directions issued for compassionate appointment  on 29.9.2014. The present case is really not a pending case before the  authority, but a pending lis before this Court.  28.   We are, thus, of the view that it would be appropriate to use our  powers under Article 142 of the Constitution of India to do complete  justice between the parties by increasing the amount from Rs. 1,00,000/-  to Rs. 2,00,000/- as aforesaid. We, in fact, adopted a similar approach in  Punjab State Power Corporation Limited & Ors. v. Nirval Singh.5  29.   It appears from the documents on record that possibly a sum of Rs.  1,00,000/- was deposited by the respondent with the State Bank of India  in an interest-bearing deposit in 2016, and the amount would possibly be  lying in the same deposit. This would have been pursuant to the  impugned order.      We, thus, direct that this FDR be released to the  respondent and that this amount, along with interest which would accrue  to the benefit of the respondent, apart from the additional amount of Rs.  1,00,000/-, we have found as payable to the respondent which should be  so paid within a period of two (2) months from today, failing which it  will carry interest @ 12 per cent per annum (simple interest) till the date   5 (2019) 6 SCC 774                                                                          16 of payment.  30.   The appeal is accordingly allowed leaving the parties to bear their  own costs.                                              ...……………………………J.

Kajal was a bright young girl. She used to attend school,           play with her friends and lead a normal life like any other child.           Unfortunately, on 18th October, 2007, while Kajal was travelling           on a tractor with her parents, the tractor was hit by a truck           which was driven rashly.                In the said accident, Kajal suffered           serious injuries resulting in damage to her brain. This has had Signature Not Verified            very serious consequences on her. She was examined at the Post Digitally signed by CHARANJEET KAUR Date: 2020.02.05 16:55:13 IST Reason:            Graduate              Institute   of   Medical    Education   and   Research,                                                       1 Chandigarh (PGI, Chandigarh for short), for assessment of her  disability. According to the said report, because of head injury  Kajal is left with a very low I.Q. and severe weakness in all her  four limbs, suffers from severe hysteria and severe urinary  incontinence. Her disability has been assessed as 100%.  2.   Dr. Chhabra (PW­4), who was one of the members of the  Board which issued the disability certificate (Ex.P6) stated that  as per the assessment her I.Q. is less than 20% of a child of her  age and her social age is only of a 9 month old child. This means  that Kajal while lying on the bed will grow up to be an adult with  all the physical and biological attributes which a woman would  get on attaining adulthood, including menstruation etc., but her  mind will remain of a 9 month old child. Basically, she will not  understand what is happening all around her.  3.   How does one assess compensation in such a case?          No  amount of money can compensate this child for the injuries  suffered by her. She can never be put back in the same position.  However, compensation has to be determined in terms of the  provisions of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (for short the Act). The  Act requires determination of payment of just compensation and                                    2 it is the duty of the court to ensure that she is paid compensation  which is just.  4.   Kajal through her father filed a claim petition, under the  Act. The Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (MACT for short)  awarded Rs.11,08,501/­ and held that since there was violation  of the terms of policy the insurance company would pay the  amount but would be entitled to recover the same from the  owner.     The High Court enhanced the award amount to  Rs.25,78,501/­ under the following heads:            Heads                                   High Court          Age                                     12          Multiplier                              ­          Income (taken to be)                    Rs. 15,000/­          Disability                              100%          Loss of income and permanent            Rs. 2,70,000/­          disability compensation          Pain, suffering loss of amenities       Rs. 3,00,000/­          Attendant charges                       Rs. 3,20,000/­                                                  (Rs.2500 for 44                                                  years)          Future medical expenses                 Rs. 2,00,000/­          Loss of marriage prospects              Rs. 3,00,000/­          Medical                                 Rs. 1,38,501/­          Treatment          Transportation details / special diet   Rs. 50,000/­          Total                                   Rs.25,78,501/­  Aggrieved by the award the claimant is before this Court.  5.   The    principles    with    regard    to   determination     of   just  compensation contemplated under the Act are well settled.                                         3 Injuries cause deprivation to the body which entitles the claimant  to claim damages. The damages may vary according to the gravity  of the injuries sustained by the claimant in an accident. On  account of the injuries, the claimant may suffer consequential  losses such as (i) loss of earning; (ii) expenses on treatment which  may include medical expenses, transportation, special diet,  attendant charges etc., (iii) loss or diminution to the pleasures of  life by loss of a particular part of the body, and (iv) loss of future  earning capacity. Damages can be pecuniary as well as non­  pecuniary, but all have to be assessed in Rupees and Paise.  6.   It is impossible to equate human suffering and personal  deprivation with money. However, this is what the Act enjoins  upon the courts to do. The court has to make a judicious attempt  to award damages, so as to compensate the claimant for the loss  suffered by the victim. On the one hand, the compensation  should not be assessed very conservatively, but on the other  hand, compensation should also not be assessed in so liberal a  fashion so as to make it a bounty to the claimant. The court while  assessing the compensation should have regard to the degree of  deprivation and the loss caused by such deprivation. Such  compensation is what is termed as just compensation.              The                                    4 compensation or damages assessed for personal injuries should  be substantial to compensate the injured for the deprivation  suffered by the injured throughout his/her life. They should not  be just token damages.  7. There are numerous cases where the principles for grant of  compensation have been enunciated. It would be relevant to  quote pertinent observations from a few.  8.       In Phillips v. Western Railway Co.1, Field, J., while  emphasizing that damages must be full and adequate, held thus:                ""You cannot put the plaintiff back again into his original               position, but you must bring your reasonable common               sense to bear, and you must always recollect that this is               the only occasion on which compensation can be given.               The plaintiff can never sue again for it. You have,               therefore, now to give him compensation once and for all.               He has done no wrong, he has suffered a wrong at the               hands of the defendants and you must take care to give               him full fair compensation for that which he has               suffered."" Besides, the Tribunals should always               remember that the measures of damages in all these               cases ""should be such as to enable even a tortfeasor to               say that he had amply atoned for his misadventure"".  9.       In the case of Mediana2, Lord Halsbury held:                ""Of course the whole region of inquiry into damages is               one of extreme difficulty. You very often cannot even lay               down any principle upon which you can give damages;               nevertheless, it is remitted to the jury, or those who               stand in place of the jury, to consider what compensation               in money shall be given for what is a wrongful act. Take               the most familiar and ordinary case: how is anybody to               measure pain and suffering in moneys counted? Nobody  1   (1874) 4 QBD 406 2   [1900] AC 113                                            5               can suggest that you can by any arithmetical calculation               establish what is the exact amount of money which               would represent such a thing as the pain and suffering               which a person has undergone by reason of an accident.               In truth, I think it would be very arguable to say that a               person would be entitled to no damages for such thing.               What manly mind cares about pain and suffering that is               past? But, nevertheless, the law recognizes that as a               topic upon which damages may be given.""   10.      The following observations of Lord Morris in his speech in H.  West & Son Ltd. v. Shephard3, are very pertinent:                ""Money may be awarded so that something tangible may               be procured to replace something else of the like nature               which has been destroyed or lost. But money cannot               renew a physical frame that has been battered and               shattered. All that Judges and courts can do is to award               sums which must be regarded as giving reasonable               compensation. In the process there must be the               endeavour to secure some uniformity in the general               method of approach. By common assent awards must be               reasonable and must be assessed with moderation.               Furthermore, it is eminently desirable that so far as               possible comparable injuries should be compensated by               comparable awards.""   In the same case Lord Devlin observed that the proper approach  to the problem was to adopt a test as to what contemporary  society would deem to be a fair sum, such as would allow the  wrongdoer to ""hold up his head among his neighbours and say  with their approval that he has done the fair thing"", which  should         be     kept   in   mind   by   the   court   in   determining  compensation in personal injury cases.  3   1963 2 WLR 1359                                           6 11.       Lord Denning while speaking for the Court of Appeal in the  case of Ward v. James4, laid down the following three basic  principles to be followed in such like cases:                 ""Firstly, accessibility: In cases of grave injury, where the                body is wrecked or brain destroyed, it is very difficult to                assess a fair compensation in money, so difficult that the                award must basically be a conventional figure, derived                from experience or from awards in comparable cases.                Secondly, uniformity: There should be some measure of                uniformity in awards so that similar decisions may be                given in similar cases; otherwise there will be great                dissatisfaction in the community and much criticism of                the administration of justice. Thirdly, predictability:                Parties should be able to predict with some measure of                accuracy the sum which is likely to be awarded in a                particular case, for by this means cases can be settled                peaceably and not brought to court, a thing very much to                the public good.""   12.       The assessment of damages in personal injury cases raises  great difficulties. It is not easy to convert the physical and  mental loss into monetary terms. There has to be a measure of  calculated guess work and conjecture. An assessment, as best  as can, in the circumstances, should be made.  13.       In McGregor’s Treatise on Damages, 14th Edn., para 1157,  referring to heads of damages in personal injury actions states:                 ""The person physically injured may recover both for his                pecuniary losses and his non­pecuniary losses. Of these                the pecuniary losses themselves comprise two separate                items, viz., the loss of earnings and other gains which the                plaintiff would have made had he not been injured and                the medical and other expenses to which he is put as a  4   (1965) 1 All ER 563                                              7               result of the injury, and the courts have sub­divided the               non­pecuniary losses into three categories, viz., pain and               suffering, loss of amenities of life and loss of expectation               of life."" 14.        In M/s Concord of India Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Nirmala  Devi and others5, this Court held:                ""2….The determination of the quantum must be liberal,               not niggardly since the law values life and limb in a free               country in generous scales.""   15.       In R.D. Hattangadi           v. Pest Control (India) Pvt. Ltd.6,  dealing with the different heads of compensation in injury cases  this Court held thus:                ""9. Broadly speaking, while fixing the amount of               compensation payable to a victim of an accident, the               damages have to be assessed separately as pecuniary               damages and special damages. Pecuniary damages are               those which the victim has actually incurred and which               are capable of being calculated in terms of money;               whereas non­pecuniary damages are those which are               incapable of being assessed by arithmetical calculations.               In order to appreciate two concepts pecuniary damages               may include expenses incurred by the claimant: (i)               medical attendance; (ii) loss of earning of profit up to the               date of trial; (iii) other material loss. So far as non­               pecuniary damages are concerned, they may include:                     (i) damages for mental and physical shock,                     pain and suffering already suffered or likely to                     be suffered in the future; (ii) damages to                     compensate for the loss of amenities of life                     which may include a variety of matters, i.e., on                     account of injury the claimant may not be able                     to walk, run or sit; (iii) damages for loss of                     expectation of life, i.e. on account of injury the                     normal longevity of the person concerned is                     shortened; (iv) inconvenience, hardship,   5   1980 ACJ 55 (SC) 6   (1995) 1 SCC 551                                             8                        discomfort, disappointment, frustration and                        mental stress in life.""  16.       In Raj Kumar v. Ajay Kumar and Others7, this Court laid  down the heads under which compensation is to be awarded for  personal injuries.                ""6. The heads under which compensation is awarded in               personal injury cases are the following:                         Pecuniary damages (Special damages)                        (i)Expenses relating to treatment, hospitalization,                        medicines, transportation, nourishing food, and                        miscellaneous expenditure.                        (ii) Loss of earnings (and other gains) which the                        injured would have made had he not been                        injured, comprising:                            (a) Loss of earning during the period of                        treatment;                            (b) Loss of future earnings on account of                            permanent disability.                        (iii) Future medical expenses.                         Non­pecuniary damages (General damages)                        (iv) Damages for pain, suffering and trauma as a                        consequence of the injuries.                        (v) Loss of amenities (and/or loss of prospects of                        marriage).                        (vi) Loss of expectation of life (shortening of                        normal longevity).                In routine personal injury cases, compensation will be               awarded only under heads (i), (ii) (a) and (iv). It is only in               serious cases of injury, where there is specific medical               evidence corroborating the evidence of the claimant,               that compensation will be granted under any of the               heads (ii)(b), (iii), (v) and (vi) relating to loss of future               earnings on account of permanent disability, future               medical expenses, loss of amenities (and/or loss of               prospects of marriage) and loss of expectation of life.”     7   (2011) 1 SCC 343                                               9 17.   In K. Suresh       v.   New India Assurance Company Ltd.  and Ors.8, this Court held as follows :            “2...There cannot be actual compensation for anguish of           the    heart   or    for    mental  tribulations.      The           quintessentiality lies in the pragmatic computation of the           loss sustained which has to be in the realm of realistic           approximation. Therefore, Section 168 of the Motor           Vehicles Act, 1988 (for brevity ‘the Act’) stipulates that           there should be grant of “just compensation”. Thus, it           becomes a challenge for a court of law to determine “just           compensation” which is neither a bonanza nor a windfall,           and simultaneously, should not be a pittance.”   18.   Applying the aforesaid principles, we now proceed to assess  the compensation.  Expenses relating to treatment, hospitalization, medicines, transportation etc.   19.   The High Court under the two heads of medical treatment  and transport has awarded Rs.1,88,501/­.                 Out of this an  amount of Rs.1,38,501/­ is the actual expense incurred on the  treatment of Kajal.      One must remember that amongst people  who are not Government employees and belong to the poorer  strata of society, bills are not retained. Some of the bills have  been excluded by the courts below only on the ground that the  name of the patient is not written on the bill.               There is no  dispute with regard to the long period of treatment and 8 (2012) 12 SCC 274                                       10 hospitalisation of this young girl. Immediately after the accident  on 18.10.2007, she was admitted at a hospital in Karnal. From  there, she was referred to the PGI, Chandigarh, where she  remained       admitted   from   21.10.2007     till   12.11.2007 and,  thereafter, she was again admitted in the hospital from  12.11.2007 till 08.12.2007. She was in the hospital for almost  51 days, and both Dr. Sameer Aggarwal (PW­3) from the hospital  at    Karnal    and   Dr.   Rajesh    Chhabra      (PW­4),   from   PGI,  Chandigarh, have supported this. Limiting the amount only to  the bills which have been paid in the name of the claimant only,  would not be reasonable.         Therefore, the amount payable for  actual medical expenses is increased from Rs.1,38,501/­ to  Rs.2,00,000/­.        The amount awarded for transportation at  Rs.50,000/­ is reasonable. Therefore, under this head we award  Rs.2,50,000/­.  Loss of earnings  20.   Both the courts below have held that since the girl was a  young child of 12 years only notional income of Rs.15,000/­ per  annum can be taken into consideration. We do not think this is  a proper way of assessing the future loss of income. This young  girl after studying could have worked and would have earned                                       11 much more than Rs.15,000/­ per annum. Each case has to be  decided on its own evidence but taking notional income to be  Rs.15,000/­ per annum is not at all justified. The appellant has  placed before us material to show that the minimum wages  payable to a skilled workman is Rs.4846/­ per month. In our  opinion this would be the minimum amount which she would  have earned on becoming a major. Adding 40% for the future  prospects, it works to be Rs.6784.40/­ per month, i.e.,  81,412.80 per annum. Applying the multiplier of 18 it works out  to Rs.14,65,430.40, which is rounded off to Rs.14,66,000/­  21.   Though the claimant would have been entitled to separate  attendant charges for the period during which she was  hospitalised, we are refraining from awarding the same because  we are going to award her attendant charges for life.              At the  same time, we are clearly of the view that the tortfeasor cannot  take benefit of the gratuitous service rendered by the family  members. When this small girl was taken to PGI, Chandigarh,  or    was   in   her   village,   2­3    family   members   must    have  accompanied her. Even if we are not paying them the attendant  charges they must be paid for loss of their wages and the  amount they would have spent in hospital for food etc. These                                          12 family members left their work in the village to attend to this  little girl in the hospital at Karnal or Chandigarh. In the hospital  the claimant would have had at least two attendants, and taking  the cost of each at Rs.500/­ per day for 51 days, we award her  Rs.51,000/­.   Attendant charges  22.   The attendant charges have been awarded by the High  Court @ Rs.2,500/­ per month for 44 years, which works out to  Rs.13,20,000/­.    Unfortunately, this system is not a proper  system. Multiplier system is used to balance out various factors.  When compensation is awarded in lump sum, various factors are  taken into consideration. When compensation is paid in lump  sum, this Court has always followed the multiplier system. The  multiplier system should be followed not only for determining  the compensation on account of loss of income but also for  determining the attendant charges etc.          This system was  recognised by this Court in Gobald Motor Service Ltd.             v.  R.M.K. Veluswami9.        The multiplier system factors in the  inflation rate, the rate of interest payable on the lump sum   9 AIR 1962 SC 1                                   13 award, the longevity of the claimant, and also other issues such  as the uncertainties of life.        Out of all the various alternative  methods, the multiplier method has been recognised as the most  realistic and reasonable method.               It ensures better justice  between the parties and thus results in award of ‘just  compensation’ within the meaning of the Act.  23.    It would be apposite at this stage to refer to the observation  of Lord Reid in Taylor v. O’Connor10:             ""Damages to make good the loss of dependency over a            period of years must be awarded as a lump sum and that            sum is generally calculated by applying a multiplier to            the amount of one year's dependency. That is a perfectly            good method in the ordinary case but it conceals the fact            that there are two quite separate matters involved, the            present value of the series of future payments, and the            discounting of that present value to allow for the fact that            for one reason or another the person receiving the            damages might never have enjoyed the whole of the            benefit of the dependency. It is quite unnecessary in the            ordinary case to deal with these matters separately.            Judges and counsel have a wealth of experience which is            an adequate guide to the selection of the multiplier and            any expert evidence is rightly discouraged. But in a case            where the facts are special, I think, that these matters            must have separate consideration if even rough justice is            to be done and expert evidence may be valuable or even            almost essential. The special factor in the present case is            the incidence of Income Tax and, it may be, surtax.""  24.    This Court has reaffirmed the multiplier method in various  cases like Municipal Corporation of Delhi                   v. Subhagwati    10 1971 AC 115                                         14 and Ors.11, U.P. State Road Transport Corporation and Ors.  v. Trilok Chandra and Ors.12, Sandeep Khanduja             v. Atul  Dande and Ors.13.           This Court has also recognised that  Schedule II of the Act can be used as a guide for the multiplier to  be applied in each case. Keeping the claimant’s age in mind, the  multiplier in this case should be 18 as opposed to 44 taken by  the High Court.  25.    Having held so, we are clearly of the view that the basic  amount taken for determining attendant charges is very much  on the lower side.       We must remember that this little girl is  severely suffering from incontinence meaning that she does not  have control over her bodily functions like passing urine and  faeces. As she grows older, she will not be able to handle her  periods.       She requires an attendant virtually 24 hours a day.  She requires an attendant who though may not be medically  trained but must be capable of handling a child who is bed  ridden. She would require an attendant who would ensure that  she does not suffer from bed sores.       The claimant has placed  before us a notification of the State of Haryana of the year 2010,   11 1966 ACJ 57 12 (1996) 4 SCC 362 13 (2017) 3 SCC 351                                     15 wherein the wages for skilled labourer is Rs.4846/­ per month.  We, therefore, assess the cost of one attendant at Rs.5,000/­  and she will require two attendants which works out to  Rs.10,000/­ per month, which comes to Rs.1,20,000/­ per  annum, and using the multiplier of 18 it works out to  Rs.21,60,000/­ for attendant charges for her entire life.   This  takes care of all the pecuniary damages.   Pain, Suffering and Loss of Amenities  26.    Coming to the non­pecuniary damages under the head of  pain, suffering, loss of amenities, the High Court has awarded  this girl only Rs.3,00,000/­. In Mallikarjun     v.   Divisional  Manager, The National Insurance Company Limited and  Ors.14, this Court while dealing with the issue of award under  this head held that it should be at least Rs.6,00,000/­, if the  disability is more than 90%.     As far as the present case is  concerned, in addition to the 100% physical disability the young  girl is suffering from severe incontinence, she is suffering from  severe hysteria and above all she is left with a brain of a nine  month old child. This is a case where departure has to be made   14 2013 (10) SCALE 668                                 16 from the normal rule and the pain and suffering suffered by this  child is such that no amount of compensation can compensate.  27.   One factor which must be kept in mind while assessing the  compensation in a case like the present one is that the claim can  be awarded only once. The claimant cannot come back to court  for enhancement of award at a later stage praying that  something extra has been spent.       Therefore, the courts or the  tribunals assessing the compensation in a case of 100%  disability, especially where there is mental disability also, should  take a liberal view of the matter when awarding compensation.  While awarding this amount we are not only taking the physical  disability but also the mental disability and various other  factors. This child will remain bed­ridden for life. Her mental  age will be that of a nine month old child. Effectively, while her  body grows, she will remain a small baby. We are dealing with a  girl who will physically become a woman but will mentally  remain a 9 month old child. This girl will miss out playing with  her friends.   She cannot communicate; she cannot enjoy the  pleasures of life; she cannot even be amused by watching  cartoons or films; she will miss out the fun of childhood, the  excitement of youth; the pleasures of a marital life; she cannot                                   17 have children who she can love let alone grandchildren. She will  have no pleasure. Her’s is a vegetable existence. Therefore, we  feel in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case even  after taking a very conservative view of the matter an amount  payable for the pain and suffering of this child should be at least  Rs.15,00,000/­.  Loss of marriage prospects  28.   The Tribunal has awarded Rs.3,00,000/­ for loss of  marriage prospects.    We see no reason to interfere with this  finding.   Future medical treatment  29.   The claimant has been awarded only Rs.2,00,000/­ under  this head.   This amount is a pittance.      Keeping in view the  nature of her injuries and the fact that she is bed­ridden this  child is bound to suffer from a lot of medical problems. True it  is that there is no evidence in this regard but there can hardly  be such evidence. She may require special mattress which will  have to be changed frequently. In future as this girl grows, she  may face many other medical issues because of the injuries  suffered in the accident.   Keeping in view her young age and                                   18 assuming she would live another 50­60 years, it would not be  unjust to award her Rs.5,00,000/­ for future medical expenses.   How the compensation should be invested?  30.     The tribunal while awarding the compensation had stated  that the amount payable to the share of Kajal would be kept in a  Fixed Deposit till she attains the age of 18 years.                   The High  Court while enhancing the amount of compensation has directed  that the enhanced amount be paid to the appellant within 45  days. This is totally contrary to the guidelines laid down by this  Court in General Manager, Kerala State Road Transport  Corporation, Trivandrum v. Susamma Thomas and Ors.15,  wherein it has been held clearly that the amount payable to the  minors should not be normally released. The guidelines in this  case were as follows :           “17….(i) The Claims Tribunal should, in the case of minors,              invariably order the amount of compensation awarded to              the minor be invested in long term fixed deposits at least              till the date of the minor attaining majority. The expenses              incurred by the guardian or next friend may, however, be              allowed to be withdrawn;         (ii) In the case of illiterate claimants also the Claims Tribunal              should follow the procedure set out in (i) above, but if              lump sum payment is required for effecting purchases of              any movable or immovable property such as, agricultural              implements, rickshaw, etc., to earn a living, the Tribunal              may consider such a request after making sure that the 15 (1994) 2 SCC 176                                          19           amount is actually spent for the purpose and the demand           is not a ruse to withdraw money;      (iii) In the case of semi­literate persons the Tribunal should           ordinarily resort to the procedure set out at (i) above           unless it is satisfied, for reasons to be stated in writing,           that the whole or part of the amount is required for           expanding and existing business or for purchasing some           property as mentioned in (ii) above for earning his           livelihood, in which case the Tribunal will ensure that the           amount is invested for the purpose for which it is           demanded and paid;      (iv) In the case of literate persons also the Tribunal may           resort to the procedure indicated in (i) above, subject to           the relaxation set out in (ii) and (iii) above, if having regard           to the age, fiscal background and strata of society to           which     the    claimant      belongs     and     such    other           considerations, the Tribunal in the larger interest of the           claimant and with a view to ensuring the safety of the           compensation awarded to him thinks it necessary to do           order;      (v) In the case of widows the Claims Tribunal should           invariably follow the procedure set out in (i) above;      (vi) In personal injury cases"

These appeals arise out of the impugned judgment dated                           14.12.2018 passed by the High Court of Gujarat at Ahmedabad                           dismissing    Criminal   Misc. Application   No.2735/2017   thereby                           declining to quash the FIR No.I-194/2016. By the same order, the                           High Court has allowed Criminal Misc. Application No.24588 of                           2017 and quashed the criminal case in C.C.No.367/2016 filed by                           appellant No.3-Hashmukhbhai Ravjibhai Patel against accused                           Yogeshbhai Muljibhai Patel under Section 138 of N.I. Act. Signature Not Verified  Digitally signed by                           3.   Brief facts which led to the filing of these appeals are as MADHU BALA Date: 2020.02.10 16:42:29 IST Reason:                              under:-                                                                                              1       Appellant No.1-Rajeshbhai Muljibhai Patel is the real brother  of   Yogeshbhai   Muljibhai    Patel    who    is    the    accused    in  C.C.No.367/2016 filed under Section 138 of N.I. Act by appellant  No.3-Hashmukhbhai       Ravjibhai   Patel.    Both    appellant    No.1-  Rajeshbhai and his brother Yogeshbhai are stated to be residents of  United Kingdom. In this appeal, appellant No.1-Rajeshbhai is  represented through his Power of Attorney holder-appellant No.2-  Vipulkumar    Hasmukhbhai      Patel.   Respondent-Yogeshbhai          is  represented   through    his   Power    of Attorney        holder-another  respondent-Mahendrakumar Javaharbhai Patel.  4.    On 08.12.2015, appellant No.3-Hasmukhbhai Ravjibhai Patel  filed a criminal case being C.C.No.367/2016 against accused  Yogeshbhai under Section 138 of N.I. Act. The father of appellant  No.1-Rajeshbhai and Yogeshbhai had agricultural lands bearing  Block/Survey Nos.534, 536/1/A, 536/1/B, 538, 539, 540, 541/1, 542  and 543 situated at Village Fofaliya, Ta. Dabhoi, District Vadodara.  In 2010, in order to sell his father’s land, Yogeshbhai called up  appellant No.3 who is also the maternal uncle of Yogeshbhai and  Rajeshbhai. Since appellant No.3 was also planning of buying some  agricultural land from the surplus funds which he has received from  the sale of his agricultural land, he accepted the proposal of                                                                           2 Yogeshbhai. Yogeshbhai who is residing in United Kingdom showed  his intention to come to India for executing the sale deed of his  lands in favour of appellant No.3 and asked to pay the money to  respondent No.2-Mahendrakumar Javaharbhai Patel. Accordingly,  appellant No.3 gave Rs.30,00,000/- each on four days viz.  21.08.2010, 22.08.2010, 26.08.2010 and 28.08.2010 as part  payment, the total amounting to Rs.1,20,00,000/- to respondent  No.2-Mahendrakumar, who issued receipts for the said payments of  amount for and on behalf of accused Yogeshbhai. In 2015, accused  Yogeshbhai came to India and arranged meeting with appellant  No.3. In the meeting, Yogeshbhai informed appellant No.3 that he  has already executed a registered Sale Deed No.1229/2013 dated  16.07.2013 in favour of one M/s Brentwood Industries India Pvt. Ltd.  thereby, selling the above referred lands to that company which was  agreed to be sold to appellant No.3.  5.   Knowing all these facts, appellant No.3 demanded his legal  outstanding debt from Yogeshbhai immediately i.e. total of  Rs.1,20,00,000/- and Yogeshbhai promised to refund the amount by  issuing four cheques each of Rs.30,00,000/- each in favour of  appellant No.3. Accordingly, accused Yogeshbhai issued cheques  bearing Nos.8108 and 8109 of NRO Account No.08540107512 on                                                                      3 12.10.2015 and cheque Nos.20801 and 20802 of NRE Account  No.085401000566 on 30.10.2015. As per appellant No.3, at the  time of issuance of cheques, Yogeshbhai gave assurance of the  clearance of above cheques.  6.   Two cheques bearing Nos.8108 and 8109 dated 12.10.2015  of NRO Account No.08540107512 amounting to Rs.30,00,000/-  each were dishonoured on the same day i.e. on 12.10.2015 on the  ground of “Payment stopped by the Drawer”. The third cheque was  of         NRE Account No.085401000566 with cheque bearing  No.20801 dated 30.10.2015 amounting to Rs.30,00,000/- and the  fourth cheque was also of NRE Account No.085401000566 with  cheque   bearing   No.20802   dated   30.10.2015   amounting   to  Rs.30,00,000/-. When those two cheques drawn on NRE Account  No.085401000566 were presented before the Bank on the same  day i.e. on 30.10.2015, those cheques were also returned on the  same day with the endorsement “Payment stopped by the Drawer”.  Thereafter, appellant No.3 sent a legal notice to Yogeshbhai on  17.11.2015 demanding payment of money which notice was  delivered on 23.11.2015.  7.   Insofar as dishonor of cheques bearing Nos.8108 and 8109  dated 12.10.2015 of NRO Account No.08540107512, they were                                                                  4 returned unpaid on 12.10.2015. The Complainant issued notice on  17.11.2015 and therefore, claim qua the two cheque Nos.8108 and  8109 are barred by limitation under the provisions of Negotiable  Instruments Act. The complaint therefore, pertains only for cheque  Nos.20801 and 20802 of NRE Account No.085401000566 which  were returned unpaid on 30.10.2015. Complaint under Section 138  of N.I. Act against Yogeshbhai was taken on file on 05.02.2016 in  C.C.No.367/2016. On 06.09.2016, the Court of 5 th Additional Civil  Judge & JMFC, Bharuch issued a bailable warrant for production of  accused Yogeshbhai.  8.   Appellant No.3-Hasmukhbhai has filed a Special Summary  Suit No.105/2015 before the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate,  Vadodara for recovery of Rs.1,20,00,000/- under Order 37 of CPC.  Summary Suit No.105/2015 filed by appellant No.3 was based on  the four receipts issued by respondent No.2-Mahendrakumar. The  Court in that case has issued summons for appearance against  Yogeshbhai and Mahendrakumar which has been served on  01.11.2015. According to the respondents, they came to know  about those four receipts only after they have been served with  summons in the said suit. Alleging that the appellants have forged  and fabricated the four receipts, respondent No.2-Mahendrakumar                                                                    5 has filed the complaint for cheating and forgery against the  appellants. Based on the said complaint, FIR No.I-194/2016 was  registered against the appellants under Sections 406, 420, 465,  467, 468, 471 and 114 IPC. Respondent No.2-Mahendrakumar has  alleged that the appellants joined together and prepared fabricated  receipts of Rs.1,20,00,000/- bearing forged signature of respondent  No.2 and produced these forged receipts as true.  9.   In the FIR, it was averred that Yogeshbhai, who is residing in  United Kingdom had executed a power of attorney dated  14.03.2013 in favour of Mahendrakumar for administration of his  lands. On the basis of this power of attorney, Mahendrakumar  executed an Agreement to Sale in favour of one Jigneshbhai  Dhanesh Chandra Shah on 16.04.2013. Thereafter, Yogeshbhai  came from London and executed a registered Sale Deed  No.1229/2013 dated 16.07.2013 in favour of M/s Brentwood  Industries India Pvt. Ltd. for Rs.6,16,44,000/-. In the sale deed, the  agreement to sale holder has signed as confirming party. In  consideration of the sale deed, the land owner was to receive  Rs.6,16,44,000/- and the confirming party-Jigneshbhai was to  receive Rs.1,13,94,000/-. Yogeshbhai is the elder brother of  appellant No.1-Rajeshbhai. Appellant No.1 had filed a Special Civil                                                                        6 Suit No.284/2013 before the Court of Principal Civil Judge, Bharuch  claiming his share in the said land sold by Yogeshbhai. In the said  suit, Yogeshbhai, his mother Kanchanben, respondent No.2-  Mahendrakumar and Jigneshbhai were arraigned as defendants.  The said suit was compromised between appellant No.1 and  Yogeshbhai in London and Yogeshbhai was to pay Rs.90,00,000/-  to Rajeshbhai-appellant No.1. Appellant No.1 agreed to issue NOC  and promised that his power of attorney holder-appellant No.2-  Vipulkumar Hasmukhbhai Patel will issue NOC. Accordingly,  Yogeshbhai had come from London and his power of attorney  holder-appellant No.2-Vipulkumar had executed NOC letter in  presence of Notary H.J. Zala on 23.09.2015. There was various  correspondence    between     the   parties   and   the   company  M/s Brentwood Industries India Pvt. Ltd. regarding payment of said  Rs.90,00,000/-.  10.   Appellants No.1 to 3 filed Criminal Misc. Application  No.2735/2017 before the High Court under Section 482 Cr.P.C. for  quashing of FIR No.I-194/2016. Yogeshbhai who is the accused in  the criminal case being C.C.No.367/2016 also filed Criminal Misc.  Application No.24588/2017 for quashing of cheque case filed  against him under Section 138 of N.I. Act. Yogeshbhai claimed that                                                                     7 he has given the cheques to appellant No.3-Hasmukhbhai who  approached him requesting for help to purchase land. Yogeshbhai  alleged that the appellants have forged the receipts issued by  respondent No.2-Mahendrakumar. In this regard, Yogeshbhai  placed reliance upon the report of the hand-writing expert,  Directorate of Forensic Science dated 15.12.2016 as per which, the  disputed signatures of Mahendrakumar Javaharbhai on the receipts  were not written by him i.e. respondent No.2-Mahendrakumar  Javaharbhai.  11.   Vide the impugned judgment dated 14.12.2018, the High  Court dismissed Criminal Misc. Application No.2735/2017 and  declined to quash the FIR No.I-194/2016. The High Court held that  on the basis of four receipts allegedly issued by Mahendrakumar,  the third appellant-Hasmukhbhai has filed the Summary Suit  No.105/2015 for recovery of Rs.1,20,00,000/-. The High Court  referred to the hand-writing expert’s opinion who has opined that the  signatures found in the receipts do not tally with the signature of  respondent No.2-Mahendrakumar. The High Court held that looking  into the allegations and the facts, prima facie case of forgery and  cheating are made out against the appellants and accordingly,                                                                         8 declined to quash the FIR No.I-194/2016 and dismissed Criminal  Misc. Application No.2735/2017.  12.   On the basis of order passed in Criminal Misc. Application  No.2735/2017, the Criminal Misc. Application No.24588/2017 filed  by    Yogeshbhai   was      allowed   and   the   criminal   case   in  C.C.No.367/2016 filed by appellant No.3-Hasmukhbhai under  Section 138 of N.I. Act was quashed. The High Court held that  based on the alleged forged receipts, criminal case has been filed  under Section 138 of N.I. Act and the cheque case cannot be  proceeded with and accordingly, quashed the criminal case in  C.C.No.367/2016 filed under Section 138 of N.I. Act.           Being  aggrieved, the appellants have filed these appeals.  13.   Mr. D.N. Parikh, learned counsel for the appellants has  submitted that the High Court has failed to appreciate that the FIR  lodged by respondent No.2-Mahendrakumar is false and frivolous  as the same subject matter is pending consideration in Summary  Suit No.105/2015. It was submitted that at least two cases viz.  Special   Summary    Suit    No.105/2015    and   criminal   case   in  C.C.No.367/2016 filed under Section 138 of N.I. Act are pending  before the competent court and while so, the criminal case could not  have been registered on the four receipts which are the subject                                                                       9 matter of the pending litigations between the parties. It was further  submitted that in the Summary Suit No.105/2015, issue No.5  framed by the Court is “whether the defendant proved that the  plaintiff has fabricated the forged signature illegally and created  forged receipts” and the FSL report-report of the handwriting expert  is filed in the said suit and the Civil Court is yet to determine the  issue as to the genuineness of the receipts. Learned counsel  submitted that the High Court has failed to appreciate that the  opinion of the handwriting expert is relevant evidence, but it is not a  conclusive evidence and Section 73 of the Indian Evidence Act  empowers the Court to compare the admitted and disputed writings  for the purpose of forming Court’s opinion. It was contended that  when the genuineness of four receipts is an issue in the civil suit  and the dispute is of civil nature, the continuation of the criminal  case is an abuse of process of the Court and the             FIR No.I-  194/2016 is liable to be quashed. It was also contended that the  High Court erred in quashing the cheque case filed under Section  138 of N.I. Act and the High Court did not keep in view that  issuance of cheques by Yogeshbhai from his NRE Account has  been admitted.                                                                         10 14.   Refuting the above contentions, Ms. Aishwarya Bhati, learned  Senior counsel for the respondents has submitted that appellant  No.3-Hashmukhbhai is the maternal uncle of Yogeshbhai and  relying upon the words of appellant No.3 and his son-appellant  No.2-Vipulkumar,    Yogeshbhai    issued   two    cheques    bearing  Nos.8108 and 8109 for Rs.30,00,000/- each from his NRO Account  and after issuing the cheques, Yogeshbhai realised that there was  no funds in the said account and he asked appellant No.3 to return  the above cheques and collect new cheques of another account. It  was submitted that thereafter Yogeshbhai issued new cheques of  NRE Account bearing Nos.20801 and 20802 of Rs.30,00,000/- each  and at that time, appellant No.3 had told that he had not brought the  old cheques with him and will return the old cheques in a day or two  but never returned the cheques. Learned Senior counsel submitted  that Yogeshbhai got suspicious and on making enquiry, he found  that appellants No.2 and 3 were not intending to purchase any  lands and thus, he has instructed the Bank to stop payment for all  the four cheques. Learned Senior counsel further submitted that  appellants made four forged receipts of Rs.30,00,000/- each by  forging the signatures of respondent No.2-Mahendrakumar and the  handwriting expert opined that four receipts relied upon by appellant  No.3-Hasmukhbhai have not been signed by respondent No.2-                                                                    11 Mahendrakumar and on the basis of FSL report, FIR No.I-194/2016  has been registered under Sections 406, 420, 465, 467, 468, 471  and 114 IPC. It was submitted that since there is a prima facie case  of forgery and cheating made out against the appellants, the High  Court rightly declined to quash the FIR and the impugned order  warrants no interference.  15.   We have carefully considered the submissions and perused  the impugned order and other materials on record.  16.   The issue relates to the alleged forgery of four receipts dated  21.08.2010, 22.08.2010, 26.08.2010 and 28.08.2010 each for a  sum of Rs.30,00,000/- totalling to Rs.1,20,00,000/- issued by  respondent No.2-Mahendrakumar. For the recovery of the amount  of Rs.1,20,00,000/-, appellant No.3-Hasmukhbhai filed Special  Summary Suit No.105/2015 in October, 2015. After receiving  summons in Summary Suit No.105/2015, respondent No.2-  Mahendrakumar entered appearance and filed application seeking  leave to defend and the said application was allowed on  19.04.2016. On application filed by appellant No.3-Hasmukhbhai in  the Summary Suit No.105/2015, four receipts were sent to Forensic  Science Laboratory for obtaining the opinion of handwriting expert.  The handwriting expert’s report was received in the Court on                                                                     12 15.12.2016 to the effect that all the four receipts were not signed by  respondent        No.2-Mahendrakumar.         It   was     thereafter    on    the  complaint filed by respondent No.2, FIR No.I-194/2016 dated  28.12.2016 was registered against the appellants for the offences  punishable under Sections 406, 420, 465, 467, 468, 471 and 114  IPC.  17.    In C.C.No.367/2016, case of appellant No.3-Hasmukhbhai is  that Yogeshbhai issued four cheques each for a sum of  Rs.30,00,000/-, details of which are as under:-    S.No.      Date      Cheque       Account              Amount         Date of                        No.                                             Dishonour   1.      12.10.2015   8108     NRO      Account   Rs.30,00,000/-     12.10.2015                                 No.08540107512   2.      12.10.2015   8109     NRO      Account   Rs.30,00,000/-     12.10.2015                                 No.08540107512   3.      30.10.2015   20801    NRE      Account   Rs.30,00,000/-     30.10.2015                                 No.085401000566   4.      30.10.2015   20802    NRE      Account   Rs.30,00,000/-     30.10.2015                                 No.085401000566           Total                                    Rs.1,20,00,000/-    On presentation, the above cheques were dishonoured on the  ground “Payment stopped by the Drawer”. After issuing the legal  notice,   appellant     No.3-Hasmukhbhai           filed   criminal     case       in  C.C.No.367/2016 on 08.12.2015 pertaining to two cheques bearing  Nos.20801 and 20802. It was only thereafter, respondent No.2-  Mahendrakumar had filed the criminal complaint dated 20.03.2016  and also filed another criminal complaint dated 14.04.2016 against                                                                                      13 appellant No.1-Rajeshbhai and appellant No.2-Vipulkumar. Since  the police had not registered the FIR, respondent No.2 filed SCRA  No.5945/2016 and SCRA No.6349/2016 before the High Court for  seeking directions for lodging FIR. The High Court vide orders dated  04.10.2016 and 06.09.2016 disposed of those petitions directing the  police to investigate into the matter.  18.   Be that as it may, in the Summary Suit No.105/2015, leave to  defend was granted to respondent No.2-Mahendrakumar on  19.04.2016. On the application filed by appellant No.3 in the said  Summary Suit No.105/2015, four receipts filed in the suit were sent  to the handwriting expert. The handwriting expert has opined that  signatures in all the four receipts did not tally with the sample  signatures which were of respondent No.2-Mahendrakumar. It was  only thereafter, complaint was filed by Mahendrakumar, based on  which, FIR No.I-194/2016 was registered on 28.12.2016 against the  appellants for the offences punishable under Sections 406, 420,  465, 467, 468, 471 and 114 IPC. As rightly contended by the  learned counsel for the appellants, in the          Summary Suit  No.105/2015, issue No.5 has been framed by the Court “whether  the defendant proved that the plaintiff has fabricated the forged  signature illegally and created forged receipts”. When the issue as                                                                     14 to the genuineness of the receipts is pending consideration in the  civil suit, in our view, the FIR ought not to have been allowed to  continue as it would prejudice the interest of the parties and the  stand taken by them in the civil suit.  19.   It is also to be pointed out that in terms of Section 45 of the  Indian Evidence Act, the opinion of handwriting expert is a relevant  piece of evidence; but it is not a conclusive evidence. It is always  open to the plaintiff-appellant No.3 to adduce appropriate evidence  to disprove the opinion of the handwriting expert. That apart,  Section 73 of the Indian Evidence Act empowers the Court to  compare the admitted and disputed writings for the purpose of  forming its own opinion. Based on the sole opinion of the  handwriting expert, the       FIR ought not to have been registered.  Continuation of                          FIR No.I-194/2016, in our view,  would amount to abuse of the process of Court and the petition filed  by the appellants under Section 482 Crl.P.C. in Criminal Misc.  Application No.2735/2017 to quash the FIR I-194/2016 is to be  allowed.  20.   The High Court, in our view, erred in quashing the criminal  case in C.C.No.367/2016 filed by appellant No.3-Hasmukhbhai  under Section 138 of N.I. Act. As pointed out earlier, Yogeshbhai                                                                         15 has admitted the issuance of cheques. When once the issuance of  cheque is admitted/established, the presumption would arise under  Section 139 of the N.I. Act in favour of the holder of cheque that is  the complainant-appellant No.3. The nature of presumptions under  Section139 of the N.I. Act and Section 118(a) of the Indian  Evidence Act are rebuttable. Yogeshbhai has of course, raised the  defence that there is no illegally enforceable debt and he issued the  cheques to help appellant No.3-Hasmukhbhai for purchase of lands.  The burden lies upon the accused to rebut the presumption by  adducing evidence. The High Court did not keep in view that until  the accused discharges his burden, the presumption under Section  139 of N.I. Act will continue to remain. It is for Yogeshbhai to adduce  evidence to rebut the statutory presumption. When disputed  questions of facts are involved which need to be adjudicated after  the parties adduce evidence, the complaint under Section 138 of  the N.I. Act ought not to have been quashed by the High Court by  taking recourse to Section 482 Cr.P.C. Though, the Court has the  power to quash the criminal complaint filed under Section 138 of the  N.I. Act on the legal issues like limitation, etc. Criminal complaint  filed under Section 138 of the N.I. Act against Yogeshbhai ought not  have been quashed merely on the ground that there are inter se  dispute between appellant No.3 and respondent No.2. Without                                                                      16 keeping in view the statutory presumption raised under Section 139  of the N.I. Act, the High Court, in our view, committed a serious error  in quashing the criminal complaint in C.C.No.367/2016 filed under  Section 138 of N.I. Act.  21.   In the result, the impugned order is set aside and these  appeals are allowed. Criminal Misc. Application No.2735/2017 filed  by the appellants is allowed and the FIR No.I-194/2016 is quashed.  Criminal Misc. Application No.24588/2017 filed by Yogeshbhai  Muljibhai Patel stands dismissed. Case filed by appellant No.3-  Hasmukhbhai Ravjibhai Patel under Section 138 of N.I. Act -  C.C.No.367/2016 stands restored. The 5 th Additional Civil Judge &  JMFC, Bharuch is directed to proceed with the case in  C.C.No.367/2016 filed under Section 138 of N.I. Act and afford  sufficient opportunity to both the parties and dispose the same in  accordance with law. The Summary Suit No.105/2015 shall be  proceeded in accordance with law without being influenced by any  of the views expressed by the High Court in the impugned order.                                                  ..…………………….J.

Delay condoned. Leave granted.       1The Appellant now almost 80 years old, was undisputedly the                    owner of land admeasuring about 3.34 Hectares comprised in                    Khata/Khatuni No. 105 min/127, Khasra No. 70 in Tika Jalari                    Bhaddirain, Mauja Jalari, Tehsil Nadaun, Dist. Hamipur,                    Himachal Pradesh.       2The Respondent–State took over the land of the Appellant in Signature Not Verified  Digitally signed by SATISH KUMAR YADAV Date: 2020.01.08 16:52:42 IST Reason:                     1967–68 for the construction of a major District Road being                                                1    the Nadaun – Sujanpur Road, a major District Road without     taking recourse to acquisition proceedings, or following due     process of law.         The construction of the road was completed by 1975.  3The Appellant, being an illiterate widow, coming from a rural     background, was wholly unaware of her rights and entitlement     in law, and did not file any proceedings for compensation of     the land compulsorily taken over by the State.  4In 2004, some similarly situated persons whose lands had also     been taken over by the Respondent–State for the same public     purpose, filed CWP No.1192 of 2004 titled Anakh Singh & Ors.     v. State of Himachal Pradesh & Ors. claiming compensation     before the High Court of Himachal Pradesh.           The High Court vide Order dated 23.04.2007, allowed     CWP No.1192 of 2004, and directed the Respondent–State to     acquire the lands of the Writ Petitioners under the Land     Acquisition Act, 1894.  5Pursuant to the Order of the High Court in 2008, the     Respondent–State initiated acquisition proceedings under the     Land Acquisition Act, 1894 only with respect to the lands of                                   2    the Writ Petitioners, and not the other land­owners whose     lands had also been taken over.  6The Appellant submits that she learnt of these proceedings in     2010, when she alongwith her two daughters filed C.W.P. No.     1736 of 2010 before the Himachal Pradesh High Court,     praying that the State be directed to pay compensation for the     land acquired in 1967–68; or, in the alternative, direct the     State to initiate acquisition proceedings under the Land     Acquisition Act, 1894.            The Respondent–State filed its reply before the High     Court, wherein it was admitted that the Department had used     land in the ownership of the Appellant for the construction of     the Nadaun – Sujanpur road, a major district road in 1967–68.     The State had been in continuous possession of the property     since 1967–68, i.e., for the last 42 years, and the title of the     Respondent–State got converted into “adverse possession”. It     was submitted that the statutory remedy available to the     Appellant was by filing a Civil Suit.          The State has further admitted that a Notification under     Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act had been issued in 2008                                     3    with respect to the land of Anakh Singh a neighbouring land­     owner, whose land was similarly taken over for the same     purpose. Furthermore, the Writ Petition was barred by laches,     since the road was constructed in 1967–68, and metalled since     1975. The land was utilized by the Respondent–State after the     Appellant   and   her   predecessors­in­interest    had   verbally     consented to the land being taken over without any objection.  7The High Court vide the impugned Judgment and Order dated     11.09.2013 held that the matter involved disputed questions of     law and fact for determination on the starting point of     limitation, which could not be adjudicated in Writ proceedings.     The Appellant was granted liberty to file a Civil Suit.  8Aggrieved, the Appellant filed a Review Petition against the     Judgment and Order dated 11.09.2013 which was dismissed     vide Order dated 13.05.2014.  9The Appellant has filed the present Appeals before this Court, to     challenge the Judgment dated 11.09.2013 passed in the Writ     Petition and Order dated 13.05.2014 passed in the Review     Petition.                                       4 10 We have heard learned Counsel for the parties and perused      the record.  10.1. The Appellant was forcibly expropriated of her property in          1967, when the right to property was a fundamental right          guaranteed by Article 31 in Part III of the Constitution.                 Article 31 guaranteed the right to private property 1,          which could not be deprived without due process of law and          upon just and fair compensation.  10.2. The right to property ceased to be a fundamental right by          the Constitution (Forty Fourth Amendment) Act, 1978,          however, it continued to be a human right 2 in a welfare          State, and a Constitutional right under Article 300 A of the          Constitution. Article 300 A provides that no person shall be          deprived of his property save by authority of law. The State          cannot dispossess a citizen of his property except in          accordance with the procedure established by law. The          obligation to pay compensation, though not expressly          included in Article 300 A, can be inferred in that Article. 3    1 The State of West Bengal v. Subodh Gopal Bose and Ors. AIR 1954 SC 92.  2 Tukaram Kana Joshi & Ors. v. M.I.D.C. & Ors. (2013) 1 SCC 353.  3 K T Plantation Pvt. Ltd. v. State of Karnataka (2011) 9 SCC 1.                                               5              To forcibly dispossess a person of his private property,        without following due process of law, would be violative of a        human right, as also the constitutional right under Article        300 A of the Constitution.               Reliance is placed on the judgment in Hindustan        Petroleum Corporation Ltd.            v. Darius Shapur Chenai4,        wherein this Court held that:               “ 6. … Having regard to the provisions contained in              Article 300­A of the Constitution, the State in              exercise of its power of ""eminent domain"" may              interfere with the right of property of a person by              acquiring the same but the same must be for a              public purpose and reasonable compensation              therefor must be paid.”                                               (emphasis supplied)               In N. Padmamma v. S. Ramakrishna Reddy5, this Court        held that:               “21. If the right of property is a human right as also              a constitutional right, the same cannot be taken              away except in accordance with law. Article 300­A              of the Constitution protects such right. The              provisions of the Act seeking to divest such right,              keeping in view of the provisions of Article 300­A of              the Constitution of India, must be strictly construed.”                                                 (emphasis supplied)     4 (2005) 7 SCC 627. 5 (2008) 15 SCC 517.                                           6               In Delhi Airtech Services Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. v. State of U.P.         & Ors.6, this Court recognized the right to property as a         basic human right in the following words:                “30. It is accepted in every jurisprudence and by               different political thinkers that some amount of               property right is an indispensable safeguard against               tyranny     and    economic     oppression   of  the               Government. Jefferson was of the view that liberty               cannot long subsist without the support of property.               ""Property must be secured, else liberty cannot               subsist"" was the opinion of John Adams. Indeed the               view that property itself is the seed bed which must               be conserved if other constitutional values are to               flourish is the consensus among political thinkers               and jurists.”                                                 (emphasis supplied)                In Jilubhai Nanbhai Khachar v. State of Gujarat,7 this         Court held as follows :                “48. …In other words, Article 300­A only limits the               powers of the State that no person shall be deprived               of his property save by authority of law. There has               to be no deprivation without any sanction of law.               Deprivation by any other mode is not acquisition or               taking possession under Article 300­A. In other               words, if there is no law, there is no deprivation.”                                                  (emphasis supplied)  10.3. In this case, the Appellant could not have been forcibly         dispossessed of her property without any legal sanction,         and without following due process of law, and depriving her    6 (2011) 9 SCC 354.  7 (1995) Supp. 1 SCC 596.                                           7        payment of just compensation, being a fundamental right         on the date of forcible dispossession in 1967.  10.4. The contention of the State that the Appellant or her         predecessors had “orally” consented to the acquisition is         completely baseless. We find complete lack of authority and         legal sanction in compulsorily divesting the Appellant of her         property by the State.  10.5. In a democratic polity governed by the rule of law, the State         could not have deprived a citizen of their property without         the sanction of law. Reliance is placed on the judgment of         this Court in Tukaram Kana Joshi & Ors. v. M.I.D.C. & Ors.8         wherein it was held that the State must comply with the         procedure       for   acquisition,   requisition,   or   any   other         permissible statutory mode. The State being a welfare State         governed by the rule of law cannot arrogate to itself a status         beyond what is provided by the Constitution.                This Court in State of Haryana v. Mukesh Kumar held         that the right to property is now considered to be not only a         constitutional or statutory right, but also a human right.    8 (2013) 1 SCC 353.                                          8       Human rights have been considered in the realm of        individual rights such as right to shelter, livelihood, health,        employment, etc. Human rights have gained a multi­faceted        dimension.  10.6. We are surprised by the plea taken by the State before the        High Court, that since it has been in continuous possession        of the land for over 42 years, it would tantamount to        “adverse” possession. The State being a welfare State,        cannot be permitted to take the plea of adverse possession,        which allows a trespasser i.e. a person guilty of a tort, or        even a crime, to gain legal title over such property for over        12 years. The State cannot be permitted to perfect its title        over the land by invoking the doctrine of adverse possession        to grab the property of its own citizens, as has been done in        the present case.  10.7. The contention advanced by the State of delay and laches of        the Appellant in moving the Court is also liable to be        rejected. Delay and laches cannot be raised in a case of a        continuing cause of action, or if the circumstances shock        the judicial conscience of the Court. Condonation of delay is                                     9        a matter of judicial discretion, which must be exercised         judiciously and reasonably in the facts and circumstances         of a case. It will depend upon the breach of fundamental         rights, and the remedy claimed, and when and how the         delay arose. There is no period of limitation prescribed for         the courts to exercise their constitutional jurisdiction to do         substantial justice.                In a case where the demand for justice is so         compelling, a constitutional Court would exercise its         jurisdiction with a view to promote justice, and not defeat         it.9                In Tukaram Kana Joshi & Ors. v. M.I.D.C. & Ors.,10 this         Court while dealing with a similar fact situation, held as         follows :                “There are authorities which state that delay and               laches extinguish the right to put forth a claim. Most               of these authorities pertain to service jurisprudence,               grant of compensation for a wrong done to them               decades ago, recovery of statutory dues, claim for               educational facilities and other categories of similar               cases, etc. Though, it is true that there are a few               authorities that lay down that delay and laches               debar a citizen from seeking remedy, even if his               fundamental right has been violated, under Article  9 P.S. Sadasivaswamy v. State of T.N. (1975) 1 SCC 152. 10 (2013) 1 SCC 353.                                              10            32 or 226 of the Constitution, the case at hand deals            with a different scenario altogether. Functionaries of            the State took over possession of the land belonging            to the Appellants without any sanction of law. The            Appellants had asked repeatedly for grant of the            benefit of compensation. The State must either            comply with the procedure laid down for acquisition,            or requisition, or any other permissible statutory            mode.”                                              (emphasis supplied)  11 In the present case, the Appellant being an illiterate person,     who is a widow coming from a rural area has been deprived of     her private property by the State without resorting to the     procedure prescribed by law. The Appellant has been divested     of her right to property without being paid any compensation     whatsoever for over half a century. The cause of action in the     present case is a continuing one, since the Appellant was     compulsorily expropriated of her property in 1967 without     legal sanction or following due process of law.            The present     case is one where the demand for justice is so compelling since     the State has admitted that the land was taken over without     initiating acquisition proceedings, or any procedure known to     law. We exercise our extraordinary jurisdiction under Articles     136 and 142 of the Constitution, and direct the State to pay     compensation to the Appellant.                                       11 12 The State has submitted that in 2008 it had initiated     acquisition proceedings in the case of an adjoining land owner     viz. Shri Anakh Singh pursuant to a direction given by the     High Court in C.W.P.No.1192 of 2004. The State initiated     acquisition only in the case where directions were issued by     the High Court, and not in the case of other land owners     whose lands were compulsorily taken over, for the same     purpose, and at the same time. As a consequence, the present     land owner has been driven to move the Court in their     individual cases for redressal.  13 In view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances of the present     case,   the   Respondent–State     is   directed   to   pay   the     compensation on the same terms as awarded by the Reference     Court vide Order dated 07.07.2015 in Anakh Singh’s case     (i.e. Land Reference No.1 of 2011 RBT No.01/13) alongwith all     statutory benefits including solatium, interest, etc. within a     period of 8 weeks, treating it as a case of deemed acquisition.     An Affidavit of compliance is directed to be filed by the State     before this Court within 10 weeks.                                      12             It is informed that an appeal has been preferred by     Ravinder Singh s/o Anakh Singh & Ors. being RFA No.35 of     2016 which is pending before the High Court of Himachal     Pradesh at Shimla.          Taking note thereof, if an appeal is filed by the present     appellant within 8 weeks from the date of compensation being     paid to her by the State, the appeal will be treated to be within     limitation, and would be decided on its own merits in     accordance with law.              The Respondent­State is directed to pay legal costs and     expenses of Rs.1,00,0000/­ to the present appellant.  14 The Appeals are accordingly allowed. The Orders dated     11.09.2013 and 13.05.2014 passed by the High Court are set     aside.       Ordered accordingly.                                         …..……...........................J.

The challenge in the present appeal is to an order passed by the                                Division Bench of the Kerala High Court of 19.7.2019, whereby it                                was held that Section 14 of the Securitisation and Reconstruction                                of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 1                                mandating the District Magistrate to deliver possession of a                                secured asset within 30 days, extendable to an aggregate of 60 Signature Not Verified  Digitally signed by Vishal Anand                               days upon reasons recorded in writing, is a directory provision. Date: 2020.11.05 16:30:42 IST Reason:                                The High Court held as under:                        1    For short “the Act”                                                                                                   1             “18. The primary question in these Writ Petitions,             namely, whether the time limits in section 14 of the             SARFAESI Act are mandatory or directory should be             answered in light of the principles enumerated above.             As stated above, the object and purpose of the said             time limit is to ensure that such applications are             decided expeditiously so as to enable secured creditors             to take physical possession quickly and realise their             dues. Moreover, as stated earlier, the consequences of             non-compliance with the time limit are not specified             and the sequitur thereof would be that the district             collector/district magistrate concerned would not be             divested of jurisdiction upon expiry of the time limit. In             this connection, it is also pertinent to bear in mind that             if the “consequences of non-compliance” test is             applied, the borrower, guarantor or lessee, as the case             may be, is not adversely affected or prejudiced, in any             manner, whether such applications are decided in 60,             70 or 80 days. On the other hand, the secured creditor             is adversely affected if the provision is construed as             mandatory and not directory in as much as it would             delay the process of taking physical possession of             assets instead of expediting such process by entailing             the filing of another application for such purpose. For             all these reasons, the time limit stipulation in the             amended Section 14 of the SARFAESI Act is directory             and not mandatory.”  2.   The High Court examined Section 14 of the Act as amended, which       reads thus:              “14. Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or District Magistrate             to assist secured creditor in taking possession of             secured asset.- (1)                      xx                xx                   xx              Provided, further that on receipt of the affidavit from             the Authorised Officer, the District Magistrate or the             Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, as the case may be,             shall, after satisfying the contents of the affidavit pass             suitable orders for the purpose of taking possession of             the secured asset within a period of thirty days from the                                                                           2                   date of application:                    Provided also that if no order is passed by the Chief                   Metropolitan Magistrate or District Magistrate within the                   said period of thirty days for reasons beyond his                   control, he may, after recording reasons in writing for                   the same, pass the order within such period not                   exceeding in the aggregate sixty days.”   3.      The Act was enacted in the year 2002 for reasons that the legal          framework relating to commercial transactions had not kept pace          with the changing commercial practices. Further, financial sector          reforms resulted in a slow pace of recovery of defaulting loans and          mounting level of non-performing assets of banking and financial          institutions. The objectives behind the Act, recognised that unlike          international banks, banks and financial institutions in India, did          not have power to take possession of securities and sell them. The          provisions of the Act were upheld by this Court except that of sub-          section (2) of Section 17 which provided that the Debt Recovery          Tribunal shall not entertain an appeal preferred by a borrower          unless seventy-five per cent of the amount claimed has been          deposited before it2. Thereafter, the question as to whether the          withdrawal of an application filed under the Recovery of Debts due          to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 19933 is a condition          precedent to take recourse to the Act was examined by this Court 4.          This Court observed that when Civil Courts failed to expeditiously 2    Mardia Chemicals Ltd. & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors., (2004) 4 SCC 311 3    For short “DRT Act” 4    Transcore v. Union of India and Another, (2008) 1 SCC 125                                                                                 3          decide suits filed by the banks, the DRT Act was enacted, however           it did not provide for assignment of debts to Securitisation compa-           nies. The Act which was enacted thereafter in 2002 sought to fur-           ther empower the banks and facilitate the recovery of debt. It pro-           ceeded on the basis that once the liability of a borrower to repay           crystallises; it becomes due and that on account of delay, the ac-           count of such borrower becomes substandard and non-performing.  4.       Recently, this Court noticed the objects and reasons for amending           the Act in 2014 and held that the Magistrate takes possession of           the asset and “forwards” such asset to the secured creditor under           Section 14(1); the management of the business of a borrower can           actually be taken over under Section 15 of the Act and that           Section 13(4) must be read in the light of Sections 14 and 15.           These are separate and distinct modes of exercise of powers by a           secured creditor under the Act5.  5.       Section 14 of the Act, as originally enacted, empowered the Chief           Metropolitan Magistrate or the District Magistrate to take posses-           sion of such assets and documents relating to secured assets.           Later, by the Central Act No. 1 of 2013, which came into force on           15.1.2013, a proviso to sub-section (1) of Section 14 of the Act           was inserted contemplating that upon filing of an affidavit, in the           format mentioned therein, by an Authorised Officer of the secured  5    Hindon Forge Private Limited & Anr. v. State of Uttar Pradesh through District Magistrate,      Ghaziabad & Anr. (2019) 2 SCC 198                                                                                                    4         creditor, the District Magistrate or the Chief Metropolitan Magis-          trate shall pass suitable orders for the purpose of taking posses-          sion of the secured assets. It is, thereafter, the Act was amended          vide Central Act 44 of 2016, which came into force on 1.9.2016.   6.      The argument of Mr. Khan, learned counsel for the appellant, is          that the proviso mandating the District Magistrate to record rea-          sons, if the order is not passed within 30 days, in order to avail an          extended period of a total 60 days, shows that the provision is          mandatory. If the District Magistrate is not able to take decision          within 60 days, the secured creditor has to find its remedy else-          where and not in terms of Section 14 of the Act. It is contended          that the proviso mandates the District Magistrate to pass an order          within 30 days as the word “shall” is used in first part of the pro-          viso. Thus, the time limit provided is unambiguous and by corollary          the provision is mandatory. Reliance is placed on the judgments of          this Court in Union of India & Ors. v. A.K. Pandey6, Harshad          Govardhan Sondagar v. International Assets Reconstruc-          tion Company Limited & Ors.7, Dipak Babaria & Anr. v. State          of Gujarat & Ors.8, in support of his arguments that the use of          expression “shall” and the language of the second proviso in fixing          the time limit of 60 days after recording of reasons makes the pro-   6    (2009) 10 SCC 552 7    (2014) 6 SCC 1 8    (2014) 3 SCC 502                                                                              5         vision mandatory. If the District Magistrate has not been able to          take possession, the proceedings before him abates.  7.      A well settled rule of interpretation of the statutes is that the use          of the word “shall” in a statute, does not necessarily mean that in          every case it is mandatory that unless the words of the statute are          literally   followed,   the   proceeding     or   the    outcome     of   the          proceeding, would be invalid. It is not always correct to say that if          the word “may” has been used, the statute is only permissive or          directory in the sense that non-compliance with those provisions          will not render the proceeding invalid9 and that when a statute          uses the word “shall”, prima facie, it is mandatory, but the Court          may ascertain the real intention of the legislature by carefully at-          tending to the whole scope of the statute 10. The principle of literal          construction of the statute alone in all circumstances without ex-          amining the context and scheme of the statute may not serve the          purpose of the statute11.  8.      The question as to whether, a time limit fixed for a public officer to          perform a public duty is directory or mandatory has been          examined earlier by the Courts as well. A question arose before          the Privy Council in respect of irregularities in the preliminary          proceedings for constituting a jury panel.          The Municipality was   9 State of U.P. v. Manbodhan Lal Srivastava, AIR 1957 SC 912 10 State of U.P. & Ors. v. Babu Ram Upadhya, AIR 1961 SC 751 11 Reserve Bank of India v. Peerless General Finance and Investment Co. Ltd. & Ors. ,      (1987) 1 SCC 424                                                                                          6       expected to revise the list of qualified persons but the jury was        drawn from the old list as the Sheriff neglected to revise the same.        It was in these circumstances, the decision of the jury drawn from        the old list became the subject matter of consideration by the        Privy Council. It was thus held that it would cause greater public        inconvenience if it were held that neglecting to observe the        provisions of the statute made the verdicts of all juries taken from        the list ipso facto null and void so that no jury trials could be held        until a duly revised list had been prepared12.  9.    The Constitution Bench of this Court held that when the provisions        of a statute relate to the performance of a public duty and the        case is such that to hold acts done in neglect of this duty as null        and void, would cause serious general inconvenience or injustice        to persons who have no control over those entrusted with the        duty, the practice of the courts should be to hold such provisions        as directory13. In a seven Bench judgment, this Court was consid-        ering as to whether the power of the Returning Officer to reject        ballot papers is mandatory or directory. The Court examined well-        recognised rules of construction to observe that a statute should        be construed as directory if it relates to the performance of public        duties, or if the conditions prescribed therein have to be per-     12 Montreal Street Railway Company v. Normandin, AIR 1917 PC 142 13 Dattatraya Moreshwar Pangarkar v. State of Bombay & Ors., AIR 1952 SC 181                                                                                 7       formed by persons other than those on whom the right is con-        ferred14.  10.   In a judgment reported as Remington Rand of India Ltd. v.        Workmen15, Section 17 of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 came        up for consideration. The argument raised was that the time limit        of 30 days of publication of award by the labour court is        mandatory. This Court held that though Section 17 is mandatory,        the time limit to publish the award within 30 days is directory        inter-alia for the reason that the non-publication of the award        within the period of thirty days does not entail any penalty.  11.   In T.V. Usman v. Food Inspector, Tellicherry Municipality,        Tellicherry16, the time period during which report of the analysis        of a sample under Rule 7(3) of the Prevention of Food Adulteration        Rules, 1955 was to be given, was held to be directory as there was        no time-limit prescribed within which the prosecution had to be        instituted. When there was no such limit prescribed then there was        no valid reason for holding the period of 45 days as mandatory. Of        course, that does not mean that the Public Analyst can ignore the        time-limit prescribed under the rules. He must in all cases try to        comply with the time-limit. But if there is some delay, in a given        case, there is no reason to hold that the very report is void and, on        that basis, to hold that even prosecution cannot be launched. 14 Hari Vishnu Kamath v. Ahmad Ishaque & Ors.AIR 1955 SC 233 15 AIR 1968 SC 224 16 (1994) 1 SCC 754                                                                            8 12.   This Court distinguished between failure of an individual to act in a        given time frame and the time frame provided to a public        authority, for the purposes of determining whether a provision was        mandatory or directory, when this Court held that it is a well-        settled principle that if an act is required to be performed by a        private person within a specified time, the same would ordinarily        be mandatory but when a public functionary is required to perform        a public function within a time-frame, the same will be held to be        directory unless the consequences therefor are specified17.  13.    In P.T. Rajan v. T.P.M. Sahir & Ors.18, this Court examined the         affect of non-publication of final electoral rolls before the time of         acceptance of nomination papers. The Court held as under:                 “48. Furthermore, even if the statute specifies a time                for publication of the electoral roll, the same by itself                could not have been held to be mandatory. Such a                provision would be directory in nature. It is a well-                settled principle of law that where a statutory                functionary is asked to perform a statutory duty within                the time prescribed therefor, the same would be                directory and not mandatory.

A recent Constitution Bench held that the provisions of the         Consumer Protection Act granting 30 days’ time to file response by   17 Nasiruddin & Ors. v. Sita Ram Agarwal, (2003) 2 SCC 577 18 (2003) 8 SCC 498                                                                             9       the opposite party or such extended period not exceeding 15 days        is mandatory as the object of the statute is for the benefit and        protection of the consumer. It observed that such act had been        enacted to provide expeditious disposal of consumer disputes. In        this case, an individual was called upon to file his written        statement in contradiction for a pubic authority to decide the issue        before it19.  15.   The Full Bench of Patna High Court in Shiveshwar Prasad Sinha        was examining the provisions of the Bihar Buildings (Lease, Rent        and Eviction) Control Act, 1947 which permitted a Government        servant in occupation of a building as a tenant to serve a notice of        15 days on the landlord and the District Magistrate of his intention        to vacate the premises. The High Court held that the Government        servant to whom the house was allotted had no control over the        District Magistrate, therefore, the time limit required by the        provision was not mandatory.   16.   A Single Bench of Madhya Pradesh High Court 20 examined the        provisions of Section 14 of the Act as amended. The Court held        that the second proviso to sub-section (1) of Section 14 was        inserted in order to ensure that Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or        District Magistrate pass the order within a stipulated time. The   19 New India Assurance Company Limited v. Hilli Multipurpose Cold Storage Private    Limited, (2020) 5 SCC 757 20 In Manish Makhija v. Central Bank of India & Ors., 2018 SCC OnLine MP 553                                                                                      10         Bank/secured creditor has no control over the District Magistrate.          After filing an application under sub-section (1) of Section 14, the          Bank had no authority to compel the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate          or District Magistrate to pass orders within reasonable time. The          legislature, in order to bind the said authorities, inserted the said          proviso. Thus, the basic object and purpose was to fix a time limit          for the concerned Magistrate to pass an order and not to give a          clean chit to an unscrupulous borrower/guarantor, who had not          repaid the debts.   17.    Now, coming to the Judgments referred to by Mr. Khan. In A.K.         Pandey, the respondent was not provided 96 hours of interval time         as contemplated by the relevant rules, before commencing a trial         by the Court Martial. This Court held that such proceedings were         vitiated     as the purpose of the time limit was that before the         accused is called upon for trial, he must be given adequate time to         give a cool thought to the charge or charges for which he is to be         tried, decide about his defence and ask the authorities, if         necessary, to take reasonable steps in procuring the attendance of         his witnesses. He may even decide not to defend the charge(s) but         before he decides his line of action, he must be given clear ninety-         six hours.    18.    Harshad Govardhan Sondagar was a case where the person in                                                                              11       possession claimed tenancy rights in the premises as well as a        protected tenancy, being a tenant prior to creation of a mortgage.        It was held that the remedy of an aggrieved person against a        decision of Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or a District Magistrate        lay only before the High Court.            However, after the aforesaid        judgment was rendered on 3.4.2014, the Act had been amended        and sub-section 4A was inserted in Section 17 with effect from        1.9.2016. This provided a right to move an application to the        Debts Recovery Tribunal by a person who claimed tenancy or        leasehold rights.  19.   Dipak Babaria was a case wherein agricultural land was sold by        an     agriculturist   to    another   person   for   industrial   purposes.        Permission was to be granted by the Collector for the same. In        these circumstances, it was held that when a statute provides for        a thing to be done in a particular manner then it should be done in        that    manner     itself.     Such    proposition    does   not   arise   for        consideration in the present case.  20.   The Act was enacted to provide a machinery for empowering        banks and financial institutions, so that they may have the power        to take possession of secured assets and to sell them. The DRT        Act was first enacted to streamline the recovery of public dues but        the proceedings under the said Act have not given desirous re-        sults. Therefore, the Act in question was enacted. This Court in                                                                                    12 Mardia Chemical, Transcore and Hindon Forge Private Lim-  ited has held that the purpose of the Act pertains to the speedy  recovery of dues, by banks and financial institutions. The true in-  tention of the Legislature is a determining factor herein. Keeping  the objective of the Act in mind, the time limit to take action by  the District Magistrate has been fixed to impress upon the author-  ity to take possession of the secured assets. However, inability to  take possession within time limit does not render the District Mag-  istrate Functus Officio. The secured creditor has no control over  the District Magistrate who is exercising jurisdiction under Section  14 of the Act for public good to facilitate recovery of public dues.  Therefore, Section 14 of the Act is not to be interpreted literally  without considering the object and purpose of the Act. If any other  interpretation is placed upon the language of Section 14, it would  be contrary to the purpose of the Act. The time limit is to instill a  confidence in creditors that the District Magistrate will make an at-  tempt to deliver possession as well as to impose a duty on the Dis-  trict Magistrate to make an earnest effort to comply with the man-  date of the statute to deliver the possession within 30 days and for  reasons to be recorded within 60 days. In this light, the remedy  under Section 14 of the Act is not rendered redundant if the Dis-  trict Magistrate is unable to handover the possession. The District                                                                        13       Magistrate will still be enjoined upon, the duty to facilitate delivery        of possession at the earliest.  21.   Even though, this Court in United Bank of India v. Satyawati        Tondon & Ors.21 held that in cases relating to recovery of the        dues of banks, financial institutions and secured creditors, stay        granted by the High Court would have serious adverse impact on        the    financial   health   of   such   bodies/institutions,   which   will        ultimately prove detrimental to the economy of the nation.        Therefore, the High Court should be extremely careful and        circumspect in exercising its discretion to grant stay in such        matters. Hindon Forge Private Limited has held that the rem-        edy of an aggrieved person by a secured creditor under the Act is        by way of an application before the Debts Recovery Tribunal, how-        ever, borrowers and other aggrieved persons are invoking the ju-        risdiction of the High Court under Articles 226 or 227 of the Consti-        tution of India without availing the alternative statutory remedy.        The Hon’ble High Courts are well aware of the limitations in exer-        cising their jurisdiction when affective alternative remedies are        available, but a word of caution would be still necessary for the        High Courts that interim orders should generally not be passed        without hearing the secured creditor as interim orders defeat the        very purpose of expeditious recovery of public money.   21 (2010) 8 SCC 110                                                                                14 22.   Thus, we do not find any error in the order passed by the High        Court. Consequently, the appeal is dismissed.                                          .............................................J.                                                     (L.

The facts leading to the present appeal in nutshell are as  under:  2.1   That in a vehicular accident which occurred on 02.10.2006,  one Chotelal alias Shivram died.       The deceased was travelling on  motorcycle bearing registration No. RJ 02 SA 7811.

That  the appellants herein filed a claim petition before the Motor  Accident   Claims    Tribunal,    Laxmangarh      (Alwar),   Rajasthan  (hereinafter referred to as the learned Tribunal) under Section 163A  of the Motor Vehicles Act (hereinafter referred to as the Act). At this  stage, it is required to be noted that the claim petition was preferred  only against the owner of the motorcycle bearing registration No. RJ  02 SA 7811 and its insurance company. Neither the driver nor the  owner or the insurance company of the vehicle bearing registration  No. RJ 29 2M 9223 were joined as opponents in the claim petition.                                     3   Therefore, as such, no claim petition was filed against the driver,  owner and the insurance company of the vehicle involved in the  accident i.e. motorcycle bearing registration No. RJ 29 2M 9223.  That    an   objection   was   raised   by    the   respondent­insurance  company­insurer of motorcycle bearing registration No. RJ 02 SA  7811 that as according to the claimants and even so stated in the  FIR, the driver of the motorcycle bearing registration No. RJ 29 2M  9223 was rash and negligent and the claimants have not filed the  claim petition against the owner of the said vehicle, the claim  petition is required to be dismissed against the insurance company  of the motorcycle bearing registration No. RJ 02 SA 7811.             The  learned Tribunal framed the following issues:         1.    Whether accident was caused on 02.10.2006 by driver               Chhotelal alias Shivram driving Motorcycle RJ 02 SA               7811 vehicle in question in rash and negligent manner?         2.    Whether the driver was driving the said vehicle being in               the employment of vehicle owner opposite party No. 1               Bhagwan     Sahay    in    his    interest   or   with   his               permission/knowledge?                                    4         3.   Consequent     to   occurring   death   of   Chhotelal   alias             Shivram (driver) in the alleged accident, how much valid             amount and in what manner, the applicants are entitled             to get and from which opposite parties?        4.   Whether the objections raised in the preliminary/specific             statements are significant, if yes then its effect?        5.   Relief?  2.2   On appreciation of evidence, the learned Tribunal answered  Issue Nos. 1 and 2 in favour of the claimants and held that the  death of the deceased Chotelal alias Shivram had occurred from the  motorcycle involved in the accident and the said motorcycle was  insured with the respondent­insurance company, the insurance  company is liable to pay the compensation under Section 163A of  the Act.    Consequently, by the Judgment and Award dated  24.02.2009, the learned Tribunal partly allowed the said claim  petition and awarded a total sum of Rs.3,67,000/­as compensation  along with the interest @ 6% per annum from the date of filing of  the claim petition till the date of the actual payment                                   5   2.3   Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the Judgment and  Award passed by the learned Tribunal holding the insurance  company of the motorcycle bearing registration No. RJ 02 SA 7811  liable to pay the compensation, the respondent­insurance company­  insurer of motorcycle bearing registration No. RJ 02 SA 7811  preferred an appeal before the High Court. That, by the impugned  Judgment and Order, the High Court has allowed the said appeal  and has quashed and set aside the Judgment and Award passed by  the learned Tribunal and consequently has dismissed the claim  petition on the ground that even as per the informant Vikram  Singh, who lodged the FIR, the accident had occurred on account of  rash and negligent driving by the driver of motorcycle bearing  registration No. RJ 29 2M 9223, however, the claimants have not  filed the claim petition against the owner of the said vehicle and in  fact, the claim petition should have been filed by the claimants  against the owner of vehicle bearing No. RJ 29 2M 9223 to seek  compensation.                                    6   2.4   Feeling   aggrieved   and   dissatisfied   with   the   impugned  Judgment and Order passed by the High Court, the original  claimants have preferred the present appeal.  3.    Shri Abhishek Gupta, learned advocate appearing on behalf of  the appellants­original claimants has vehemently submitted that  the High Court has materially erred in dismissing the claim petition  solely on the ground that the claimants have not filed the claim  petition against the owner of the motorcycle bearing registration No.  RJ 29 2M 9223.  3.1   It is submitted by the learned advocate appearing on behalf of  the appellants­original claimants that, as such, the High Court has  not properly appreciated the fact that the claim petition preferred by  the original claimants was under Section 163A of the Act and,  therefore, when the claim petition was preferred under Section  163A of the Act, there is no need for the claimants to plead or  establish that the death in respect of which the claim petition has  been made was due to any wrongful act or neglect or default of  owner of vehicle concerned.                                    7   3.2    It is further submitted by the learned advocate appearing on  behalf of the appellants­original claimants that the claim petition  filed by the original claimants was based on the principle of no­fault  liability.   It is submitted that the claimants could have elected to  file the claim petition either under Section 166 read with Section  140 of the Act against the owner/insurer of offending vehicle i.e. RJ  29 2M 9223 on the basis of the fault liability or under Section 163A  either against the owner/insurer of the vehicle being driven by the  deceased at the time of accident i.e. RJ 02 SA 7811 or against the  owner/insurer of offending vehicle i.e. RJ 29 2M 9223 on the basis  of no­fault liability.    It is submitted by the learned advocate  appearing on behalf of the appellants­original claimants that, as  such, the deceased was not the owner of the vehicle bearing  registration No. RJ 02 SA 7811 and in fact and as observed by the  learned Tribunal, he was in employment of owner of the vehicle No.  RJ 02 SA 7811 and therefore a third party. It is submitted that  having elected to prefer the claim under Section 163A of the Act on  the principle of no­fault liability against the owner/insurer of the  vehicle being driver by the deceased at the time of the accident i.e.                                  8   RJ 02 SA 7811, the claim was perfectly just and maintainable and  the learned Tribunal made no error in allowing the same.          In  support of the above, the learned advocate appearing on behalf of  the original claimants has heavily relied upon the decision of this  Court in the case of Reshma Kumari v. Madan Mohan (2013) 9  SCC 65.  3.3   Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original claimants  has further submitted that Section 163A of the Act has to be  interpreted in keeping with the intention of the Legislature and the  social perspective it seeks to achieve.   It is a provision which is  beneficial in nature and it has been enacted as a measure of social  security.   It is submitted that Section 163A of the Act commences  with a “non­obstante” clause. Liability to pay the compensation is  on “owner of the motor vehicle” or “the authorized insurer”. It is  submitted that the word “owner” has been defined under Section  2(30) to mean “a person in whose name a motor vehicle stands  registered, and where such person is a minor, the guardian of such  minor, and in relation to a motor vehicle which is the subject of a  hire­purchase, agreement or an agreement of lease or an agreement                                    9   of hypothecation, the person in possession of the vehicle under that  agreement.” It is submitted that having regard to the said definition  of “owner”, this Court in Naveen Kumar v. Vijay Kumar (2018) 3  SCC 1 has held the registered owner of the vehicle as per the  registering authority liable in respect of the offending vehicle despite  sale/purchase of vehicle by him. It is submitted that, in paragraph  6, it is held that the person in whose name the motor vehicle stands  registered is the owner of the vehicle for the purpose of the Act.  3.4   It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on  behalf of the appellants­original claimants that for claiming the  compensation under Section 163A of the Act, the claimants are only  required to prove that the death or permanent disablement is as a  result of the accident arising out of the use of motor vehicle and it  will cover those who are themselves driving a vehicle, the  passengers and also pedestrians.        It is submitted that in an  application under Section 163A of the Act, fault of the owner of the  vehicle or vehicles concerned or of any other person need not be  established.                                 10   3.5   It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on  behalf of the appellants­original claimants that, therefore, as the  present claim premised on the no­fault liability under Section 163A  of the Act by the legal heirs of the deceased, the same was  maintainable against the owner and insurer of the motor vehicle  which was being driven by him, more particularly, when the  deceased was not the owner of the vehicle and that respondent No.  2 was the registered owner of the concerned vehicle and, therefore,  the insurance company cannot be absolved from its liability to pay  the compensation as awarded by the learned Tribunal.  3.6   Making the above submissions, it is prayed to allow the  present appeal and quash and set aside the impugned Judgment  and Order passed by the High Court and to restore the Judgment  and Award passed by the learned Tribunal holding the owner of the  vehicle bearing registration No. RJ 02 SA 7811 and the insurer of  the said vehicle to pay the compensation.  3.7   It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on  behalf of the appellants­original claimants that, as such, the  amount of compensation awarded by the learned Tribunal i.e.                                  11   Rs.3,67,000/­ should be enhanced to Rs.5,00,000/­ with interest  as awarded by the learned Tribunal in light of the fact that the 2 nd  Schedule to the Motor Vehicle Act has been amended with effect  from 22.05.2018 and a fixed compensation of Rs.5,00,000/­ has  been specified in the case of death.   It is submitted that this Court  has enhanced the compensation even in those cases wherein no  appeal for enhancement has been preferred against the order of the  Tribunal.   In support thereof, the learned counsel appearing on  behalf of the original claimants has relied upon the decision of this  Court in the case of Jitender Trivedi v. Kasam Daud (2015) 4  SCC 237.  4.    The present appeal is vehemently opposed by Shri Amit Kumar  Singh, learned advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent­  insurance company.  4.1   It is submitted by the learned advocate appearing on behalf of  the respondent­insurance company that, in the present case, the  deceased borrowed the motorcycle bearing registration No. RJ 02  SA 7811 from the registered owner Bhagwan Sahay. It is submitted  that another motorcycle bearing registration No. RJ 29 2M 9223                                 12   which was driven in a rash and negligent manner came and hit the  motorcycle on which the deceased was travelling.    It is submitted  that the FIR was lodged against the owner of motorcycle bearing  registration No. RJ 29 2M 9223. It is thus clear that the insured  vehicle on which the deceased was travelling i.e. RJ 02 SA 7811  was not negligent.   It is submitted that, in the present case, the  claimants of the deceased filed an application under Section 163A  of the Act and sought compensation only from the owner of the  insured vehicle i.e. RJ 02 SA 7811.       It is submitted that the  learned Tribunal without any evidence on record has concluded  that the deceased was working under the employment of the  registered owner. It is submitted that, therefore, in the facts and  circumstances of the case, the High Court has rightly allowed the  appeal preferred by the insurer by observing that the claimants  ought to have filed the claim petition against the owner of the  vehicle bearing registration No. RJ 29 2M 9223.      In support of  impugned Judgment and Order passed by the High Court, learned  advocate appearing on behalf of the insurance company has made  the following submissions:                                    13   (i)     That the deceased was not a third party with respect to the  insured vehicle. He was a third party with respect to the motorcycle  bearing registration No. RJ 29 2M 9223;  (ii)    That the claimants when failed to claim the compensation  from the owner of the motorcycle bearing registration No. RJ 29 2M  9223, cannot be permitted, as the driver of the said motorcycle, to  claim compensation from the owner of the vehicle bearing  registration No. RJ 02 SA 7811;  (iii)   That under the Motor Vehicles Act, only the third party claims  are payable;  (iv)    That in the present case, the deceased was not a third party  given that he had borrowed the vehicle from the registered owner  Shri Bhagwan Sahay Meena;  (v)     That in the case of Ningamma v. United India Insurance  Co. Ltd. (2009) 13 SCC 710 and New India Assurance Co. Ltd. V.  Sadanand Mukhi (2009) 2 SCC 417, this Court has held that the  owner of the vehicle or his legal representatives or the borrower of  the vehicle cannot raise a claim for an accident in which there was  no negligence on the part of the insured vehicle.      It is submitted                                   14   that in the aforesaid decisions, this Court has held that the  borrower of the vehicle steps into the shoes of the owner and,  therefore, the borrower of the vehicle or his legal representatives are  not entitled to compensation from the insurer under the Act.      It is  submitted that the deceased in the present case has stepped into  the shoes of the owner and therefore not entitled to any third party  compensation from the insured vehicle; and  (vi)   That in the case of Dhanraj v. New India Assurance Co. Ltd.  (2004) 8 SCC 553 it is held by this Court that an insurance policy  covers the liability incurred by the insured in respect of death of or  bodily injury to any person (including an owner of the goods or his  authorized representative) carried in the vehicle or damage to any  property of a third party caused by or arising out of the use of the  vehicle.    It is further held that Section 147 does not require an  insurance company to assume risk for death or bodily injury to the  owner of the vehicle.  4.2    It is further submitted by the learned advocate appearing on  behalf of the insurance company that in the present case the  contract of insurance specifically provides that in case of personal                                  15   accident the owner cum driver is only entitled to a sum of Rs.1  Lakh. It is submitted that therefore the deceased who had stepped  into the shoes of the owner at the most may be entitled to a sum of  Rs.1 Lakh only.     It is submitted that in the case of Oriental  Insurance Co. Ltd. V. Rajni Devi (2008) 5 SCC 736 when the  compensation is claimed for the death of the owner or another  passenger of the vehicle, the contract of insurance being governed  by the contract qua contract, the claim of the insurance company  would depend upon the terms thereof.     It is submitted that, in the  said decision, this Court did not accept the view taken by the  Tribunal that while determining the amount of compensation, the  only factor which would be relevant would be merely the use of the  motor vehicle.   It is submitted that, in the aforesaid decision, in  paragraph 11, it is further observed by this Court that the liability  under Section 163A of the Act is on the owner of the vehicle as a  person cannot be both, a claimant as also a recipient.  4.3   Relying upon the decision of this Court, in the case of  National Insurance Co. Ltd. V. Ashalata Bhowmik             (2018) 9  SCC 801, it is submitted that the parties shall be governed by the                                  16   terms and conditions of the contract of insurance. It is submitted  that, therefore, at the most, the claimants may be entitled to Rs. 1  lakh only, the deceased being in the shoes of the owner.  4.4   Now, so far as the submission on behalf of the appellants­  original claimants that there is an amendment to the 2 nd Schedule,  and a fixed compensation of Rs.5 lakhs has been specified in the  case of death and, therefore, the claimants shall be entitled to Rs.5  lakhs, it is vehemently submitted by the learned advocate appearing  on behalf of the insurance company that the said amendment shall  not be applicable retrospectively.    It is submitted that, in the  present case, the accident had taken place in the year 2006 and  even the Judgment and Award was passed by the learned Tribunal  in the year 2009, and the impugned Judgment and Order has been  passed by the High Court on 18.02.2018, i.e. prior to the  amendment in the 2nd Schedule.  4.5   Making the above submissions, it is prayed to dismiss the  present appeal and/or partly allow the appeal to the extent of Rs.1  Lakh as per the terms and conditions of the contract of insurance.                                     17   5.   Heard learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respective  parties at length.     We have also perused and considered the  Judgment and Award passed by the learned Tribunal as well as the  impugned Judgment and Order passed by the High Court and the  evidence on record.         The short question which is posed for  consideration   of   this   Court   is   whether,   in   the   facts   and  circumstances of the case and in a case where the driver, owner  and the insurance company of another vehicle involved in an  accident and whose driver was negligent are not joined as parties to  the claim petition, meaning thereby that no claim petition is filed  against them and the claim petition is filed only against the owner  and the insurance company of another vehicle which was driven by  the deceased himself and the deceased being in the shoes of the  owner of the vehicle driven by himself, whether the insurance  company of the vehicle driven by the deceased himself would be  liable to pay the compensation under Section 163A of the Act?;  Whether the deceased not being a third party to the vehicle No. RJ  02 SA 7811 being in the shoes of the owner can maintain the claim  under Section 163A of the Act from the owner of the said vehicle?                                   18   5.1   The learned Tribunal held that even in absence of the driver,  owner and the insurance company of another vehicle involved in an  accident and whose driver was solely negligent, the application  under Section 163A of the Act would be maintainable against the  owner and the insurance company of the vehicle which was driven  by the deceased himself, firstly on the ground that the deceased  was in employment of the owner of the vehicle which was driven by  him and secondly, in an application under Section 163A of the Act,  the negligence is not required to be established and proved and it is  enough to establish and prove that the deceased has died in a  vehicular accident and while driving a vehicle. The High Court has  not agreed with the same and by the impugned Judgment and  Order has held that as the claimants have not filed the claim  petition against the owner of another vehicle whose driver was in  fact negligent, even as per the claimants and the claim petition  should have been filed by the claimants against the owner of  another vehicle to seek the compensation, the application under  Section 163A of the Act against the insurance company of the  vehicle driven by the deceased himself is liable to be dismissed.                                   19   5.2   While answering the aforesaid question involved in the present  case, first of all, the findings recorded by the learned Tribunal on  Issue No. 2 is required to be dealt with and considered. The learned  Tribunal framed Issue No. 2 to the effect whether the deceased­  driver was driving the vehicle­motor cycle bearing registration No.  RJ 02 SA 7811 being in employment of the vehicle owner­opposite  party­Bhagwan      Sahay     in   his     interest     or   with    his  permission/knowledge?  5.3   While answering the finding recorded by the learned Tribunal  on Issue No. 2, it appears that, as such, the learned Tribunal has  not at all answered the aforesaid issue. While answering Issue No.  2, there is no specific finding whether the deceased­driver was in  employment of the opponent­owner Bhagwan Sahay or not.             Even  otherwise, no evidence is led by the claimants to prove that the  deceased­driver   was   in   employment     of   the   opponent­owner  Bhagwan Sahay. Despite the above, while answering Issue No. 4  there is some observation made by the learned Tribunal that the  deceased­driver   was   in   employment     of   the   opponent­owner  Bhagwan Sahay, which is not supported by any evidence on record.                                  20   Under the circumstances, the deceased­driver cannot be said to be  in employment of the opponent­owner Bhagwan Sahay and,  therefore, he can be said to be permissible user and/or borrower of  motor vehicle owned by the opponent­owner Bhagwan Sahay. With  these findings, the main question posed for consideration of this  Court referred to hereinabove is required to be considered.  5.4   An identical question came to be considered by this Court in  the case of Ningamma (supra).         In that case, the deceased was  driving a motorcycle which was borrowed from its real owner and  met with an accident by dashing against a bullock cart i.e. without  involving any other vehicle.   The claim petition was filed under  Section 163A of the Act by the legal representatives of the deceased  against the real owner of the motorcycle which was being driven by  the deceased. To that, this Court has observed and held that since  the deceased has stepped into the shoes of the owner of the vehicle,  Section 163A of the Act cannot apply wherein the owner of the  vehicle himself is involved. Consequently, it was held that the legal  representatives of the deceased could not have claimed the  compensation under Section 163A of the Act. Therefore, as such, in                                 21   the present case, the claimants could have even claimed the  compensation and/or filed the claim petition under Section 163A of  the Act against the driver, owner and insurance company of the  offending vehicle i.e. motorcycle bearing registration No. RJ 29 2M  9223, being a third party with respect to the offending vehicle.  However, no claim under Section 163A was filed against the driver,  owner and/or insurance company of the motorcycle bearing  registration No. RJ 29 2M 9223.      It is an admitted position that  the claim under Section 163A of the Act was only against the owner  and the insurance company of the motorcycle bearing registration  No. RJ 02 SA 7811 which was borrowed by the deceased from the  opponent­owner Bhagwan Sahay. Therefore, applying the law laid  down by this Court in the case of Ningamma (supra), and as the  deceased has stepped into the shoes of the owner of the vehicle  bearing registration No. RJ 02 SA 7811, as rightly held by the High  Court, the claim petition under Section 163A of the Act against the  owner and insurance company of the vehicle bearing registration  No. RJ 02 SA 7811 shall not be maintainable.                                   22   5.5   It is true that, in a claim under Section 163A of the Act, there  is no need for the claimants to plead or establish the negligence  and/or that the death in respect of which the claim petition is  sought to be established was due to wrongful act, neglect or default  of the owner of the vehicle concerned.   It is also true that the claim  petition under Section 163A of the Act is based on the principle of  no fault liability. However, at the same time, the deceased has to be  a third party and cannot maintain a claim under Section 163A of  the Act against the owner/insurer of the vehicle which is borrowed  by him as he will be in the shoes of the owner and he cannot  maintain a claim under Section 163A of the Act against the owner  and insurer of the vehicle bearing registration No. RJ 02 SA 7811.  In the present case, the parties are governed by the contract of  insurance and under the contract of insurance the liability of the  insurance company would be qua third party only. In the present  case, as observed hereinabove, the deceased cannot be said to be a  third party with respect to the insured vehicle bearing registration  No. RJ 02 SA 7811.      There cannot be any dispute that the liability  of the insurance company would be as per the terms and conditions                                   23   of the contract of insurance. As held by this Court in the case of  Dhanraj (supra), an insurance policy covers the liability incurred  by the insured in respect of death of or bodily injury to any person  (including an owner of the goods or his authorized representative)  carried in the vehicle or damage to any property of a third party  caused by or arising out of the use of the vehicle.     In the said  decision, it is further held by this Court that Section 147 does not  require an insurance company to assume risk for death or bodily  injury to the owner of the vehicle.  5.6   In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, in the  present case, as the claim under Section 163A of the Act was made  only against the owner and insurance company of the vehicle which  was being driven by the deceased himself as borrower of the vehicle  from the owner of the vehicle and he would be in the shoes of the  owner, the High Court has rightly observed and held that such a  claim was not maintainable and the claimants ought to have joined  and/or ought to have made the claim under Section 163A of the Act  against the driver, owner and/or the insurance company of the                                  24   offending vehicle i.e. RJ 29 2M 9223 being a third party to the said  vehicle.  5.7    Now, so far as the reliance placed upon by the learned  Advocate for the claimants on the decision of this Court in the case  of Naveen Kumar (supra), on considering the issue involved in that  decision, we are of the opinion that the said decision shall not be  applicable to the facts of the case on hand and/or the same shall  not be of any assistance to the claimants. In that case, the issue  was as to who could be said to be the registered owner of the vehicle  and the liability of the owner who sold the vehicle, but his name  continued to be as the owner with the registering authority.      To  that, it was held that the person in whose name the motor vehicle  stands registered is the owner of the vehicle for the purpose of the  Act.  5.8    However, at the same time, even as per the contract of  insurance, in case of personal accident the owner­driver is entitled  to a sum of Rs.1 lakh.      Therefore, the deceased, as observed  hereinabove, who would be in the shoes of the owner shall be  entitled to a sum of Rs.1 lakh, even as per the contract of                                   25   insurance.     However, it is the case on behalf of the original  claimants that there is an amendment to the 2 nd Schedule and a  fixed amount of Rs.5 lakh has been specified in case of death and  therefore the claimants shall be entitled to Rs.5 lakh.       The same  cannot be accepted. In the present case, the accident took place in  the year 2006 and even the Judgment and Award was passed by  the learned Tribunal in the year 2009, and the impugned Judgment  and Order has been passed by the High Court in 10.05.2018, i.e.  much prior to the amendment in the 2nd Schedule.             In the facts  and circumstance of the present case, the claimants shall not be  entitled to the benefit of the amendment to the 2 nd Schedule.        At  the same time, as observed hereinabove, the claimants shall be  entitled to Rs.1 lakh as per the terms of the contract of insurance,  the driver being in the shoes of the owner of the vehicle.  5.9   Now, so far as the submission made on behalf of the claimants  that in a claim under Section 163A of the Act mere use of the  vehicle is enough and despite the compensation claimed by the  heirs of the owner of the motorcycle which was involved in the  accident resulting in his death, the claim under Section 163A of the                                   26   Act would be maintainable is concerned, in view of the decision of  this Court in Rajni Devi (supra), the aforesaid cannot be accepted.  In Rajni Devi (supra), it has been specifically observed and held  that the provisions of Section 163A of the Act cannot be said to  have any application with regard to an accident wherein the owner  of the motor vehicle himself is involved.       After considering the  decisions of this Court in the cases of Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd.  V. Jhuma Saha (2007) 9 SCC 263; Dhanraj (supra); National  Insurance Co. Ltd. V. Laxmi Narain Dhut (2007) 3 SCC 700 and  Premkumari v. Prahlad Dev (2008) 3 SCC 193, it is ultimately  concluded by this Court that the liability under Section 163A of the  Act is on the owner of the vehicle as a person cannot be both, a  claimant as also a recipient and, therefore, the heirs "

The defendants are in appeal aggrieved against an order passed by       the High Court of Karnataka on 14 th June, 2005 whereby the appeal       filed by the plaintiff - C. Jayarama Reddy was allowed by setting       aside the concurrent findings of facts recorded by two courts       below. The High Court answered the following substantial question       of law:                 “Whether the judgment and decree passed by the                Courts below suffer from illegality on account of                improper consideration of Ex.P1, i.e., school leaving                certificate?”   2.   The plaintiff filed a suit for partition and separate possession of       1/4th share in the Suit schedule property between himself and his       three brothers who are defendant Nos. 1, 2 and 3. Defendant Nos.       4 to 17 are the persons who have purchased the property from the                                                                          1      defendant Nos. 1 to 3, the brothers. The plaintiff claimed that he       was minor at the time of death of his father in the year 1963 and       that he continued as a member of the joint Hindu family in joint       possession and enjoyment of the property of joint Hindu family. The       plaintiff asserted that his signatures were obtained on a few       documents and that he was not aware of the contents of the same       nor did he execute any document thereof and understood what       they were. Para 6 of the plaint reads thus:                “6. The plaintiff was kept in the dark about the family               affairs and implicitly obeyed the dictates of the other               defendants and did whatever he was asked to do. In               fact, his signatures were taken on few documents and               the plaintiff is not aware of the contents nor did he               execute any document thereof or understands what they               were.”  3.   In the written statement filed, it was asserted that the plaintiff and       defendant Nos. 1 to 3 and their father were members of joint Hindu       family till 15th June, 1963. The plaintiff demanded and wished to       separate himself from the joint Hindu family and executed a       release deed on 15th June, 1963 and severed all the connections       from the joint Hindu family when he received consideration of       Rs.5,000/- for his share and relinquished all his rights in the family.       The plaintiff went away from the family after execution of the       release deed and lived at Kempapura village since 1963 in his       father-in-law’s house. It was denied that the plaintiff was minor at       the time of death of his father.     It was further pleaded that he       married one Mamjamma d/o Nanjundappa of Kempapura on 29 th       June, 1964.                                                                             2 4.   On the basis of respective pleadings of the parties, the trial court       framed as many as 16 issues. However, the relevant issues are       Issue Nos. 1 and 2 at this stage, which read as under:                “1. Whether the plaintiff was a minor in 1963?                2. Whether the plaintiff separated from the joint family               and executed a release deed dated 15.06.1963? If so, is               the same valid and is the plaintiff entitled to a share?”  5.   The plaintiff in order to prove that he was minor produced School       Leaving Certificate Ex. P/1 and also examined his brother PW.2 C.       Ramaswamy Reddy. The brother did not depose about the age of       the plaintiff at the time of death of his father. The plaintiff has not       produced any official from the school to prove that such certificate       was from the record of the school nor did he examine Head Master       who has issued such certificate.         The plaintiff has also not       examined his mother who was available at the time when the       evidence of the plaintiff was being recorded.   6.   The learned trial court on Issue No. 1 found that the registered       release deed (Ex.D/1) dated 15th June, 1963 mentions the age of       the plaintiff as about 22 years and subsequent to the execution of       the release deed the plaintiff married Nanjamma on 29 th June,       1964.   The registered marriage deed Ex D-2, produced by the       defendants, also proves that the age of the plaintiff was 24 years.       The trial court did not rely on the date of birth of the plaintiff       mentioned in the School Leaving Certificate (Ex.P/1) as the same       was not put by the Head Master of the School and the plaintiff did                                                                              3      not examine the Head Master of the School to prove the contents       of the School Leaving Certificate. Thus, the learned trial court held       that the plaintiff was not a minor at the time of execution of       release deed in favour of his brothers and his father.   7.   Learned trial court further held that the plaintiff has stated that       some of his signatures were taken by his father on few documents       and he was not aware of the contents of those documents. The       defendants have proved the execution of the release deed by the       plaintiff. The plaintiff admitted that he executed a release deed on       15th June, 1963 and has been residing with his father-in-law in       Kempapura because a dispute arose between his father and       brothers and himself. He admitted that his father died on 30 th June,       1963 and that his brothers are residing separately since 1964. The       trial court further held that the plaintiff has not pleaded any fraud       or coercion in respect of release deed, thus, the Court came to the       conclusion that the release deed is valid and the plaintiff is not       entitled to any share in the suit schedule properties.   8.   Aggrieved, plaintiff filed appeal before the learned First Appellate       Court. The learned First Appellate Court examined the questions       as to whether on the date of execution of the release deed, the       plaintiff was a major or not and whether the release deed obtained       by undue influence or coercion etc.       The Court held that the       plaintiff had not pleaded at any time that the release deed was       obtained by fraud or coercion or that he had not received any                                                                             4          consideration thereunder.      After discussing the statements of           witnesses and the documents produced by the parties, the First           Appellate Court held that plaintiff was not a minor at the time of           execution of release deed and, thus, dismissed the appeal of the           plaintiff and that the order of dismissal of suit of the learned trial           court was upheld.   9.       In second appeal, the substantial question framed by the High           Court was whether the judgment and decree passed by the courts           below suffers from illegality on account of improper consideration           of Ex.P/1, i.e., School Leaving Certificate. The High Court returned           a finding that Ex.P/1 is a transfer certificate and, thus, the plaintiff           was minor and such certificate is admissible as proof of age under           Section 35 of the Evidence Act. It was held that since the plaintiff           was minor on the date when the release deed was executed on 15 th           June, 1963, therefore, such deed is null and void and incapable for           raising a plea of estoppel. The reliance was placed upon Nawab           Sadiq Ali Khan & Ors. v. Jai Kishori & Ors.1. After returning           such finding, the High Court held that release deed is null and void           and not binding, though the High Court returned finding that the           plaintiff has received a consideration of Rs.5,000/- at that time.  10.      Learned counsel for the plaintiff relied upon the judgment of this           Court reported as Wali Singh v. Sohan Singh2 wherein the           relinquishment by one Kirpal Singh as a guardian of Wali Singh was           found to be infructuous in law.  1     AIR 1928 Privy Council 152 2     AIR 1954 SC 263                                                                                 5 11.   We do not find any merit in the argument raised by learned        counsel for the plaintiff relying upon judgment in Wali Singh. In        Wali Singh, the plaintiff challenged the mutation said to have        been made during his minority.       The argument was that he        inherited property on the date of death of Kirpal Singh but before        his adoption. The High Court dismissed the suit filed by Wali Singh,        interalia, for the reason that it was incumbent upon Wali Singh to        get the transfer set aside within three years of attaining majority        notwithstanding that the parties may have continued in joint        possession. It was on the statement of Kirpal Singh, his adopted        father, that the mutation was sanctioned that Wali Singh does not        have any concern with the property of his natural father. It was        found that the statement made by Kirpal Singh was not based        upon any transfer or relinquishment as the guardian of Wali Singh        whereas the release by minor Wali Singh was infructuous in law.        Therefore, the suit cannot be said to be barred by virtue of Article        44 of the Limitation Act. The said judgment has no applicability to        the facts of the present case as it does not deal with the question        of admissibility of a School Leaving Certificate which would        determine the date of birth.  12.   The argument of learned counsel for the plaintiff-respondent is that        transfer certificate is a public document which was prepared on the        basis of a statement made by his father. Such document bears the        signature of his father as well.   It is also contended that such        document is prepared in the course of official duty of the staff of                                                                           6          the Government School, therefore, there is presumption of           correctness in terms of Section 35 of the Indian Evidence Act,           1872.    Learned counsel for the plaintiff has also referred to the           judgment of this Court reported as Birad Mal Singhvi v. Anand           Purohit3 wherein, the entry recording the Date of Birth in the           School Register is said to have a probative value. Reference is also           made to a judgment reported as Madan Mohan Singh & Ors. v.           Rajni Kant & Anr.4 to contend that the entry in the School           Register cannot be brushed aside.  13.      Learned counsel for the plaintiff also relied upon the judgment of           this    Court   reported   as   Madhegowda     (Dead)    by   LRs    v.           Ankegowda (Dead) by LRs & Ors.5 that filing of a suit is           sufficient to repudiate the alleged relinquishment deed, which is a           void document.  14.      We do not find any merit in the arguments raised.          The public           document in terms of Section 74 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872           includes the documents forming records of official bodies or           tribunals. Section 76 of the said Act gives a right to any person to           demand a copy of a public document on payment of a fee together           with the certificate written at the foot of such copy that it is a true           copy of such document. Certified copies may be produced in proof           of the contents of the public documents or parts of the public           documents of which they purport to be copies. The plaintiff has           produced photocopy of the Certificate (Ex.P/1) on the records of  3     1988 (Supp.) SCC 604 4     (2010) 9 SCC 209 5     (2002) 1 SCC 178                                                                                 7       this appeal. Such Certificate does not show that it is said to be a        certified copy of a public document as contemplated by Section 76        of the said Act.  15.   School Leaving Certificate has been produced by the plaintiff and        said to be signed by his father. The person who has recorded the        date of birth in the School Register or the person who proves the        signature of his father in the School Transfer Certificate has not        been examined. No official from the School nor any person has        proved the signatures of his father on such certificate. Apart from        the self-serving statement, there is no evidence to show that the        entry of the date of birth was made by the official in-charge, which        alone would make it admissible as evidence under Section 35 of        the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. However, the High Court has not        found any other evidence to prove the truthfulness of the        Certificate (Ex.P/1).  16.   The reliance of the plaintiff on Madhegowda is again not relevant        to the issues arising in the present case. In the aforesaid case, the        property of admittedly a minor was sold by sister of the minor        purportedly acting as a guardian. There was no dispute about the        age of the seller who was minor. The dispute in the present appeal        revolves around the fact whether the plaintiff was a minor on the        date the release deed was executed. The entire case is based upon        School Transfer Certificate (Ex.P/1) which does not prove the date        of birth, recorded therein, as reliable and trustworthy.  17.   In Birad Mal Singhvi, the Date of Birth was sought to be proved                                                                              8       by the Principal of the School.      Though, the Principal could not        produce the admission form in original or its copy.          It was held        therein that the entries contained in the school’s register are        relevant and admissible but have no evidentiary value for the        purpose of proof of date of birth of the candidates. A vital piece of        evidence was missing as no evidence was placed before the court        to show on whose information the date of birth was recorded in the        aforesaid document. It was held as under:                 “14. …..No doubt, Exs. 8. 9, 10, 11 and 12 are relevant                and admissible but these documents have no                evidentiary value for purpose of proof of date of birth of                Hukmi Chand and Suraj Prakash Joshi as the vital piece                of evidence is missing, because no evidence was placed                before the court to show on whose information the date                of birth of Hukmi Chand and the date of birth of Suraj                Prakash Joshi were recorded in the aforesaid document.                As already stated neither of the parents of the two                candidates nor any other person having special                knowledge about their date of birth was examined by                the respondent to prove the date of birth as mentioned                in the aforesaid documents. Parents or near relations                having special knowledge are the best persons to                depose about the date of birth of a person. If entry                regarding date of birth in the scholar's register is made                on the information given by parents or someone having                special knowledge of the fact, the same would have                probative value. The testimony of Anantram Sharma                and Kailash Chandra Taparia merely prove the                documents but the contents of those documents were                not proved. The date of birth mentioned in the scholars'                register has no evidentiary value unless the person who                made the entry or who gave the date of birth is                examined. The entry contained in the admission form or                in the scholar's register must be shown to be made on                the basis of information given by the parents or a                person having special knowledge about the date of                birth of the person concerned….”  18.   In Madan Mohan Singh, this Court held that the entries made in        the official record may be admissible under Section 35 of the                                                                               9 Indian Evidence Act, 1872 but the Court has a right to examine  their probative value.     The authenticity of the entries would  depend on whose information such entries stood recorded.             The  Court held as under:           “20. So far as the entries made in the official record by          an official or person authorised in performance of          official duties are concerned, they may be admissible          under Section 35 of the Evidence Act but the court has          a right to examine their probative value. The          authenticity of the entries would depend on whose          information such entries stood recorded and what was          his source of information. The entries in school          register/school leaving certificate require to be proved          in accordance with law and the standard of proof          required in such cases remained the same as in any          other civil or criminal cases.           21. For determining the age of a person, the best          evidence is of his/her parents, if it is supported by          unimpeachable documents. In case the date of birth          depicted in the school register/certificate stands belied          by the unimpeachable evidence of reliable persons and          contemporaneous documents like the date of birth          register of the Municipal Corporation, government          hospital/nursing home, etc., the entry in the school          register is to be discarded. (Vide Brij Mohan          Singh v. Priya Brat Narain Sinha [AIR 1965 SC          282] , Birad Mal Singhvi v. Anand Purohit [1988 Supp          SCC 604 : AIR 1988 SC 1796] , Vishnu v. State of          Maharashtra [(2006) 1 SCC 283 : (2006) 1 SCC (Cri)          217] and Satpal Singh v. State of Haryana [(2010) 8          SCC 714 : JT (2010) 7 SC 500] .)           22. If a person wants to rely on a particular date of          birth and wants to press a document in service, he has          to prove its authenticity in terms of Section 32(5) or          Sections 50, 51, 59, 60 and 61, etc. of the Evidence Act          by examining the person having special means of          knowledge, authenticity of date, time, etc. mentioned          therein. (Vide Updesh Kumar v. Prithvi Singh [(2001) 2          SCC 524 : 2001 SCC (Cri) 1300 : 2001 SCC (L&S) 1063]          and State of Punjab v. Mohinder Singh [(2005) 3 SCC          702 : AIR 2005 SC 1868].)”                                                                          10 19.      In a judgment reported as Ram Suresh Singh v. Prabhat Singh           & Anr.6, it has been held that entry in the School Register may not           be a public document and, thus, must be proved in accordance           with law. The Court held as under:                        “12. The condition laid down in Section 35 of the                       Evidence Act for proving an entry pertaining to the age                       of a student in a school admission register is to be                       considered for the purpose of determining the                       relevance thereof. But in this case, the said condition                       must be held to have been satisfied. An entry in a                       school register may not be a public document and,                       thus, must be proved in accordance with law, as has                       been held by this Court in Birad Mal Singhvi but in this                       case the said entry has been proved.”  20.      We find that the High Court gravely erred in law in interfering in           the findings of fact recorded by the First Appellate Court.             The           plaintiff has not challenged the release deed dated 15 th June, 1963           in the plaint on the ground that he was minor on the date of           execution nor has he challenged on the ground of fraud, coercion           or undue influence in execution of the said document. He has not           pleaded so as is required to be pleaded in terms of Order VI Rule 4           Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 7. The only pleading raised by the           plaintiff is that he was a minor at the time of death of his father in           1963. He has not disclosed the date of death of his father in the           plaint. The averment in the plaint is that his signatures have been           obtained on certain documents but he does not know the contents           thereof.  21.      There is a categorical plea in the written statement that the   6     (2009) 6 SCC 681 7     for short, ‘the Code’                                                                                    11       release deed was voluntarily executed and he walked away from        the family and stayed in the village of his father-in-law. The fact        that he left village and stayed in the house of his father-in-law is        admitted by him when he appeared as PW-1. The High Court has        also not disputed that a sum of Rs.5,000/- was received by him        when the release deed was executed on 15th June, 1963.  22.   The plaintiff has taken benefit of consideration of Rs.5,000/- in        pursuance of the release deed executed on 15 th June, 1963.          He        has not challenged such release deed in the suit filed but asserted        to be member of joint Hindu family though as per his own        evidence, he left joint family and started living in the Village of his        father-in-law.   Thereafter, on the basis of the release deed, the        other members of the family have transferred some of the property        in favour of the other defendants; therefore, the suit could not        have been decreed when the two registered documents (Ex.D/1        and Ex.D/2) are not disputed by the plaintiff when confronted with        such document in the cross-examination. 23.   We find that the onus was on the plaintiff to prove that he was a        minor at the time of execution of release deed. He failed to prove        his date of birth as 8 th April 1946, therefore, his suit is to be        dismissed and was rightly dismissed by the learned trial court and        the First Appellate Court. The High Court in Second Appeal could        not reappreciate the evidence to take a different view that such        document is proved. The illegality on account of alleged improper        consideration does not give rise to a substantial question of law. 24.   The plaintiff has admitted the release deed and the marriage deed                                                                             12         dated 15th June, 1963 and 29th June, 1964 respectively having been          executed by him when confronted with in his cross examination.          Both the documents are registered documents. On the basis of          admission, both courts have returned a finding of fact that the          plaintiff has not been able to prove date of birth as 8 th April, 1946.          We find that the High Court committed a grave error in interfering          in the second appeal by merely taking a different view on the basis          of same evidence on the basis of which both the trial court as well          as First Appellate Court held the plaintiff has failed to prove his          date of birth as 8th April 1946.  25.     The question as to whether a substantial question of law arises,          has been a subject matter of interpretation by this Court. In the          judgment reported as Karnataka Board of Wakf v. Anjuman-E-          Ismail Madris-Un-Niswan8, it was held that findings of the fact          could not have been interfered within the second appeal.                   This          Court held as under:                     “12. This Court had repeatedly held that the power of                    the High Court to interfere in second appeal under                    Section 100 CPC is limited solely to decide a substantial                    question of law, if at all the same arises in the case. It                    has deprecated the practice of the High Court routinely                    interfering in pure findings of fact reached by the courts                    below without coming to the conclusion that the said                    finding of fact is either perverse or not based on                    material on record.                     13. In Ramanuja Naidu v. V. Kanniah Naidu (1996 3 SCC                    392), this Court held:                           ""It is now well settled that concurrent findings of                          fact of trial court and first appellate court cannot be                          interfered with by the High Court in exercise of its  8     (1999) 6 SCC 343                                                                                       13                          jurisdiction under Section 100 of Civil Procedure                          Code. The Single Judge of the High Court totally                          misconceived his jurisdiction in deciding the second                          appeal under Section 100 of the Code in the way he                          did.""                     14. In Navaneethammal v. Arjuna Chetty (1996 6 SCC                    166), this Court held :                           ""Interference with the concurrent findings of the                          courts below by the High Court under Section 100                          CPC must be avoided unless warranted by com-                          pelling reasons. In any case, the High Court is not                          expected to reappreciate the evidence just to re-                          place the findings of the lower courts. … Even as-                          suming that another view is possible on a reappreci-                          ation of the same evidence, that should not have                          been done by the High Court as it cannot be said                          that the view taken by the first appellate court was                          based on no material.""                     15.      And again in Secy., Taliparamba Education Soci-                    ety v. Moothedath Mallisseri Illath M.N. (1997 4 SCC 484),                    this Court held: (SCC p. 486, para 5)                           ""The High Court was grossly in error in trenching                          upon the appreciation of evidence under Section                          100 CPC and recording reverse finding of fact which                          is impermissible.""  26.     In   a   judgment     reported   as   Kondiba     Dagadu      Kadam     v.          Savitkibai Sopan Gujar & Ors.9, this Court held that from a          given set of circumstances if two inferences are possible then the          one drawn by the lower appellate court is binding on the High          Court. In the said case, the First Appellate Court set aside the          judgment of the trial court. It was held that the High Court can          interfere if the conclusion drawn by the lower court was erroneous          being contrary to mandatory provisions of law applicable or if it is a          settled position on the basis of a pronouncement made by the  9     (1999) 3 SCC 722                                                                                  14         court or based upon inadmissible evidence or arrived at without          evidence. This Court held as under:                    “5.       It is not within the domain of the High Court to                   investigate the grounds on which findings were arrived                   at, by the last court of fact, being the first appellate                   court. It is true that the lower appellate court should not                   ordinarily reject witnesses accepted by the trial court in                   respect of credibility but even where it has rejected the                   witnesses accepted by the trial court, the same is no                   ground for interference in second appeal when it is                   found that the appellate court had given satisfactory                   reasons for doing so. In a case where from a given set                   of circumstances two inferences are possible, one                   drawn by the lower appellate court is binding on the                   High Court in second appeal. Adopting any other                   approach is not permissible. The High Court cannot                   substitute its opinion for the opinion of the first                   appellate court unless it is found that the conclusions                   drawn by the tower appellate court were erroneous                   being contrary to the mandatory provisions of law                   applicable of its settled position on the basis of                   pronouncements made by the apex Court, or was based                   upon in inadmissible evidence or arrived at without                   evidence.”  27.     In   another    judgment      reported     as    Santosh       Hazari   v.          Purushottam Tiwari10, this Court held as under:                   “14.     A point of law which admits of no two opinions                   may be a proposition of law but cannot be a substantial                   question of law. To be substantial, a question of law                   must be debatable, not previously settled by law of the                   land or a binding precedent, and must have a material                   bearing on the decision of the case, if answered either                   way, in so far as the rights of the parties before it are                   concerned. To be a question of law involving in the case                   there must be first a foundation for it laid in the                   pleadings and the question should emerge from the                   sustainable findings of fact arrived at by court of facts                   and it must be necessary to decide that question of law                   for a just and proper decision of the case. An entirely                   new point raised for the first time before the High Court                   is not a question involved in the case unless it goes to                   the root of the matter. It will, therefore, depend on the                   facts and circumstance of each case whether a question  10    (2001) 3SCC 179                                                                                  15                    of law is a substantial one and involved in the case, or                    not; the paramount overall consideration being the                    need for striking a judicious balance between the                    indispensable obligation to do justice at all stages and                    impelling necessity of avoiding prolongation in the life                    of any lis.”  28.     Recently in another judgment reported as State of Rajasthan v.          Shiv Dayal11, it was held that a concurrent finding of the fact is          binding, unless it is pointed out that it was reco"

(MD)                           No.64 of 2000, filed by the Appellant, but allowing the Second                           Appeal being S.A.

No.16/1998, to the extent the Signature Not Verified  Digitally signed by INDU MARWAH                          First Appellate Court had declined the Respondent’s claim to a Date: 2020.08.27 18:19:32 IST Reason:                           decree of recovery of possession of the suit premises. The High                                                                    2 Court held that the Respondent, being the Plaintiff in the suit  was entitled to a declaration of title in respect of half portion of  the suit premises, recovery of possession of the said half portion  of the suit premises and also to recovery of income from the  said half of the suit property owned by the Respondent and/or  charges for use, enjoyment and/or occupation thereof.    2.    The Appellant claims to be the owner of the suit premises,  being the building and premises at Door No.4 in R.S. No.120/13  at Mela Senia Street, Aduthurai, Tamil Nadu.    3.   According    to   the   Appellant,   the   Appellant’s   father  purchased the suit premises for valuable consideration, by a  registered deed of sale dated 17.2.1938. The Appellant claims  to have been in possession of the suit premises, as owner, from  the inception and not as tenant.     4.   In 1994, the Respondent, hereinafter referred to as the  ‘Respondent Plaintiff’, filed a suit being O.S. No.169/1994 in the  Court of the District Munsif, Valaingaiman at Kumbhakonam,  claiming declaration of ownership of the suit premises, a  direction on the Appellant, being the Defendant, to deliver  possession of the suit premises to the Respondent Plaintiff, a                                                                       3 decree       for   payment   of    Rs.900/-     towards   arrears    of  rent/occupation charges in respect of the suit premises, and a  decree for payment of future profits.    5.    In the plaint filed in the said suit, it has been alleged that  the   said     premises,   which   had   been    purchased   by     the  Respondent Plaintiff’s father, by a registered sale deed dated  17.9.1940, had originally been let out to the Appellant’s father  M. Abdul Aziz. After the death of M. Abdul Aziz, the tenancy  was attorned in the name of the Appellant, who agreed to pay  rent of Rs.25/- per month, and also the requisite Panchayat Tax.     6.    Alleging that the Appellant had been trying to set up title  in respect of the said premises, by applying for ‘Patta’ to the  Tahsildar Natham, and further alleging that the Appellant was in  arrears of rent to the tune of Rs.1225/- up to February, 1994, the  Respondent Plaintiff filed the aforesaid suit.     7.    In the suit, the Respondent Plaintiff inter alia claimed a  decree of Rs.900/- towards rent and/or occupation charges. The  Respondent Plaintiff restricted his claim to arrears of rent and/or  occupation charges to three years, as the claim to rent and/or  occupation charges for the earlier period, had become barred by                                                                      4 limitation, there being no acknowledgement of liability by the  Appellant-Defendant.   8.     The Appellant-Defendant filed his written statement in the  Suit, denying title and/or ownership of the Respondent Plaintiff  to the suit premises and also contending that the Appellant-  Defendant was not a tenant.       The Appellant-Defendant claimed  absolute ownership of the suit premises, which he claimed had  been purchased by his father, by a registered sale deed dated  17.2.1938, for valuable consideration.     9.     The Appellant-Defendant further contended that the suit  premises had all along, been assessed to tax in the name of the  Appellant-Defendant’s father, Abdul Aziz, and not in the name of  the Respondent Plaintiff or his father. The Appellant-Defendant  claimed to have got the suit premises from his father, under a  registered Deed of Release dated 14.3.1966.        According to the  Appellant-Defendant, he has, since 1966, owned and enjoyed  the suit premises, with absolute rights.     10.    The learned District Munsif (Trial Court) framed the  following three issues for adjudication in the said suit :-        (i)    Whether the Respondent Plaintiff was entitled to             declaration of title to the suit property and recovery                                                                    5            of possession of the suit property from the Defendant            (the Appellant in this Appeal)       (ii) Whether the Defendant (the Appellant herein) was a            tenant at the suit property or not;        (iii) To what other relief was the Respondent Plaintiff             entitled.   11.    By a judgment and decree dated 22.1.1998, the Trial Court  dismissed the said suit, holding that the Respondent Plaintiff  had failed to prove that the suit property had been purchased  by his father.      All the three issues were decided against the  Respondent Plaintiff.    12.    The Trial Court found that the Respondent Plaintiff had not  been able to produce any rent agreement, rent receipts or any  other oral or documentary evidence to establish that the  Appellant was a tenant at the said premises.         The Trial Court  held that the Respondent Plaintiff was not entitled to any relief  in the said suit.    13.    Being aggrieved by the said judgment and decree dated  22.1.1998 passed by the Trial Court, the Respondent Plaintiff  appealed     to     the   Subordinate   Court   at   Kumbhakonam,  hereinafter referred to as the ‘First Appellate Court’.    14.    By a judgment and order dated 17.9.1999, the First                                                                  6 Appellate Court allowed the said appeal, and set aside the said  judgment and order dated 22.1.1998 of the Trial Court , holding  that the Respondent Plaintiff was entitled to declaration of title  over half portion of the suit premises and also to recovery of  income, if any, from the said half portion of the suit premises  owned by the Respondent Plaintiff and/or charges for use,  occupation and/or enjoyment thereof, but not to recovery of  possession.     15.   The claim of the Respondent Plaintiff in the suit was based  on the assertion that one Rajagopala Pattar, who had purchased  the suit premises in a Court Auction, had sold the said premises  to the Respondent Plaintiff’s father in 1940.    16.   The First Appellate Court analyzed the oral evidence  adduced on behalf of the parties, scrutinized and examined the  documentary evidence on record, including in particular the  registered deed of conveyance by which the Respondent  Plaintiff’s father had purchased his portion of the suit premises  from Rajagopala Pattar (Exhibit P1), the registered documents  by which Rajagopala Pattar had acquired the suit premises in a  Court Auction (Exhibits P2 and P3) and the registered deed of  conveyance executed on 17.02.1938 being Exhibit D1 by which                                                                     7 the Appellant-Defendant’s father M. Abdul Aziz had purchased  his portion of the suit premises, examined the extent of the  rights of the respective vendors of the Appellant-Defendant’s  father   and   the   Respondent-Plaintiff’s   father   and/or   their  predecessors-in-interest, and concluded that the Appellant-  Defendant’s father had only purchased a portion of the suit  premises, not the entire suit premises, and the other portion  had been purchased by the Respondent-Plaintiff’s father.         The  First Appellate Court, therefore, held that the Respondent-  Plaintiff was entitled to a declaration in respect of the said  portion of the suit premises, purchased by his father.    17.   The First Appellate Court also took note of the fact that the  Appellant-Defendant’s family had been residing in the suit  property since 1940, and that the Respondent-Plaintiff had not  produced any rent agreement or receipts or any tax receipts in  respect of the suit premises to show that the Respondent-  Plaintiff or his father or any other family member had ever paid  any taxes in respect of the suit premises.   18.   The First Appellate Court concurred with the finding of the  Trial Court, that the Respondent-Plaintiff had failed to establish  that the said premises had been rented out to M. Abdul Aziz  father of the Appellant-Defendant.      On the other hand, the                                                                     8 Appellant had been in possession of and had been enjoying the  suit premises for a long time.      The First Appellate Court thus  found the Appellant liable to pay “backage income” in respect of  the portion of the suit property, of which the Respondent  Plaintiff was the owner.    19.   The First Appellate Court, in effect, held that the Appellant  was liable to make over to the Respondent Plaintiff, income if  any, derived from the said portion of the suit premises which  was owned by the Respondent Plaintiff and/or pay charges for  use, occupation and enjoyment of the portion of the suit  premises owned by the Respondent Plaintiff.    20.   The   First   Appellate   Court,   however,   held   that   the  Respondent Plaintiff was not entitled to recovery of possession  since the Respondent Plaintiff had failed to establish landlord-  tenant relationship between the Respondent Plaintiff and the  Appellant defendant, and that in any case the Appellant had  been in possession of the suit premises for a long time.    21.   The First Appellate Court passed a fair and just order,  holding that the Respondent-plaintiff, being the owner of a  portion of the said premises, was entitled to declaration of title                                                                  9 in respect of the said portion of the suit property owned by him,  but not to recovery of possession, since the defendant being the  Appellant herein had been enjoying the suit property for a long  time.     In effect and substance, the First Appellate Court found  that the relief of recovery of possession was barred by delay  and/or in other words the laws of limitation, although this has  not clearly been stated in the judgment and order of the First  Appellate Court.     22.     Being purportedly aggrieved by the reversal of the  judgment and decree of the Trial Court, dismissing the said suit,  the Appellant-Defendant filed a Second Appeal being S.A. No.  64/2000 in the Madras High Court, against the judgment of the  First Appellate Court. The Respondent Plaintiff also filed Second  Appeal No.558 of 2000 in the Madras High Court, against the  same judgment and decree dated 17.9.1999, to the extent the  Respondent Plaintiff had been denied the relief of delivery of  possession in respect of his half share in the suit premises.     23.     By the judgment and order of the High Court under appeal  before this Court, the Second Appeal No. 64 of 2000 filed by the  Appellant-Defendant has been dismissed, the Second Appeal  No.559 of 2000 filed by the Respondent Plaintiff has been                                                                    10 allowed and the judgment and decree of the First Appellate  Court set aside, to the extent the Respondent Plaintiff had been  denied the relief of recovery of possession in respect of half of  the suit premises.     The High Court held that the Respondent  Plaintiff was entitled to recovery of half of the plaint scheduled  property, after identifying the same with the help of an  Advocate Commissioner, at the time of the execution of the  decree.    In all other respects, the decree of the First Appellate  Court was confirmed.    24.    Section 100 of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC) which  provides for a Second Appeal, as amended by the Civil  Procedure     Code (Amendment) Act, 104 of 1976, with effect  from 1.2.1977,provides as follows:-        “100. Second Appeal. - (1) Save as otherwise expressly       provided in the body of this Code or by any other law for       the time being in force, an appeal shall lie to the High       Court from every decree passed in appeal by any Court       subordinate to the High Court, if the High Court is satisfied       that the case involves a substantial question of law.        (2) An appeal may lie under this section from an appellate       decree passed ex parte.        (3) In an appeal under this section, the memorandum of       appeal shall precisely state the substantial question of       law involved in the appeal.                                                                     11       (4) Where the High Court is satisfied that a substantial       question of law is involved in any case, it shall formulate       that question.        (5) The appeal shall be heard on the question so       formulated and the respondent shall, at the hearing of the       appeal, be allowed to argue that the case does not involve       such question:        Provided that nothing in this sub-section shall be deemed       to take away or abridge the power of the Court to hear,       for reasons to be recorded, the appeal on any other       substantial question of law, not formulated by it, if it is       satisfied that the case involves such question.]”   25.    A second appeal, or for that matter, any appeal is not a  matter of right. The right of appeal is conferred by statute. A  second appeal only lies on a substantial question of law. If  statute confers a limited right of appeal, the Court cannot  expand the scope of the appeal.          It was not open to the  Respondent-Plaintiff to re-agitate facts or to call upon the High  Court to reanalyze or re-appreciate evidence in a Second  Appeal.     26.    Section 100 of the CPC, as amended, restricts the right of  second appeal, to only those cases, where a substantial  question of law is involved.     The existence of a “substantial                                                                         12 question of law” is the sine qua non for the exercise of  jurisdiction under Section 100 of the CPC.  27.    The High Court framed the following Questions of law:-          “1. Whether the Lower Appellate Court is right in           refusing the relief of possession especially when the           Lower Appellate Court granted relief of mesne profits           till delivery of possession.?        2.   Whether the Lower Appellate Court is right in holding            that the plaintiff is entitled to a declaration in respect            of half of the suit property overlooking the pleadings            and the documents of title in the instant case?”   28.    On behalf of the Appellant-Defendant, it has strenuously  been contended, and in our view, with considerable force, that  there was no question of law involved in either of the second  appeals, far less any substantial question of law, to warrant  inference of the High Court in Second Appeal No. 64 of 2000.    29.    The principles for deciding when a question of law  becomes a substantial question of law, have been enunciated  by a Constitution Bench of this Court in Sir Chunilal v. Mehta  & Sons Ltd. v. Century Spg. & Mfg. Co. Ltd. 1, where this  Court held:-        ”The proper test for determining whether a question of       law raised in the case is substantial would, in our opinion,  1. AIR 1962 SC 1314                                                                       13       be whether it is of general public importance or whether       it directly and substantially affects the rights of the       parties and if so whether it is either an open question in       the sense that it is not finally settled by this Court or by       the Privy Council or by the Federal Court or is not free       from difficulty or calls for discussion of alternative views.       If the question is settled by the highest court or the       general principles to be applied in determining the       question are well settled and there is a mere question of       applying those principles or that the plea raised is       palpably absurd the question would not be a substantial       question of law.”  30.    In Hero Vinoth v. Seshammal2, this Court referred              to  and relied upon Chunilal v. Mehta and Sons (supra) and other  judgments and summarised the tests to find out whether a  given set of questions of law were mere questions of law or  substantial questions of law.    31.    The relevant paragraphs of the judgment of this Court in  Hero Vinoth (supra) are set out hereinbelow:-        “21. The phrase ”substantial question of law”, as       occurring in the amended Section 100 CPC is not defined       in the Code. The word substantial, as qualifying ”question       of law”, means of having substance, essential, real, of       sound worth, important or considerable. It is to be       understood as something in contradistinction with-       technical, of no substance or consequence, or academic       merely. However, it is clear that the legislature has       chosen not to qualify the scope of “substantial question of       law” by suffixing the words ”of general importance” as       has been done in many other provisions such as Section       109 of the Code or Article 133(1)(a) of the Constitution.       The substantial question of law on which a second appeal  2(2006) 5 SCC 545                                                                      14       shall be heard need not necessarily be a substantial       question of law of general importance. In Guran Ditta v.       Ram Ditta [(1927-28) 5I5 IA 235 : AIR 1928 PC 172] the       phrase substantial question of law as it was employed in       the last clause of the then existing Section 100 CPC (since       omitted by the Amendment Act, 1973) came up for       consideration and their Lordships held that it did not       mean a substantial question of general importance but a       substantial question of law which was involved in the       case. In Sir Chunilal case [1962 Supp (3) SCR 549 : AIR       1962 SC 1314] the Constitution Bench expressed       agreement with the following view taken by a Full Bench       of the Madras High Court in Rimmalapudi Subba Rao v.       Noony Veeraju [AIR 1951 Mad 969 : (1951) 2 MLJ 222       (FB)] : (Sir Chunilal case [1962 Supp (3) SCR 549 : AIR       1962 SC 1314] , SCR p. 557)        “When a question of law is fairly arguable, where there is       room for difference of opinion on it or where the Court       thought it necessary to deal with that question at some       length and discuss alternative views, then the question       would be a substantial question of law. On the other hand       if the question was practically covered by the decision of       the highest court or if the general principles to be applied       in determining the question are well settled and the only       question was of applying those principles to the particular       fact of the case it would not be a substantial question of       law.”  32.    To be “substantial”, a question of law must be debatable,  not previously settled by the law of the land or any binding  precedent, and must have a material bearing on the decision of  the case and/or the rights of the parties before it, if answered  either way.    33.    To be a question of law “involved in the case”, there must  be first, a foundation for it laid in the pleadings, and the                                                                    15 question should emerge from the sustainable findings of fact,  arrived at by Courts of facts, and it must be necessary to decide  that question of law for a just and proper decision of the case.    34.   Where no such question of law, nor even a mixed question  of law and fact was urged before the Trial Court or the First  Appellate Court, as in this case, a second appeal cannot be  entertained, as held by this Court in Panchagopal Barua v.  Vinesh Chandra Goswami3.    35.   Whether a question of law is a substantial one and  whether such question is involved in the case or not, would  depend on the facts and circumstances of each case.            The  paramount overall consideration is the need for striking a  judicious balance between the indispensable obligation to do  justice at all stages and the impelling necessity of avoiding  prolongation in the life of any lis. This proposition finds support  from Santosh Hazari v. Purushottam Tiwari4.    36.   In a Second Appeal, the jurisdiction of the High Court being  confined to substantial question of law, a finding of fact is not  open to challenge in second appeal, even if the appreciation of  3. AIR 1997 SC 1047 4(2001) 3 SCC 179                                                                       16 evidence is palpably erroneous and the finding of fact incorrect  as held in Ramchandra v. Ramalingam5.                 An entirely new  point, raised for the first time, before the High Court, is not a  question involved in the case, unless it goes to the root of the  matter.    37.    The principles relating to Section 100 CPC relevant for this  case may be summarised thus :        (i)   An inference of fact from the recitals or contents of a             document is a question of fact, but the legal effect of             the terms of a document is a question of law.             Construction of a document, involving the application             of any principle of law, is also a question of law.             Therefore, when there is misconstruction of a             document or wrong application of a principle of law in             construing a document, it gives rise to a question of             law.       (ii) The High Court should be satisfied that the case            involves a substantial question of law, and not a mere            question of law. A question of law having a material            bearing on the decision of the case (that is, a            question, answer to which affects the rights of parties            to the suit) will be a substantial question of law, if it is            not covered by any specific provisions of law or            settled legal principle emerging from binding            precedents, and, involves a debatable legal issue.       (iii) A substantial question of law will also arise in a             contrary situation, where the legal position is clear,             either on account of express provisions of law or             binding precedents, but the Court below has decided             the matter, either ignoring or acting contrary to such             legal principle. In the second type of cases, the             substantial question of law arises not because the law             is still debatable, but because the decision rendered   5 AIR 1963 SC 302                                                                      17           on a material question, violates the settled position of           law.       (iv) The general rule is, that High Court will not interfere            with the concurrent findings of the Courts below. But            it is not an absolute rule. Some of the well-recognised            exceptions are where (i) the courts below have            ignored material evidence or acted on no evidence;            (ii) the courts have drawn wrong inferences from            proved facts by applying the law erroneously; or (iii)            the courts have wrongly cast the burden of proof. A            decision based on no evidence, does not refer only to            cases where there is a total dearth of evidence, but            also refers to case, where the evidence, taken as a            whole, is not reasonably capable of supporting the            finding.   38.    With the greatest of respect to the High Court, neither of  the two questions framed by the High Court is a question of law,  far less a substantial question of law. There was no controversy  before the High Court with regard to interpretation or legal  effect of any document nor any wrong application of a principle  of law, in construing a document, or otherwise, which might  have given rise to a question of law.     There was no debatable  issue before the High Court which was not covered by settled  principles of law and/or precedents.     39.    It is nobody’s case that the decision rendered by the First  Appellate Court on any material question, violated any settled  question of law or was vitiated by perversity. It is nobody’s case  that the evidence taken as a whole does not reasonably support                                                                      18 the finding of the First Appellate Court, or that the First  Appellate Court interpreted the evidence on record in an absurd  and/or capricious manner. It is also nobody’s case that the First  Appellate Court arrived at its decision ignoring or acting  contrary to any settled legal principle.  40.   The First Appellate Court examined the evidence on record  at length, and arrived at a reasoned conclusion, that the  Appellant-Defendant was owner of a part of the suit premises  and the Respondent-Plaintiff was owner of the other part of the  suit premises. This finding is based on cogent and binding  documents       of   title,   including   the   registered   deeds   of  conveyance by which the respective predecessors-in-interest of  the Appellant-Defendant and Respondent-Plaintiff had acquired  title over the suit premises. There was no erroneous inference  from any proved fact. Nor had the burden of proof erroneously  been shifted.    41.   The second question of law, that is,            the question of  whether the First Appellate Court was right in holding that the  plaintiff was entitled to a declaration of title in respect of half of  the suit property, has, as observed above, been decided in  favour of the Respondent Plaintiff, based on            pleadings and  evidence.    The conclusion of the First Appellate Court, of the                                                                     19 entitlement of the Respondent Plaintiff to a declaration in  respect of his half share in the suit property does not warrant  interference in a second appeal.  42.    The first question framed by the High Court, that is, the  question of whether the Lower Court /Appellate Court was right  in refusing the Respondent Plaintiff relief of possession, when  the    Appellate   Court   had   granted   mesne   profits   to   the  Respondent Plaintiff, is based on the erroneous factual premises  that the First Appellate Court had granted mesne profits to the  Respondent Plaintiff, which the First Appellate Court had not  done.    43.    The first question is not at all a question of law, far less  any substantial question of law involved in the case. The High  Court held:-        “8.     Substantial Question of law No. 1:-       After declaring one half right in respect of the plaint       schedule property, the learned first appellate Judge has       refused the relief for recovery of possession on the       ground that the defendants have produced the       documents to show that they are in possession and       enjoyment of the property (Ex.B9 to B.32). There is no       pleadings in the written statement filed by the defendant       that he has prescribed title by way of adverse possession       in respect of the entire plaint schedule property. The       learned first appellate Judge at one place has rejected the       relief of delivery of recovery of possession in respect of       the suit property has granted mesne profit for three years       prior to the institution of the suit. Both the above said                                                                       20       findings are diametrically opposite to each other. Once       the recovery of possession is denied, then there is no       question of granting any mesne profit arises.           After       declaring one half right in the plaint schedule property in       favour of the plaintiff, the learned appellate Judge ought       to have granted recovery of possession also in respect of       one half share in the plaint schedule property. Both the       courts below have concurrently held that there is not       landlord-tenancy relationship between the plaintiff and       the defendant. Under such circumstances, there is no       question of mesne profit arises in this case. So far as the       refusal of the relief of recovery of possession in respect of       the half of the plaint schedule property by the learned       first appellate Judge, warrants interference from this       Court. Substantial Question of Law No.1 is answered       accordingly.        9.      In fine, the Second Appeal No.558 of 2000 is       allowed and the decree and judgment of the learned first       appellate Judge in A.S. No.16/1998 on the file of the Court       of Subordinate Judge, Kumbakonam is set aside in respect       of dismissal of the suit for recovery of possession in       respect of half of the plaint schedule property. The       plaintiff is entitled to recover half of the plaint schedule       property after identifying the same with the help of an       Advocate Commission at the time of execution of the       decree In other respects, the decree of the learned first       appellate Judge in A.S. No.16/1998 on the file of the Court       of Subordinate Judge, Kumbakonam is hereby confirmed.       Second Appeal No. 64 of 2000 is dismissed. No costs.       Consequently, connected miscellaneous petition is       closed.”  44.    The High Court, with greatest of respect, has patently  erred in its conclusion that there was contradiction in the  findings of the First Appellate Court, in that the First Appellate  Court had declined the Respondent Plaintiff the relief of delivery                                                                     21 of possession of the suit property but had granted the  Respondent Plaintiff mesne profits for three years, prior to the  institution of the suit.  45.   ‘Mesne profits’ are profits which a person in wrongful  possession of property might have derived, but would not  include profits due to improvements. There is no finding of the  Appellant-Defendant being in wrongful possession of any part of  the suit premises either by the Trial Court or by the First  Appellate Court. The First Appellate Court has, nowhere used  the expression ‘mesne profit’. What the High Court granted to  the Respondent-Plaintiff was in the nature of reimbursement of  profit derived by the Appellant by use, occupation and  enjoyment of the Respondent-Plaintiff’s portion of the suit  premises and/or in other words reimbursement of income from  the said portion of the suit premises or charges             for use,  occupation and enjoyment thereof.    46.   A decree of possession does not automatically follow a  decree of declaration of titl"

Nariman, J.                 1. Leave granted.                 2. An e-tender notice was issued on 06.01.2018 by the U.P. State                           Warehousing Corporation (“Corporation”) for unloading/loading of                           foodgrains/fertilizer bags from/into railway wagons, trucks etc., stacking Signature Not Verified  Digitally signed by R Natarajan Date: 2020.10.16                          the foodgrains/fertilizers in bags, bagging, weighment, standardisation, 15:17:08 IST Reason:                             cleaning    of     foodgrains/fertilizers   etc.   and     transporting   of                                                                                                     1   foodgrains/fertilizers etc. from Railway Station to Corporation godowns    or vice versa or transporting them from any place to any other place for    the Vindhyachal (Mirzapur) Region. Ten days later i.e. on 16.01.2018,    the said tender was cancelled by the Corporation due to “administrative    reasons”. On 01.04.2018, an e-tender was again published in the same    terms, and so far as the region Vindhyachal (Mirzapur) is concerned, it    was for the “appointment of Handling and Transport Contractor for food    grain in FCI and alleged material etc.” of the following depots/centres of    Uttar Pradesh for a period of two years:    Sl.

Technical bids for these four centres were opened on 17.04.2018. Price    bids of technically qualified bidders were then opened on 23.04.2018.    The price bids that were received, so far as these four centres were    concerned, were as follows:                                                                                    2                             “PEG Bhawanipur-I Centre     Serial No.   Bidder                                 Rate    1.

On 04.05.2018, the then Managing Director of the Corporation    cancelled the aforesaid tender apparently on the ground that it was    “impractical” to go ahead with such tender. As a result, on 01.06.2018,    for the same region, the aforesaid tender was reissued for the same    workable capacity and estimated annual value of the contract. It may be    added that each of these tenders were for a period of two years.                                                                                  3 5. Sudhir Kumar Singh, Respondent No.1 in the appeals arising out of    SLP (C) No. 5136 of 2020 and SLP (C) No. 7351 of 2020, was declared    as the successful bidder for the Bhawanipur-I centre, at the rate of 341%    ASOR, the other successful tenderers for Mirzapur, Bhawanipur-II and    Tendu (Sonbhadra) being at 314%, 338% and 290% ASOR respectively.    On 13.07.2018, an agreement was entered into between the Corporation    and Respondent No.1 for execution of the work under the tender, which    began on and from that day, and continued for a period of over one year.  6. Meanwhile, on 27.05.2019, two complaints were made by one Shri    Pramod Kumar Singh of the Purvanchal Trucker Owner’s Association to    the Principal Secretary of the State of U.P. regarding financial    irregularities that occurred in the issuance of the e-tender notice dated    01.06.2018. These complaints were then forwarded by the Principal    Secretary of the State of U.P. to the Managing Director of the    Corporation by a letter dated 30.05.2019. The said letter, insofar as    Respondent No.1 is concerned, read as follows:            “Shri Pramod Kumar Singh should analyse two enclosed           complaints dated 27.05.2019 of Truck Owners           Association wherein loss of Crores to Corporation is           shown due to serious financial irregularities caused in           handling and transport contracts in Vindhyanchal           Division.           xxx xxx xxx            Tendering was done in Vindhyanchal Division on           16.04.2018, wherein low rate of tenders were received.           Issued tenders are cancelled on 05.05.2018 without                                                                          4           telling any reason and tender of centres cancelled on           16.06.2018 were re-tendered wherein rates are too high           in new tenders than older one and by allotting work on           higher rates work is being done.            Kindly assure providing report within five days in respect           of aforesaid and in respect of all points mentioned in           enclosed letters.”  7. As a result of this letter, the Managing Director of the Corporation held    an ex parte enquiry into the matter, and insofar as Respondent No.1 was    concerned, the Managing Director went into the cancellation of the    previous tender dated 01.04.2018, and into the comparative details of    rates received for these four centres earlier, as compared to the rates of    the same tendered quantity of the tender dated 01.06.2018, and found    the latter rates to be extremely high. In his report dated 14.06.2019, he    therefore ultimately concluded:            “It is mentionable that cancellation of e-tendering           process      done      earlier  through     Advertisement           No.1.1001.23318 dated 01.04.2018 on the ground that           received minimum rates are impractical is not           acceptable in any circumstance. In this respect, for           getting e-tendering process done the committee           constituted at Division Level considered PEG Tendu           (Sonbhadra) Centre only as impractical whereas the           Head Office accepted it as it is in respect of all centres.           As far as question of hiding of fact regarding forfeiture of           security deposit by Uday Construction or application filed           for producing the same are concerned, then in this           respect it is to be known that Uday Construction applied           only    for     PEG     Tendu    through Advertisement           No.1.1001.23318 dated 01.04.2018. Therefore, on this           ground rejection of bids received for other centres was           prima facie not justified.”                                                                             5 8. Meanwhile, the Commissioner, Vindhyachal Mandal Mirzapur, also    conducted an ex parte investigation and found in his report dated    29.06.2019 as follows:           “1. State regional manager Sh. Madhukar Gupta has          mentioned in his letter no. R.BH.N/dated 26-05-2018          forwarded to State General Manager (finance) Uttar          Pradesh State Warehousing Corporation that committee          of e-tendering has been formed only for the purpose of          formalities. It is cleared from examining the paragraph          that formality has been done in the tender. On 12-07-          2018 the state manager gave the recommendation of          acceptance and on 13-07-2018 Uttar Pradesh State          Warehousing Corporation gave acceptance. On 13-07-          2018 Sh. Madhukar Gupta State Regional Manager,          Uttar Pradesh State Warehousing Corporation          Vindhyachal gave appointment order to the concerned          contractors. Hereby uncommon vigilance has been          shown in entire procedure.          2. Regional Manager, Uttar Pradesh State Warehousing          Corporation Sh. Anuj Shukla, computer consultant was          got involved by Sh. Madhukar Gupta which is not          appropriate. It is objectionable in keeping contract work          in bid is objection.          3. Condition was kept on to participate only to the          registered contractors which is objectionable. Due to,          only participation of registered contractor, no contest          took place amongst the contractors. Because of which          rate was obtained at manifold high rate. Whereby          damaged was caused to department.          4. Regional Manager in his letter no. R.B.N/284/dated          12-07-2018 which is addressed to Managing Director          Uttar Pradesh State Warehousing Corporation Lucknow.          For determined rate to 314 percent, 341 percent, 338          percent, and 290 percent at high rate conformation of          recommendation of appointment of regular contractors          have been given for work of Indian Fertilizer Corporation          Handling and Transport. It is mentioned that despite the          high rate from determined rate regional manager neither          any market survey was conducted regarding high rate                                                                      6          nor he mentioned in his letter and he recommended the          acceptance irresponsibly. Hence Sh. Madhukar Gupta          State Regional Manager has not followed his duty and          responsibility and he is responsible for high rate and          acceptance without any reason.          5. Even corporation Headquarter did not deem fit to take          any action regarding high rate from determined rate.          What was examined by Headquarter it is not cleared.          6. In this regard categorically it is not possible to          determine the financial loss since neither in this case,          opportunity to contest has been given and nor market          survey has been conducted. On the basis of that          formality rate can be determined. Damage has been          surely caused. But it cannot be explained. Record is          sent for perusal and necessary action.” 9. Given these two reports, the Special Secretary, Government of U.P.    wrote a letter dated 16.07.2019 to the Managing Director, in which the    Managing Director’s report dated 14.06.2019 was referred to, and    concluded:           “In this, the role of Officer of Regional Level          (Vindhyachal Division) and accepting Officer and          erstwhile Managing Director and officers concerned with          Headquarter, also appears to be doubtful.          So, I have been instructed to say that you by doing          enquiry of matter at your own level, the financial loss          caused to the Government and after evaluating the          same, shall take action to recover the said amount from          concerned Contractor and concerned Officers. The          Officers/Employees against whom any previous          departmental proceeding is pending, in respect of them          by including these charges as additional Charge Sheet          action shall be taken and against officers/employees          found guilty in the matter against whom no proceedings          are pending, proceeding shall be done by marking them.          The tenders of abovementioned firms which are granted          contrary to rules, by cancelling them the appointment of                                                                         7            contractors be done through e-tendering again for            handling and transport work of concerned Warehouses.            Said proceedings be done as soon as possible and the            action taken shall be informed to the Government.” 10. Pursuant to this letter, the aforesaid tenders were then cancelled on     26.07.2019, and disciplinary proceedings were taken against certain     employees of the Corporation. These proceedings led to a report dated     18.10.2019, in which the difference between the earlier rates and the     present rates were gone into, and it was found that an excess of INR     4,40,05,369 had been paid relative to what was sanctioned previously –     this amount being the financial loss suffered by the Corporation.  11. Meanwhile, Respondent No.1 filed Writ Petition no. 25389 of 2019 in     July 2019 before the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad, in which he     challenged the “illegal and arbitrary” termination of the contract with the     Corporation after successful completion of over one year of a two-year     term, and prayed for the setting aside of the Corporation’s cancellation     order dated 26.07.2019 of the tender dated 01.06.2018.  12. By the judgment dated 11.12.2019 in this Writ Petition, which is     impugned in the appeals arising out of SLP (C) No. 5136 of 2020 and     SLP (C) No. 7351 of 2020, the High Court, after setting out the prayer in     the Writ Petition, set out four questions that arose before it as follows:             “(a) Whether the two enquiry reports are procedurally            defective inasmuch as the findings returned thereunder            are based upon no material and hence perverse;                                                                                   8           (b) Whether the respondent Managing Director was           justified in cancelling the written agreement with the           petitioner after a lapse of a year, without putting him to           notice;            (c) Whether being an autonomous body, Corporation           could not have been directed to take action in particular           manner and Managing Director was not justified in           cancelling the agreement under an executive fiat of           Special Secretary; and;            (d) Whether the order passed by Managing Director is           vitiated for bias as he himself had been Inquiry Officer           and without inviting the petitioner to explain in his           defence he himself conducted the inquiry and then on           the basis of report prepared by him, he proceeded to           cancel the agreement.”  13. The High Court concluded that since the entire proceedings were    conducted behind the back of Respondent No.1, and considering that    the tender notice dated 01.06.2018 had never been challenged by    anybody in a court of law, an ex parte appraisal of the complaints    received was done in a hurry by the Managing Director of the    Corporation and the learned Commissioner, and was liable to be set    aside on several grounds, the single most important one – insofar as    Respondent No.1 is concerned – being the breach of natural justice. The    High Court, therefore, held:            “If the officials had cancelled the earlier tender notice in           their wisdom and the cancellation of those tender notice           was never questioned, merely because those earlier           tender notices were cancelled/ withdrawn, a necessary           presumption cannot be raised that the third notice           inviting tender was for some extraneous considerations.           It is true that the prices this time were taken to be very                                                                           9 high as against the earlier ones in the process of tender in which the prices were quoted very low but that does not itself become the ground to cancel the entire tender process which had not only been finalized but even the agreement had been entered into and the party under the contract was carrying out the work making huge investment of money. Had it been a case also of the kind where the party to the contract had violated the terms and conditions of the contract, it could have been said that the tender was liable to be cancelled for violation of terms and conditions of the tender agreement. But in the instant case no such finding has come to be returned. The reasons for which the tender proceedings that had already been concluded with the execution of the agreement, has been cancelled without assigning any reason of wrong practice adopted by the petitioner in obtaining the agreement. Thus the petitioner cannot be said to be at fault in the matter and, therefore, in our considered opinion if the petitioner was already working under the agreement and no charge was there that he violated the terms and conditions of the agreement, the respondents were not justified in cancelling the agreement ex parte. xxx xxx xxx  There is no finding returned that at the stage of submission of the application against the notice inviting tender, the petitioner was not eligible or that at the time of the opening of the technical bid and financial bid the petitioner got wrongfully qualified and that the financial bid of the petitioner was wrongly approved and that the agreement entered between the petitioner and the Corporation was void being against the law. If in all the above three stages the petitioner cannot be held to be guilty in any manner for manipulating the things and obtaining the tender by hatching any conspiracy in connivance with the officials of the Corporation, cancellation of the agreement suddenly by the Managing Director holding that the entire Notice Inviting Tender was bad, certainly required a notice and opportunity of hearing to be afforded to the petitioner prior to passing of such an order. It is a settled principle of law that in administrative exercise of power, the authority exercising                                                                10            power has to not only render due application of mind but            also to follow the procedure which would not render the            entire action arbitrary. It is settled legal principle that            whatever is arbitrary, is hit by Article 14 of the            Constitution of India and in the present case we find that            only the procedure that was followed by the respondents            in taking impugned action was not only quite ex parte            but also under the executive fiats of the Special            Secretary of the Government which was quite uncalled            for.”  14. Having so held, the High Court then concluded:             “Order impugned is basically based on the enquiry            report prepared by the Managing Director himself and            that the enquiry was conducted in the ex parte manner            and the Managing Director failed to offer any opportunity            of hearing to the petitioner before passing the order            impugned which has the effect of terminating the            agreement for no justifiable reason to hold that the            petitioner was at fault at any point of time. Element of            bias therefore, under the circumstances at the end of            Managing Director, cannot be ruled out. The order            impugned, therefore, terminating the agreement dated            26.7.2019 cannot be sustained in law.             Thus, for the forgoing discussions writ petition succeeds            and is allowed. The order dated 26.7.2019 (Annexure-            13) to the writ petition and the enquiry report dated            14.6.2019 submitted by the Managing Director as well            as the order passed by the Special Secretary dated            16.7.2019 are also hereby quashed.             The consequential action if taken pursuant to the            impugned order is also quashed. The consequences to            follow, however, there will be no order as to costs.”  15. Dr. Abhishek Manu Singhvi, learned Senior Advocate appearing on     behalf of the Corporation, first adverted to the prayer in the Writ Petition     filed by Respondent No.1, and argued that the High Court had gone way                                                                               11 beyond what was asked for. According to him, the Writ Petition only  prayed for a quashing of the cancellation order dated 26.07.2019 of the  second tender. The High Court went way beyond, and not only quashed  the aforesaid cancellation, but also quashed the enquiry report of the  Managing Director dated 14.06.2019, as well as the order passed by the  Special Secretary dated 16.07.2019, and the consequential action taken,  namely, the departmental proceedings against the delinquent officers,  which was never the subject matter of challenge in the Writ Petition. He  went on to argue, based upon the comparison between the rates that  were received in the earlier tender dated 01.04.2018 that was cancelled,  and the rates in the 01.06.2018 tender, that the disparity was so great as  to make it clear that the contracts for these four centres ought not to  have been entered into at these rates at all. He argued that the High  Court ought to have appreciated the huge financial loss that was caused  as a result of awarding the contract at these rates, and ought not to have  interfered with the cancellation of the tender, as it could not be  characterised as arbitrary, given the huge increase in rates in such a  short period for the same works. Further, he argued that the case law on  natural justice showed that it was not an inflexible straitjacket, but had to  be used wisely and well, and cited a number of judgments of this Court  for the proposition that even though natural justice may be breached in  the facts of a given case, if otherwise such breach does not result in                                                                            12    prejudice, it would be a mere exercise in futility to set aside the order     and remand it to the authorities to pass an order after hearing the     affected party. He also argued that as of today, the two year term of the     contract is over, and this very contractor, i.e. Respondent No.1, is doing     the same work awarded at Mirzapur on 21.03.2020 at rates (139%     ASOR) which are much lower than the rates tendered for previously, as     is the successful tenderer Tilotama Devi on and from 31.09.2019 so far     as Bhawanipur-II is concerned, which was awarded at 221% ASOR. Dr.     Singhvi also argued that the writ court ought not to have interfered in     contractual matters, and ought to have left Respondent No.1 to     approach a civil court to file a suit for appropriate reliefs.  16. Shri Tushar Mehta, learned Solicitor General appearing on behalf of the     State of U.P., argued that he had a limited role, and confined his     arguments to the setting aside of the letter dated 16.07.2019 of the     Special Secretary to take departmental action. He argued that this letter     could not have been set aside by the High Court, as no such prayer or     argument was made before it by the writ petitioner.  17. Shri Rakesh Dwivedi, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of     Respondent No.1, argued that the High Court judgment ought not to be     interfered with, inasmuch as his client had pumped in a lot of money, and     had worked the contract for a period of over one year successfully and     without any complaint whatsoever from the Corporation. He reiterated                                                                            13 the fact that nobody had challenged the award of the tender to his client,  and that the cancellation of the tender was done behind his client’s back.  Had the authorities bothered to give his client a hearing, his client could  have pointed out that in other nearby divisions, tenders were awarded at  roughly the same rates, all of which contracts had been worked out, and  none of which have been cancelled. Thus, he argued that his client  suffered serious prejudice, in that he was able to work his contract for  only one out of the two years that was awarded to him. He further  argued that had a hearing been given, his client would also have  demonstrated that the rates that were awarded could not be  characterised as unreasonable, given the magnitude of the contract in  his favour. He also argued that the award of tender at a lower rate at  Mirzapur, which is currently being processed through his client, is not  comparable with the tender that was awarded to his client for  Bhawanipur I, because, inter alia, there was a huge difference between  the volume of work awarded in the two contracts. He argued that it is idle  to say that no prejudice has been caused, inasmuch as he has not been  able to work the contract for one year, the contract period now being  over, and that if the contract with his client is set aside, his client is  debarred from bidding for a period of three years for any other contract  with the Corporation. He further argued, in support of the impugned High  Court judgment, that the action of termination by the Corporation was                                                                          14    without an independent application of mind, and was purely at the     instruction of the Special Secretary of the Government of U.P. dated     16.07.2019. He also fairly argued that his statement may be recorded     that his client is not going to claim damages for the period of the     agreement post cancellation, and that in fairness, the earnest money     deposit and security deposit made by his client ought to be returned by     the Corporation.  18. Having heard learned counsel for all the parties, one thing becomes     clear. Despite the fact that the prayer in the Writ Petition filed by     Respondent No.1 was set out in the very beginning of the impugned     judgment, confining itself to the cancellation of the second tender, the     impugned judgment went ahead and not only set aside such cancellation     vide the letter dated 26.07.2019, but also went ahead and set aside the     Managing Director’s report dated 14.06.2019, and the Special     Secretary’s order of 16.07.2019, which required the taking of disciplinary     action and recovery of financial loss from those who are responsible.     Shri Rakesh Dwivedi also fairly conceded that his client had not asked     for any relief qua the delinquent officers. This being the case, we set     aside the impugned judgment insofar as it has quashed the Managing     Director’s report dated 14.06.2019, and the order of the Special     Secretary dated 16.07.2019. Any consequential action that is to be taken     pursuant to these orders must follow in accordance with law.                                                                            15 19. Dr. Singhvi’s preliminary objection as to Respondent No.1 having to     approach a civil court, and not a writ court, for actions that pertain to     breach of contract, need not detain us. In ABL International Ltd. and     Anr. v. Export Credit Guarantee Corporation of India Ltd. and Ors.     (2004) 3 SCC 553, this Court held that it was no longer res integra that a     writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution is maintainable at the     instance of an aggrieved party to enforce a contractual obligation of the     State or its instrumentality when the State acts in an arbitrary manner, as     follows:                “8. As could be seen from the arguments addressed in               this appeal and as also from the divergent views of the               two courts below, one of the questions that falls for our               consideration is whether a writ petition under Article 226               of the Constitution of India is maintainable to enforce a               contractual obligation of the State or its instrumentality,               by an aggrieved party.               9. In our opinion this question is no more res integra and               is settled by a large number of judicial pronouncements               of this Court. In K.N. Guruswamy v. State of               Mysore [(1955) 1 SCR 305] this Court held:               “20. The next question is whether the appellant can               complain of this by way of a writ. In our opinion, he could               have done so in an ordinary case. The appellant is               interested in these contracts and has a right under the               laws of the State to receive the same treatment and be               given the same chance as anybody else. …               We would therefore in the ordinary course have given               the appellant the writ he seeks. But, owing to the time               which this matter has taken to reach us (a consequence               for which the appellant is in no way to blame, for he has               done all he could to have an early hearing), there is               barely a fortnight of the contract left to go…A writ would               therefore be ineffective and as it is not our practice to                                                                             16 issue meaningless writs we must dismiss this appeal and leave the appellant content with an enunciation of the law.” 10. It is clear from the above observations of this Court in the said case, though a writ was not issued on the facts of that case, this Court has held that on a given set of facts if a State acts in an arbitrary manner even in a matter of contract, an aggrieved party can approach the court by way of writ under Article 226 of the Constitution and the court depending on facts of the said case is empowered to grant the relief. This judgment in K.N. Guruswamy v. State         of    Mysore was        followed subsequently by this Court in the case of D.F.O. v. Ram Sanehi Singh [(1971) 3 SCC 864] wherein this Court held: “By that orde"

Respondent (s)                       JUDGMENT   L. NAGESWARA RAO, J.   1.   Respondent No.2 in the above Appeals lodged a  complaint which was registered under Sections 148, 120 B,  302 read with Section 149 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860  (IPC) at Karimnagar Rural Police Station vide FIR No.155  dated 19.04.2019. It was alleged in the complaint that the  husband of Respondent No.2, Bojja Thirupathi was the  Chairman   of   the   Fishermen       Co-operative   Society   of  Chamanapalli village, Karimnagar District. Members of the  Society alone were permitted to carry out fishing activities  in the tanks in Rajasamudram and Appanapalli villages.  The membership of the Appellants in the Fishermen Co-                                      1 operative Society was cancelled due to which they were  not permitted to carry out fishing activities.            Three years  before the complaint the husband of Respondent No.2 was  attacked by the Appellants at the village Panchayat office  and a criminal case was registered against the Appellants,  which was pending.            On 19.04.2019, the husband of  Respondent No.2 went to Chamanapalli village to inspect  the tank. At about 5.00 pm, the Appellants attacked the  husband        of   Respondent    No.2        with   stones   and    he  succumbed to the injuries.   2.     The Appellants moved applications for bail before the  Principal Sessions Judge, Karimnagar who summoned the  case    diary,      statements   of     the   witnesses    and    other  connected records. The Principal Sessions Judge released  the Appellants on bail by imposing conditions that the  Appellants shall appear before the Karimnagar Rural Police  Station on every alternative day between 10.00 am to  05.00 pm and shall not leave the territorial jurisdiction of  the    First    Additional   Judicial     Magistrate,     First   Class,  Karimnagar.         Another condition was imposed that the  Appellants shall not influence or tamper with the evidence.                                                                         2 | Page 3.    Respondent No.2 filed a petition for cancellation of  bail under Section 439(2) Cr. P.C. before the High Court for  the State of Telangana.      On 10.07.2019, a charge sheet  was filed against the Appellants. According to the charge  sheet, all the accused gathered and planned to kill Bojja  Thirupathi on 19.04.2019.         They formed into two groups.  The first group, consisting of A5, A7 to A11 and A15,  attacked the deceased and remaining persons were  standing guard near the tank.             Even according to the  charge sheet, there is no overt act alleged against any of  the   accused,     except   A6     who     is    alleged    to     have  strangulated the deceased with a towel.   4.    We are informed at the bar that the case has been  committed    for   trial.    The    High        Court    allowed    the  applications filed for cancellation of bail on the ground that  the Principal Sessions Judge did not consider the material  available on record before granting bail to the Appellants.  The High Court further held that the criminal antecedents  of the Appellants were not taken into account by the trial  Court.    That     apart,   the    High    Court        accepted    the  submissions on behalf of Respondent No.2 that the                                                                         3 | Page Appellants indulged in threatening the witnesses after  being released on bail.   5.   The Appellants contended that no specific overt act  was attributed to any of the accused, except for omnibus  allegations made against them.       It is argued that the  complaint that was made by Respondent No.2 is on the  basis of vague allegations regarding tampering with the  evidence. The Appellants urged that the order passed by  the High Court is liable to be set aside as there were no  compelling reasons for interfering with the order of the  Sessions Court by which they were released on bail.   6.   The factors to be considered while granting bail have  been held by this Court to be the gravity of the crime, the  character of the evidence, position and status of the  accused with reference to the victim and witnesses, the  likelihood of the accused fleeing from justice and repeating  the offence, the possibility of his tampering with the  evidence and witnesses, and obstructing the course of  justice etc.   Each criminal case presents its own peculiar  factual scenario and, therefore, certain grounds peculiar to  a particular case may have to be taken into account by the  Court.   The court has to only opine as to whether there is                                                           4 | Page prima facie case against the accused. For the purpose of  bail, the Court must not undertake meticulous examination  of the evidence collected by the police and comment on  the same.1   7.    In Raghubir Singh v. State of Bihar2 this Court  held that bail can be cancelled where (i) the accused  misuses his liberty by indulging in similar criminal activity,  (ii) interferes with the course of investigation, (iii) attempts  to tamper with evidence or witnesses, (iv) threatens  witnesses or indulges in similar activities which would  hamper smooth investigation, (v) there is likelihood of his  fleeing to another country, (vi) attempts to make himself  scarce by going underground or becoming unavailable to  the investigating agency, (vii) attempts to place himself  beyond the reach of his surety, etc.             The above grounds  are illustrative and not exhaustive. It must also be  remembered that rejection of bail stands on one footing  but cancellation of bail is a harsh order because it  interferes with the liberty of the individual and hence it  must not be lightly resorted to.     1 Kanwar Singh Meena vs State of Rajasthan & Anr. (2012) 12 SCC 180 2 (1986) 4 SCC 481                                                                         5 | Page 8.    It is trite law that cancellation of bail can be done in  cases where the order granting bail suffers from serious  infirmities resulting in miscarriage of justice. If the court  granting bail ignores relevant material indicating prima  facie involvement of the accused or takes into account  irrelevant material, which has no relevance to the question  of grant of bail to the accused, the High Court or the  Sessions Court would be justified in cancelling the bail3.  9.    Having perused the law laid down by this Court on  the scope of the power to be exercised in the matter of  cancellation of bails, it is necessary to examine whether  the order passed by the Sessions Court granting bail is  perverse and suffers from infirmities which has resulted in  the miscarriage of justice.          No doubt, the Sessions Court  did not discuss the material on record in detail, but there is  an indication from the orders by which bail was granted  that the entire material was perused before grant of bail.  It is not the case of either the complainant-Respondent  No.2 or the State that irrelevant considerations have been  taken into account by the Sessions Court while granting  bail to the Appellants.       The order of the Sessions Court by  which the bail was granted to the Appellants cannot be   3 Kanwar Singh Meena vs State of Rajasthan & Anr. (supra).                                                                 6 | Page termed as perverse as the Sessions Court was conscious of  the fact that the investigation was completed and there  was no likelihood of the Appellant tampering with the  evidence.   10. The petition filed for cancellation of bail is both on  the grounds of illegality of the order passed by the  Sessions    Court   and   the   conduct   of   the   Appellants  subsequent to their release after bail was granted.        The  complaint filed by one Bojja Ravinder to the Commissioner  of Police, Karimnagar is placed on record by Respondent  No.2. It is stated in the complaint that the Appellants were  roaming freely in the village and threatening witnesses.  We have perused the complaint and found that the  allegations made therein are vague.       There is no mention  about which accused out of the 15 indulged in acts of  holding out threats to the witnesses or made an attempt to  tamper with the evidence.   11. After considering the submissions made on behalf of  the parties and examining the material on record, we are  of the opinion that the High Court was not right in  cancelling the bail of the Appellants. The orders passed by  the Sessions Judge granting bail cannot be termed as                                                               7 | Page perverse. The complaint alleging that the Appellants were  influencing witnesses is vague and is without any details  regarding the involvement of the Appellants in threatening  the witnesses. Therefore, the Appeals are allowed and the  judgment of the High Court is set aside.                                    ….................................J.                                  [L.

Leave granted.    2.      Yashita Sahu (hereinafter referred to as the wife) and  Varun Varma (hereinafter referred to as the husband), got  married on 30.05.2016 in India.     The husband was already  working in the United States of America (hereinafter referred to  as the USA). The wife accompanied the husband to the USA on  17.07.2016. A daughter named Kiyara Verma, was born to the                                 1 couple on 03.05.2017.            She is a citizen of the USA.             The  relationship between the husband and the wife got strained and  they made various allegations and counter allegations against  each other. The wife applied for an Emergency Protection Order  on 25.08.2018 to the Norfolk Juvenile and Domestic Relations  District Court (hereinafter referred to as the Norfolk Court),  praying for her protection and an ex parte preliminary protection  order   was     passed     against    the   husband.        Thereafter,   on  29.08.2018, the wife instituted a petition in the same Court  seeking sole custody of the minor child. She also filed a petition  praying that the husband be directed to give monetary support to  her and the minor child. The said Court passed an order on  26.09.2018 in terms of the agreement reached between the  parties.     This agreement is part of the order and reads as  follows:­             “Father to continue paying rent and utilities @ the            marital residence for October, 2018 and November, 2018.            Father will add mother to lease as an authorized            occupants or leaseholder.        Father to pay mother            150/week for child support for October and November,            2018/ and 200/week for December, 2018. Parties to            work together to reach a resolution as to who will            continue occupy the martial residence after November,            2018. Mother to look for employment consistent with her            educational and professional experience. Mother and            father have joint legal custody of minor child and shared            physical custody of child father’s parenting time to start                                         2         Thursday September, 27, 2018 @ noon until Saturday         September 29, 2018 @ noon. Thereafter, the parties are         to share parenting time as follows :          mother to have child every other week from Saturday @         noon until Wednesday @ noon and in alternating weeks         from Saturday @ noon until Tuesday @ noon. Father         shall have parenting time on Wednesday @ noon until         Saturday with alternating weeks two @ noon until         Saturday @ noon (i.e. 4 days on, 3 days off switching         weeks for each parent) parents shall allow whatsapp         calling with child with custodial parent at least 5 min.         per evening upon reasonable notice to other parent.         Parents shall use a third neutral party to facilitate         exchanging the child. Parties shall corporate with each         other & third party if noon exchange time is not feasible         all parties will surrender their passports, including         child’s passport, to guardian ad liten. Mother to reside @         marital residence until December 1, 2018 wherein         mother will vacate the premises or assume full         responsibility of the rent and utilities thereafter.”    As per this order, amongst other things the husband was to add  the wife as an authorised lease holder in the rented premises and  he was to pay weekly support to the child @ $150 per week for  the months of October and November, 2018 and $200 per week  for the month of December, 2018.            Joint, legal custody and  shared physical custody of the child was given to the parents,  with each parent being given individual parenting time. As per  the agreement the child was also permitted to talk to the other  parent by WhatsApp calling, after reasonable notice.                 It is  important to note that it was clearly mentioned that the parties  shall cooperate with each other and try to reach an amicable                                      3 settlement with the help of a neutral third party. If a settlement  was not possible then they were to surrender their passports  including the child’s passport to the guardian ad litem. The wife  was directed to reside in the marital residence till December 1,  2018, whereafter she had to vacate the premises or assume full  responsibility of the rent and utilities.   3.     It is not disputed before us that the wife, along with the  child left the USA and came to India on 30.09.2018 i.e. after  26.09.2018 and before 01.10.2018, which was the next date fixed  before the Norfolk Court.   4.     The husband on coming to know of the fact that his wife,  along with their child had left the USA for India, filed a motion for  emergency relief before the Norfolk Court on 02.10.2019. An ex  parte order was passed in favour of the husband whereby the  Norfolk Court granted sole legal and physical custody of the child  to the husband and directed the wife to return to the USA along  with the child. A warrant was also issued against the wife for  violating the order dated 26.09.2018 of the Norfolk Court.   5.     The husband also filed a petition for issuance of a writ of  habeas corpus before the Rajasthan High Court for production of                                     4 his minor child.    The High Court by the impugned judgment  dated 01.07.2019 directed the wife to return to the USA along  with her minor daughter within a period of 6 weeks to enable the  jurisdictional court in USA to pass further orders in this regard  in the proceedings already pending. The husband was directed  to make all arrangements for the stay and travel of the wife and  the minor child and any companion. It was further directed that  in case the wife was not willing to stay in the house of the  husband, then the petitioner­husband would make alternative  arrangements for her stay at the place of her choice at a  reasonable cost.   6.     Aggrieved by this judgment of the Rajasthan High Court,  the wife has filed the present appeal.   7.     We have heard Ms. Malvika Rajkotia, learned counsel for  the appellant and Mr. Prabhjit Jauhar, learned counsel for the  respondents, at length.    Various contentions have been raised  before us by both sides. It has been contended by Ms. Rajkotia  that a writ of habeas corpus would not lie for the custody of the  child since she could not be said to be in illegal detention, as the  child was in the custody of the mother who is the natural                                    5 guardian. She also contended that the High Court erred in giving  a direction to the wife to travel to the USA. Her next contention  is that the child is only about 2 ½ years old and moreover being a  girl­child requires the care, attention and protection of the  mother and, therefore, it is in the interest of the child to be  placed in custody of the mother. With regard to the proceedings  before the Norfolk Court in the USA, it is contended that the wife  was unable to comprehend the proceedings before the Norfolk  Court because of lack of knowledge of English and that too  spoken in an American accent. She also submitted that the legal  aid provided to the wife was of a lawyer who was a ‘caucasian  male’, implying that there was lack of communication between  the two. It is also contended that the wife had raised objection to  the alleged consent order vide e­mail dated 28.09.2018. She also  submits that the order passed by the Norfolk Court is not binding  on the parties, especially the wife and, in the larger interest of the  child the writ petition filed by the husband before the Rajasthan  High Court should have been dismissed. It was also contended  by Ms. Rajkotia that the husband is working in the USA on the  basis of a work permit which is only valid till 2020 and the future                                      6 of the wife and the child will be in jeopardy in case his visa/work  permit is not extended.   8.     On the other hand, Mr. Jauhar, contends that it was the  wife who approached the Court in Norfolk and, by agreement, an  order was passed giving shared parenting to both the parents.  The wife had been specifically directed neither to leave the USA  nor take the child out of the USA, but she has violated the orders  of the jurisdictional court, which jurisdiction was invoked by the  wife herself. According to him the wife cannot be permitted to  violate the orders passed by a court in another country and then  seek protection in the Indian courts. He also submitted that in  this modern age it is a well recognised principle of parenting that  even a father can be an appropriate natural guardian for the  minor daughter. Lastly, he submitted that the husband is not  interested in divorcing the wife and his intention is to live with  the child and the wife. He also urged that the husband is willing  to make all arrangements for stay and travel for the wife and the  child, if the wife comes to the USA along with the child.     Whether a writ of habeas corpus is maintainable?                                   7 9.       It is too late in the day to urge that a writ of habeas  corpus is not maintainable if the child is in the custody of  another parent. The law in this regard has developed a lot over a  period of time but now it is a settled position that the court can  invoke its extraordinary writ jurisdiction for the best interest of  the child.       This has been done in Elizabeth Dinshaw vs.  Arvand M. Dinshaw & Ors.1, Nithya Anand Raghavan vs.  State (NCT of Delhi) & Anr. 2 and Lahari Sakhamuri vs.  Sobhan Kodali3 among others. In all these cases the writ  petitions were entertained. Therefore, we reject the contention of  the appellant­wife that the writ petition before the High Court of  Rajasthan was not maintainable.   10.      We need not refer to all decisions in this regard but it  would be apposite to refer to the following observations from the  judgment in Nithya Anand Raghavan (supra):­              “46. The High Court while dealing with the petition for            issuance of a writ of habeas corpus concerning a minor            child, in a given case, may direct return of the child or            decline to change the custody of the child keeping in            mind all the attending facts and circumstances including            the settled legal position referred to above. Once again,            we may hasten to add that the decision of the court, in  1 (1987) 1 SCC 42 2 (2017) 8 SCC 454 3 (2019) 7 SCC 311                                        8           each case, must depend on the totality of the facts and           circumstances of the case brought before it whilst           considering the welfare of the child which is of           paramount consideration. The order of the foreign court           must yield to the welfare of the child. Further, the remedy           of writ of habeas corpus cannot be used for mere           enforcement of the directions given by the foreign court           against a person within its jurisdiction and convert that           jurisdiction into that of an executing court. Indubitably,           the writ petitioner can take recourse to such other           remedy as may be permissible in law for enforcement of           the order passed by the foreign court or to resort to any           other proceedings as may be permissible in law before the           Indian Court for the custody of the child, if so advised.            47. In a habeas corpus petition as aforesaid, the High           Court must examine at the threshold whether the minor           is in lawful or unlawful custody of another person           (private Respondent named in the writ petition)…”     11.      Further, in the case of Kanika Goel vs. State of Delhi4, it  was held as follows:             “34. As expounded in the recent decisions of this Court,           the issue ought not to be decided on the basis of rights of           the parties claiming custody of the minor child but the           focus should constantly remain on whether the factum of           best interest of the minor child is to return to the native           country or otherwise. The fact that the minor child will           have better prospects upon return to his/her native           country, may be a relevant aspect in a substantive           proceedings for grant of custody of the minor child but           not decisive to examine the threshold issues in a habeas           corpus petition. For the purpose of habeas corpus           petition, the Court ought to focus on the obtaining           circumstances of the minor child having been removed           from the native country and taken to a place to encounter           alien environment, language, custom, etc. interfering with           his/her overall growth and grooming and whether           continuance there will be harmful…” 4 (2018) 9 SCC 578                                        9 12.    In the present case since the wife brought the minor to  India in violation of the orders of the jurisdictional court in USA,  her custody of the child cannot be said to be strictly legal.  However, we agree with the learned counsel for the appellant that  the High Court could not have directed the appellant­wife to go to  the USA. The wife is an adult and no court can force her to stay  at a place where she does not want to stay. Custody of a child is  a different issue, but even while deciding the issue of custody of a  child, we are clearly of the view that no direction can be issued to  the adult spouse to go and live with the other strained spouse in  writ jurisdiction.   Comity of Courts  13.    In the fast shrinking world where adults marry and shift  from one jurisdiction to another there are increasing issues of  jurisdiction as to which country’s courts will have jurisdiction. In  many cases the jurisdiction may vest in two countries. The issue  is important and needs to be dealt with care and sensitivity.  Though the interest of the child is extremely important and is, in  fact, of paramount importance, the courts of one jurisdiction  should respect the orders of a court of competent jurisdiction                                   10 even if it is beyond its territories. When a child is removed by  one parent from one country to another, especially in violation of  the orders passed by a court, the country to which the child is  removed must consider the question of custody and decide  whether the court should conduct an elaborate enquiry on the  question of child’s custody or deal with the matter summarily,  ordering the parent to return the custody of the child to the  jurisdiction from which the child was removed, and all aspects  relating to the child’s welfare be investigated in a court in his/her  own country.   14.    Reference in this regard may be made to the judgment in  Elizabeth Dinshaw (supra) wherein this Court was dealing with  a case where the wife was an American citizen whereas the  husband was a citizen of India. They got married in America and  a child was born to them in the year 1978. In 1980, differences  arose between the couple and the wife filed a petition for divorce.  The jurisdictional court in America had dissolved the marriage by  a decree of divorce on 23.04.1982 and by the same decree it was  directed that the wife would have the care, custody and control of  the child till he reaches the age of 18 years. The husband was                                    11 given visitation rights.        Taking advantage of the weekend  visitation rights, the husband picked up the child from school on  11.01.1986 and brought him to India. The wife filed a petition  under Article 32 of the Constitution of India before this Court.  Not only was the petition entertained, but the same was allowed  and we would like to refer to certain important observations of  this Court in Para 8:           “8. Whenever a question arises before a court pertaining         to the custody of a minor child, the matter is to be         decided not on considerations of the legal rights of parties         but on the sole and predominant criterion of what would         best serve the interest and welfare of the minor. We have         twice interviewed Dustan in our chambers and talked         with him. We found him to be too tender in age and         totally immature to be able to form any independent         opinion of his own as to which parent he should stay         with. The child is an American citizen. Excepting for the         last few months that have elapsed since his being         brought to India by the process of illegal abduction by the         father, he has spent the rest of his life in the United         States of America and he was doing well in school there.         In our considered opinion it will be in the best interests         and welfare of Dustan that he should go back to the         United States of America and continue his education         there under the custody and guardianship of the mother         to whom such custody and guardianship have been         entrusted by a competent court in that country. We are         also satisfied that the petitioner who is the mother, is full         of genuine love and affection for the child and she can be         safely trusted to look after him, educate him and attend         in every possible way to his proper upbringing. The child         has not taken root in this country and he is still         accustomed and acclimatized to the conditions and         environments obtaining in the place of his origin in the         United States of America. The child’s presence in India is         the result of an illegal act of abduction and the father         who is guilty of the said act cannot claim any advantage         by stating that he has already put the child in some                                       12           school in Pune. The conduct of the father has not been           such as to inspire confidence in us that he is a fit and           suitable person to be entrusted with the custody and           guardianship of the child for the present.”     In V. Ravi Chandran (Dr.) (2) vs. Union of India (UOI) and  Ors.5 it was held as follows:             “29. While dealing with a case of custody of a child           removed by a parent from one country to another in           contravention of the orders of the court where the parties           had set up their matrimonial home, the court in the           country to which child has been removed must first           consider the question whether the court could conduct           an elaborate enquiry on the question of custody or by           dealing with the matter summarily order a parent to           return custody of the child to the country from which the           child was removed and all aspects relating to child's           welfare be investigated in a court in his own country.           Should the court take a view that an elaborate enquiry is           necessary, obviously the court is bound to consider the           welfare and happiness of the child as the paramount           consideration and go into all relevant aspects of welfare of           child including stability and security, loving and           understanding care and guidance and full development of           the child's character, personality and talents. While doing           so, the order of a foreign court as to his custody may be           given due weight; the weight and persuasive effect of a           foreign judgment must depend on the circumstances of           each case.           30. However, in a case where the court decides to           exercise its jurisdiction summarily to return the child to           his own country, keeping in view the jurisdiction of the           court in the native country which has the closest concern           and the most intimate contact with the issues arising in           the case, the court may leave the aspects relating to the           welfare of the child to be investigated by the court in his           own native country as that could be in the best interest of           the child….”     5 (2010) 1 SCC 174                                        13 15.    In Nithya Anand Raghavan (supra), this Court took the  following view:­           “42. The consistent view of this Court is that if the child         has been brought within India, the courts in India may         conduct: (a) summary inquiry; or (b) an elaborate inquiry         on the question of custody. In the case of a summary         inquiry, the court may deem it fit to order return of the         child to the country from where he/she was removed         unless such return is shown to be harmful to the child.         In other words, even in the matter of a summary inquiry,         it is open to the court to decline the relief of return of the         child to the country from where he/she was removed         irrespective of a pre­existing order of return of the child         by a foreign court. In an elaborate inquiry, the court is         obliged to examine the merits as to where the paramount         interests and welfare of the child lay and reckon the fact         of a pre­existing order of the foreign court for return of         the child as only one of the circumstances. In either case,         the crucial question to be considered by the court (in the         country to which the child is removed) is to answer the         issue according to the child’s welfare. That has to be done         bearing in mind the totality of facts and circumstances of         each case independently. Even on close scrutiny of the         several decisions pressed before us, we do not find any         contra view in this behalf. To put it differently, the         principle of comity of courts cannot be given primacy or         more weightage for deciding the matter of custody or for         return of the child to the native State.”  Thereafter, another bench of this Court in Lahari Sakhamuri  (supra), while interpreting the judgment in Nithya Anand  Raghavan (supra) held as follows :­           “41…the doctrines of comity of courts, intimate connect,         orders passed by foreign courts having jurisdiction in the         matter regarding custody of the minor child, citizenship         of the parents and the child etc., cannot override the         consideration of the best interest and the welfare of the         child and the direction to return the child to the foreign                                        14         jurisdiction must not result in any physical, mental,         psychological, or other harm to the child.”  16.    We are of the considered view that the doctrine of comity  of courts is a very healthy doctrine. If courts in different  jurisdictions do not respect the orders passed by each other it  will lead to contradictory orders being passed in different  jurisdictions. No hard and fast guidelines can be laid down in  this regard and each case has to be decided on its own facts. We  may however again reiterate that the welfare of the child will  always remain the paramount consideration.     Welfare of the child – the paramount consideration  17.    It is well settled law by a catena of judgments that while  deciding matters of custody of a child, primary and paramount  consideration is welfare of the child.     If welfare of the child so  demands then technical objections cannot come in the way.  However, while deciding the welfare of the child it is not the view  of one spouse alone which has to be taken into consideration.  The courts should decide the issue of custody only on the basis  of what is in the best interest of the child.                                       15 18.      The child is the victim in custody battles. In this fight of  egos and increasing acrimonious battles and litigations between  two spouses, our experience shows that more often than not, the  parents who otherwise love their child, present a picture as if the  other spouse is a villain and he or she alone is entitled to the  custody of the child. The court must therefore be very vary of  what is said by each of the spouses.   19.      A child, especially a child of tender years requires the  love, affection, company, protection of both parents. This is not  only the requirement of the child but is his/her basic human  right. Just because the parents are at war with each other, does  not mean that the child should be denied the care, affection, love  or protection of any one of the two parents. A child is not an  inanimate object which can be tossed from one parent to the  other.   Every separation, every re­union may have a traumatic  and psychosomatic impact on the child. Therefore, it is to be  ensured that the court weighs each and every circumstance very  carefully before deciding how and in what manner the custody of  the child should be shared between both the parents. Even if the  custody is given to one parent the other parent must have                                     16 sufficient visitation rights to ensure that the child keeps in touch  with the other parent and does not lose social, physical and  psychological contact with any one of the two parents. It is only  in extreme circumstances that one parent should be denied  contact with the child. Reasons must be assigned if one parent is  to be denied any visitation rights or contact with the child.  Courts dealing with the custody matters must while deciding  issues of custody clearly define the nature, manner and specifics  of the visitation rights.   20.   The concept of visitation rights is not fully developed in  India. Most courts while granting custody to one spouse do not  pass any orders granting visitation rights to the other spouse. As  observed earlier, a child has a human right to have the love and  affection of both the parents and courts must pass orders  ensuring that the child is not totally deprived of the love,  affection and company of one of her/his parents. 21. Normally, if the parents are living in the same town or area,  the spouse who has not been granted custody is given visitation  rights over weekends only. In case the spouses are living at a  distance from each other, it may not be feasible or in the interest  of the child to create impediments in the education of the child                                   17 by frequent breaks and, in such cases the visitation rights must  be given over long weekends, breaks, and holidays. In cases like  the present one where the parents are in two different continents  effort should be made to give maximum visitation rights to the  parent who is denied custody. 22. In addition to ‘Visitation Rights’, ‘Contact rights’ are also  important for development of the child specially in cases where  both parents live in different states or countries. The concept of  contact rights in the modern age would be contact by telephone,  e­mail or in fact, we feel the best system of contact, if available  between the parties should be video calling. With the increasing  availability of internet, video calling is now very common and  courts dealing with the issue of custody of children must ensure  that the parent who is denied custody of the child should be able  to talk to her/his child as often as possible. Unless there are  special circumstances to take a different view, the parent who is  denied custody of the child should have the right to talk to  his/her child for 5­10 minutes everyday. This will help in  maintaining and improving the bond between the child and the  parent who is denied custody.     If that bond is maintained the  child will have no difficulty in moving from one home to another                                   18 during vacations or holidays. The purpose of this is, if we cannot  provide one happy home with two parents to the child then let  the child have the benefit of two happy homes with one parent  each.   23.     As far as the present case is concerned, keeping in view  what we have held above, we are not going into various  allegations and counter allegations made by both the spouses.  However, we record the statement of the husband that he has no  intention of divorcing his wife. We can only hope that the couple  can either by themselves or through mediation settle their  disputes which would not only be in their own interest but also  in the interest of Kiyara. Having said so, since at this stage the  dispute between them remains unresolved we shall list out the  factors and weigh them in a proper manner to see what is best in  the interest of the child:­   24.     Age of the child – the child is less than 3 years old. She  is a girl and, therefore, there can be no manner of doubt that she  probably requires her mother more than her father.      This is a  factor in favour of the wife.                                     19 25.    Nationality of the child ­ The child is a citizen of USA by  birth. Her father was already working in the USA when he got  married. We are told that the mother had visited the USA once  before marriage and when she got married it was done with the  knowledge that she may have to settle down there. The child was  born in a hospital in the USA and the mother did not come back  to India for delivery which indicates that at that time the parents  wanted the child to be a citizen of USA.     Since the child is a  citizen of USA by birth and holds a passport of that country,  while deciding the issue of custody we have to take this factor  into consideration.   26.    Proceedings in the Norfolk Court ­ It is the wife who  approached the court of competent jurisdiction, i.e. Norfolk  Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court, in the USA. She  first applied for an emergency order and also instituted a petition  seeking sole legal and physical custody of the child.    After the  husband put in appearance on the basis of the agreement, a  consent order was passed which directed both the parties to live  in the matrimonial home till 01.12.2018. It further directed that  if the matter could not be settled by that date then the wife would                                   20 make her own arrangements for residence etc.         Provision was  also made for shared parenting. The wife in total violation of the  said order brought the child back to India.   27.     We are not in agreement with the contention raised on  behalf of the wife that she could not understand the order of  the Norfolk Court. This is not the first time that the wife had  approached the court. The wife is educated. She was working  in Walmart in the USA.      She had contacted an NGO and on  09.09.2017     had   sent   an   e­mail   to   Parsipanny   Police  Department against her husband.            On 03.05.2018, the  husband obtained an emergency protection order against the  wife.     Thereafter, the wife along with the minor daughter  returned to India on 16.05.2018 and went back to the USA on  16.07.2018. The complaint filed by the husband is said to have  been dismissed on 26.07.2018. On 25.08.2018 the wife called  the Police as according to her she was scared for her safety and  that of her minor daughter. According to her she applied for an  emergency protective order on 25.08.2"

Aggrieved by the order of the High Court reducing the           compensation awarded by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal from           the sum of Rs.11,66,800/­ to Rs.4,14,000/­, the parents of the           deceased­accident victim have come up with the above appeal.            3. Signature Not Verified                          We have heard the learned counsel for the appellants and the Digitally signed by SATISH KUMAR YADAV Date: 2020.01.13 17:12:52 IST            learned counsel for the Insurance Company. Reason: 4.   Admittedly, the son of the appellants who was aged about 23  years, died on 7.09.2008 as a result of the injuries sustained in a road  traffic accident that took place on 5.09.2008. It appears that the  victim was one of the 2 pillion riders on a motor cycle and he was  thrown off the vehicle when a car hit the motor cycle from behind.  The Motor Accident Claims Tribunal found that the accident was  caused due to the rash and negligent driving of the car. This finding  was confirmed by the High Court, though with a rider that the victim  was also guilty of contributory negligence, in as much as there were 3  persons on the motor cycle at the time of the accident, requiring a  reduction of 10% of the compensation awarded.   5.   On the question of quantum of compensation, the appellants  claimed that their son was aged 23 years at the time of the accident  and that he was employed in a proprietary concern on a monthly  salary of Rs.9600/­. The employer was examined as PW­2 and the  certificate issued by him was marked as Ex.P­1/8. Finding no reason  to disbelieve the testimony of PW­2, the Tribunal applied a multiplier  of 18 and arrived at a sum of Rs.10,36,800/­ towards loss of  dependency, after deducting 50% of the salary towards personal  expenses, as the deceased victim was a bachelor. In addition, the                                      2 Tribunal also allowed a sum of Rs.1,00,000/­ for loss of love and  affection;    Rs.20,000/­   for        the   performance      of   last    rites   and  Rs.10,000/­ towards loss of Estate. Accordingly, the Tribunal arrived  at an amount of Rs.11,66,800/­ as the total compensation payable.   6.    As against the said award, the Insurance Company filed a  statutory appeal under Section 173 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988.  The appeal was primarily on two grounds namely (i) that the deceased  was guilty of contributory negligence inasmuch as he was riding on  the pillion of the motor cycle with two other persons and (ii) that the  employment and income of the deceased were not satisfactorily  established.   7.    On the first ground, the High Court held that though the motor  cycle in which the deceased victim was riding was hit by the speeding  car from behind, the deceased was also guilty of contributory  negligence, as he was riding a motor cycle with two other persons.  Therefore, the High Court came to the conclusion that an amount  equivalent     to   10%   has     to    be       deducted   towards       contributory  negligence.   8.    On the second issue, the High Court held that the employer did  not produce any records to substantiate the quantum of salary paid to                                              3 the deceased and that therefore the income of the deceased may have  to be assessed only on the basis of minimum wages, payable to  unskilled workers at the relevant point of time. Accordingly the High  Court fixed the income of the deceased at the time of the accident as  Rs.3683/­ per month, which was the minimum wages for unskilled  workers at that time.   9.     Insofar as the issue of multiplier is concerned, the High Court  applied the multiplier of 14 instead of the multiplier of 18, on the  basis of the ratio laid down by this Court in UPSRTC Vs. Trilok  Chandra1, to the effect that the choice of the multiplier should go by  the age of the deceased or that of the claimants, whichever is higher.  As a result, the High Court took Rs.3,683/­ as the monthly income,  allowed a deduction of 50% on the same towards personal expenses,  applied a multiplier of 14 and arrived at an amount of Rs.3,10,000/­.  The award of Rs.1,00,000/­ towards loss of love and affection granted  by the Tribunal was confirmed by the High Court but the amount of  Rs.10,000/­ each awarded towards funeral expenses and loss of  Estate were enhanced to Rs.25,000/­ each.     1 (1996) 4 SCC 362                                    4 10.   Thus, the High Court arrived at a total amount of Rs.4,60,000/­  (Rs.3,10,000/­ towards loss of dependency; Rs.1,00,000/­ towards  loss of love and affection; Rs.25000/­ towards funeral expenses and  Rs.25,000/­ towards loss of Estate). Out of the said amount, the High  Court deducted 10% towards contributory negligence and fixed the  compensation    payable   at   Rs.4,14,000/­   (Rs.4,60,000/­   minus  Rs.46,000/­). Aggrieved by this drastic reduction in the quantum of  compensation, the claimants are before us.   11.   As could be seen from the above narration, the High Court  interfered with the award of the Tribunal, on 3 counts, namely (i)  contributory negligence; (ii) monthly income of the deceased and (iii)  the multiplier to be applied. Therefore, let us see whether the High  Court was right in respect of each of these counts.   12.   It is seen from the material on record that the accident occurred  at about 2:00 a.m. on 5.09.2008. Therefore, there was no possibility  of heavy traffic on the road. The finding of fact by the Tribunal, as  confirmed by the High Court, was that the motor cycle in which the  deceased was travelling, was hit by the car from behind and that  therefore it was clear that the accident was caused by the rash and  negligent driving of the car. In fact, the High Court confirms in                                     5 paragraph 4 of the impugned order that the motor cycle was hit by the  car from behind. But it nevertheless holds that 3 persons on a motor  cycle could have added to the imbalance. The relevant portion of  paragraph 4 of the order of the High Court reads as follows:              “On careful assessment of the evidence led, this Court            finds substance in the plea of the insurance company.            While it is correct that the offending car had no            business to strike from behind against the motor­cycle            moving ahead of it, even if the motor cycle was            changing lane to allow another vehicle to overtake, the            fact that a motor vehicle meant for only two persons to            ride was carrying, besides the driver, two persons on            the pillion would undoubtedly have added to the            imbalance.”   13.   But the above reason, in our view, is flawed. The fact that the  deceased was riding on a motor cycle along with the driver and  another, may not, by itself, without anything more, make him  guilty of contributory negligence. At the most it would make him  guilty of being a party to the violation of the law. Section 128 of the  Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, imposes a restriction on the driver of a two­  wheeled motor cycle, not to carry more than one person on the motor  cycle. Section 194­C inserted by the Amendment Act 32 of 2019,  prescribes a penalty for violation of safety measures for motor cycle  drivers and pillion riders. Therefore, the fact that a person was a  pillion rider on a motor cycle along with the driver and one more                                     6 person on the pillion, may be a violation of the law. But such violation  by itself, without anything more, cannot lead to a finding of  contributory negligence, unless it is established that his very act of  riding along with two others, contributed either to the accident or to  the impact of the accident upon the victim. There must either be a  causal connection between the violation and the accident or a  causal connection between the violation and the impact of the  accident upon the victim. It may so happen at times, that the  accident could have been averted or the injuries sustained could have  been of a lesser degree, if there had been no violation of the law by the  victim. What could otherwise have resulted in a simple injury, might  have resulted in a grievous injury or even death due to the violation of  the law by the victim. It is in such cases, where, but for the  violation of the law, either the accident could have been averted  or the impact could have been minimized, that the principle of  contributory negligence could be invoked. It is not the case of the  insurer that the accident itself occurred as a result of three persons  riding on a motor cycle. It is not even the case of the insurer that the  accident would have been averted, if three persons were not riding on  the motor cycle. The fact that the motor cycle was hit by the car from                                      7 behind, is admitted. Interestingly, the finding recorded by the Tribunal  that the deceased was wearing a helmet and that the deceased was  knocked down after the car hit the motor cycle from behind, are all  not assailed. Therefore, the finding of the High Court that 2 persons  on the pillion of the motor cycle, could have added to the imbalance, is  nothing but presumptuous and is not based either upon pleading or  upon the evidence on record. Nothing was extracted from PW­3 to the  effect that 2 persons on the pillion added to the imbalance.   14.   Therefore, in the absence of any evidence to show that the  wrongful act on the part of the deceased victim contributed either to  the accident or to the nature of the injuries sustained, the victim  could not have been held guilty of contributory negligence. Hence the  reduction   of   10%   towards   contributory   negligence,    is   clearly  unjustified and the same has to be set aside.   15.   The second issue on which the High Court reversed the finding  of the tribunal, related to the employment of the deceased and the  monthly income earned by him. According to the claimants, the  deceased was aged 23 years at the time of the accident and he was not  even a matriculate. But he was stated to have been employed in a  proprietary concern named M/s Chandra Apparels on a monthly                                     8 salary of Rs.9600/­. The sole proprietor of the concern was examined  as PW­2 and the salary certificate was marked as Ex.PW­1/8. The  Tribunal which had the benefit of recording the evidence and which  consequently had the benefit of observing the demeanour of the  witness, specifically recorded a finding that there was no reason to  discard the testimony of PW­2.   16.   But unfortunately the High Court thought that the employer  should have produced salary vouchers and other records including  income tax returns, to substantiate the nature of the employment and  the monthly income. On the ground that in the absence of other  records, the salary certificate and the oral testimony of the employer  could not be accepted, the High Court proceeded to take the minimum  wages paid for the unskilled workers at the relevant point of time as  the benchmark.   17.   But we do not think that the approach adopted by the High  court could be approved. To a specific question in cross­examination,  calling upon PW­2 to produce the salary vouchers, he seems to have  replied that his business establishment had been wound up and that  the records are not available. This cannot be a ground for the High  Court to hold that the testimony of PW­2 is unacceptable.                                    9 18.    The High Court ought to have appreciated that the Court of first  instance was in a better position to appreciate the oral testimony. So  long as the oral testimony of PW­2 remained unshaken and hence  believed by the Court of first instance, the High Court ought not to  have rejected his evidence. After all, there was no allegation that PW­2  was set up for the purposes of this case. There were also no  contradictions in his testimony. As against the testimony of an  employer supported by a certificate issued by him, the High Court  ought not to have chosen a theoretical presumption relating to the  minimum wages fixed for unskilled employment. Therefore, the  interference made by the High Court with the findings of the Tribunal  with regard to the monthly income of the deceased, was uncalled for.   19.    Coming to the last issue relating to the multiplier, the Tribunal  applied the multiplier of 18, on the basis of the age of the deceased at  the time of the accident. But the High Court applied a multiplier of 14  on the ground that the choice of the multiplier should depend either  upon the age of the victim or upon the age of the claimants, whichever  is higher. According to the High court, this was the ratio laid down in  General Manager, Kerala SRTC Vs Susamma Thomas2 , and that    2 (1994) 2 SCC 176,                                    10 the same was also approved by a three Member Bench of this Court in  UPSRTC Vs. Trilok Chandra (supra).   20.   The High Court also noted that the choice of the multiplier with  reference to the age of the deceased alone, approved in Sarla Verma  & Ors. Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation & Anr. 3, was found  acceptance in two subsequent decisions namely (1) Reshmi Kumari  & Ors. Vs. Madan Mohan & Anr.4 and (2) Munna Lal Jain Vs.  Vipin Kumar Sharma5. But the High court thought that the  decisions in Susamma Thomas and Trilok Chandra were directly on  the point in relation to the choice of the multiplier and that the issue  as envisaged in those 2 decisions was neither raised nor considered  nor adjudicated upon in Sarla Verma. According to the High court, the  impact of the age of the claimants, in cases where it is found to be  higher than that of the deceased, did not come up for consideration in  Reshma Kumari and Munnal Lal Jain. Therefore, the High court  thought that it was obliged to follow the ratio laid down in Trilok  Chandra.     3 (2009) 6 SCC 121 4 (2013) 9 SCC 65 5 JT 2015 (5) SC 1                                   11 21.   But unfortunately the High Court failed to note that the decision  in Susamma Thomas was delivered on 06­01­1993, before the  insertion of the Second Schedule under Act 54 of 1994. Moreover  what the Court was concerned in Susamma Thomas was whether the  multiplier   method   involving the      ascertainment of   the   loss   of  dependency propounded in Davies v. Powell (1942) AC 601 or the  alternative method evolved in Nance v. British Columbia Electric  Supply Co. ltd (1951) AC 601 should be followed.   22.   Trilok Chandra merely affirmed the principle laid down in  Susamma Thomas that the multiplier method is the sound method of  assessing compensation and that there should be no departure from  the multiplier method on the basis of section 110B of the 1939 Act.  Trilok Chandra also noted that the Act stood amended in 1994 with  the introduction of section 163A and the second schedule. Though it  was indicated in Trilok Chandra (in the penultimate paragraph) that  the selection of the multiplier cannot in all cases be solely dependent  on the age of the deceased, the question of choice between the age of  the deceased and the age of the claimant was not the issue that arose  directly for consideration in that case.                                         12 23.   But Sarla Verma, though of a two member Bench, took note of  Susamma as well as Trilok Chandra and thereafter held in paragraphs  41 and 42 as follows:                “41. Tribunals/ courts adopt and apply different            operative multipliers. Some follow the multiplier with            reference to Susamma Thomas [set out in Column (2) of            the table above]; some follow the multiplier with            reference to Trilok Chandra, [set out in Column (3) of the            above]; some follow the multiplier with reference to            Charlie [set out in Column (4) of the table above]; many            follow the multiplier given in the second column of the            table in the Second Schedule of the MV Act [extracted in            column (5) of the table above]; and some follow the            multiplier actually adopted in the Second schedule            while calculating the quantum of compensation [set out            in column (6) of the table above]. For example, if the            deceased is aged 38 years, the multiplier would be 12            as per Susamma Thomas, 14 as per Trilok Chandra, 15            as per Charlie, or 16 as per the multiplier given in            Column (2) of the Second schedule to the MV Act or 15            as per the multiplier actually adopted in the second            schedule to the MV Act. some Tribunals as in this case,            apply the multiplier of 22 by taking the balance years of            service with reference to the retiring age. It is necessary            to avoid this kind of inconsistency. We are concerned            with cases falling under section 166 and not under            section 163A of the MV Act. in cases falling under            section 166 of the MV Act Davies methods is applicable.             42. We therefore hold that the multiplier to be used            should be as mentioned in Column (4) of the Table            above (prepared by applying Susamma Thomas, Trilok            Chandra and Charlie), which starts with an operative            multiplier of 18 (for the age groups of 15 to 20 and 21 to            25 years), reduced by one unit for every 5 years, that is            M­17 for 26 to 30 years, M­16 to 31 to 35 years, M­15            for 36 to 40 years, M­14 for 41 to 45 years and M­13 for            46 to 50 years, then reduced by 2 units for every 5                                        13              years, i.e., M­11 for 51 to 55 years, M­9 for 56 to 60              years, M­7 for 61 to 65 years, M­5 for 66 to 70 years.”   24.   What     was ultimately recommended in Sarla Verma, as seen  from para 40 of the judgment, was a multiplier, arrived at by  juxtaposing Susamma Thomas, Trilok Chandra and Charlie6 with the  multiplier mentioned in the Second Schedule.   25.   However when Reshma Kumari v. Madan Mohan came up for  hearing before a two member Bench, the Bench thought that the  question whether the multiplier specified in the second schedule  should be taken to be a guide for calculation of the amount of  compensation in a case falling under section 166, needed to be  decided by a larger bench, especially in the light of the defects pointed  out in Trilok Chandra in the Second Schedule. The three member  Bench extensively considered Trilok Chandra and the subsequent  decisions and approved the Table provided in Sarla Verma. It was held  in para 37 of the report in Reshma Kumari that the wide variations in  the selection of multiplier in fatal accident cases can be avoided if  Sarla Verma is followed.     6 (2005) 10 SCC 720                                      14 26.   In Munna Lal Jain, which is also by a bench of three Hon’ble  judges, the Court observed in para 11 as follows:               “ Whether the multiplier should depend on the age             of the dependents or that of the deceased has             been hanging fire for sometime: but that has been             given a quietus by another three judge bench in             Reshma Kumari. It was held that the multiplier is to             be used with reference to the age of the deceased. One             reason appears to be that there is certainty with regard             to the age of the deceased, but as far as that of             dependents is concerned, there will always be room for             dispute as to whether the age of the eldest or youngest             or even the average etc is to be taken.”   27.   In the light of the above observations, there was no room for any  confusion and the High Court appears to have imagined a conflict  between Trilok Chandra on the one hand and the subsequent  decisions on the other hand.   28.   It may be true that an accident victim may leave a 90 year old  mother as the only dependent. It is in such cases that one may  possibly attempt to resurrect the principle raised in Trilok Chandra.  But as on date, Munna Lal Jain, which is of a larger Bench, binds us  especially in a case of this nature.   29.   Thus, we find that the High Court committed           a serious error  (i) in holding the victim guilty of contributory negligence (ii) in rejecting                                          15 the evidence of PW­2 with regard to the employment and monthly  income of the deceased and (ii) in applying the multiplier of 14 instead  of 18. Therefore, the appeal is allowed and the impugned order of the  High Court is set aside. The award of the Tribunal shall stand  restored. There shall be no order as to costs.                                             …..…………....................J                                           (N.V.

Leave granted.            2.              The appellant assails his conviction under sections 376, 323           and 341 of the Indian Penal Code (in short, “IPC”) sentencing him           to seven years, one year and one month respectively with fine and           a default stipulation.     Signature Not Verified           3. Digitally signed by R Natarajan                          The prosecutrix, PW9 lodged FIR No. 25 of 1999 on Date: 2020.09.28 16:28:48 IST Reason:            13.04.1999 alleging that four years ago the appellant had                                                      1 outraged her modesty at the point of a knife. He had since been  promising to marry her and on that pretext continued to  establish physical relations with her as husband and wife. She  had also stayed at his house for fifteen days during which also he  established physical relations with her. Five days prior to the  lodging of the F.I.R, the appellant had established physical  relations with her on 09.04.1999. The appellant had cheated her  as now he was going to solemnise his marriage with another girl  on 20.04.1999. All efforts at a compromise had failed.  4.   The   Additional     Judicial   Commissioner,   Ranchi     on  consideration of the evidence convicted the appellant holding that  the prosecutrix was 14 years of age when the appellant had first  committed rape upon her at the point of a knife.         He did not  abide by his promise to marry her. The High Court dismissing  the appeal opined that the letters written by the appellant to the  prosecutrix, their photographs together, and the statement of the  appellant recorded under Section 313 Cr.P.C. were sufficient to  sustain the conviction.                                      2 5.   Learned senior counsel, Mrs. V. Mohana on behalf of the  appellant, submits that the F.I.R lodged belatedly after four years  was clearly an afterthought. The entire genesis of the allegations  is highly doubtful and suspect as the prosecutrix in her cross­  examination admitted that the appellant had not committed rape  with her on 09.04.1999. The letters written by the appellant to  the prosecutrix as also those written by her to the appellant  marked    as   Exhibits   during       trial,   more   than   sufficiently  established a deep love affair between them over a period of time.  The prosecutrix was aged approximately 25 years as opined by  P.W.10, the Doctor who medically examined her on 14.04.1999.  The physical relations between the appellant and the prosecutrix  were consensual in nature occasioned by their love affair.             No  offence under Section 375 IPC is therefore, made out.                The  questions put to the appellant under Section 313 Cr.P.C. were  very casual and perfunctory, leading to denial of proper  opportunity of defence causing serious prejudice to him by denial  of the right to a fair trial. The marriage between them could not  materialise due to societal reasons as the appellant belonged to  the Scheduled Tribe, while the prosecutrix was a Christian.  Reliance was placed on Parkash Chand vs. State of Himachal                                     3 Pradesh, (2019) 5 SCC 628, Vijayan vs. State of Kerala,  (2008) 4 SCC 763, Kaini Rajan vs. State of Kerala, (2013) 9  SCC 113, Deepak Gulati vs. State of Haryana, (2013) 7 SCC  675 and Uday vs. State of Karnataka, (2003) 4 SCC 46.   6.   Ms. Pragya Baghel, learned counsel for the State, submitted  that the prosecutrix stood by the allegations during trial.   The  delay in lodging the FIR has been sufficiently explained by reason  of the compromise efforts which failed to materialise.    P.W. 7,  the sister of the prosecutrix had also confirmed that the latter  was sexually assaulted by the appellant at the point of a knife  and had come home crying.            The appellant had told the  prosecutrix to keep quiet in his absence, revealing that his  intentions were not bonafide. The defence of a consensual  relationship is irrelevant considering that the prosecutrix was  fourteen years of age. The appellant had held out a false promise  of marriage only to establish physical relations with the  prosecutrix.   He never had any such intentions from the very  inception, and he obtained the consent of the appellant by a false  misrepresentation, which is no consent in the eyes of the law.  The evidence of the prosecutrix is reliable.                                    4 7.   We have considered the submissions on behalf of the  parties. The prosecutrix in her deposition dithered with regard to  her age by first stating she was sixteen years on the date of  occurrence and then corrected herself to state she was thirteen.  Though she alleged that the appellant outraged her modesty at  the point of a knife while she was on way to school, no name of  the school has been disclosed either by the prosecutrix or her  parents P.W.5 and 6. If the prosecutrix was studying in a school  there is no explanation why proof of age was not furnished on  basis of documentary evidence such as school register etc.  P.W.10, in cross examination assessed the age of the prosecutrix  to be approximately twenty­five years. P.W.2, the cousin (brother)  of the prosecutrix aged about 30 years deposed that she was six  years younger to him.      There is thus wide variation in the  evidence with regard to the age of the prosecutrix. The Additional  Judicial Commissioner held the prosecutrix to be fourteen years  of age applying the rule of the thumb on basis of the age  disclosed by her in deposition on 18.08.2001 as 20 years.       In  absence of positive evidence being led by the prosecution with  regard to the age of the prosecutrix on the date of occurrence, the  possibility of her being above the age of eighteen years on the                                   5 date cannot be ruled out. The benefit of doubt therefore has to be  given to the appellant.  8.    A bare perusal of the examination of the accused under  Section 313 Cr.P.C. reveals it to be extremely casual and  perfunctory in nature. Three capsuled questions only were asked  to the appellant as follows which he denied:­       “Question1. There is a witness against you that when the      informant V. Anshumala Tigga was going to school you      were hiding near Tomra canal and after finding the      informant in isolation you forced her to strip naked on      knifepoint and raped her.       Question 2. After the rape when the informant ran to her      home crying to inform her parents about the incident and      when the parents of the informant came to you to inquire      about the incident, you told them that “if I have      committed rape then I will keep her as my wife”.       Question3. On your instruction, the informant’s parents      performed the “Lota Paani” ceremony of the informant, in      which the informant as well as your parents were      present, also in the said ceremony your parents had      gifted the informant a Saree and a blouse and the      informant’s parents had also gifted you some clothes”   9.    It stands well settled that circumstances not put to an  accused under Section 313 Cr.P.C. cannot be used against him,  and must be excluded from consideration. In a criminal trial, the  importance of the questions put to an accused are basic to the                                   6 principles of natural justice as it provides him the opportunity  not only to furnish his defence, but also to explain the  incriminating circumstances against him. A probable defence  raised by an accused is sufficient to rebut the accusation without  the requirement of proof beyond reasonable doubt. This Court,  time and again, has emphasised the importance of putting all  relevant questions to an accused under Section 313 Cr.P.C. In  Naval Kishore Singh v. State of Bihar, (2004) 7 SCC 502, it  was held to an essential part of a fair trial observing as follows :­      “5……The questioning of the accused under Section 313     CrPC was done in the most unsatisfactory manner.     Under Section 313 CrPC the accused should have been     given opportunity to explain any of the circumstances     appearing in the evidence against him. At least, the     various items of evidence, which had been produced by     the prosecution, should have been put to the accused in     the form of questions and he should have been given     opportunity to give his explanation. No such opportunity     was given to the accused in the instant case. We     deprecate the practice of putting the entire evidence     against the accused put together in a single question and     giving an opportunity to explain the same, as the accused     may not be in a position to give a rational and intelligent     explanation. The trial Judge should have kept in mind     the importance of giving an opportunity to the accused to     explain the adverse circumstances in the evidence and     the Section 313 examination shall not be carried out as     an empty formality. It is only after the entire evidence is     unfurled the accused would be in a position to articulate     his defence and to give explanation to the circumstances     appearing in evidence against him. Such an opportunity     being given to the accused is part of a fair trial and if it is                                   7    done in a slipshod manner, it may result in imperfect    appreciation of evidence…” 10. The appellant belonged to the Scheduled Tribe while the  prosecutrix belonged to the Christian community. They professed  different religious beliefs in a traditional society.   They both  resided in the same village Basjadi and were known to each  other. The nature and manner of allegations, coupled with the  letters exchanged between them, marked as Exhibits during the  trial, make it apparent that their love for each other grew and  matured over a sufficient period of time. They were both smitten  by each other and passions of youth ruled over their minds and  emotions. The physical relations that followed was not isolated  or sporadic in nature, but regular over the years.            The  prosecutrix had even gone and resided in the house of the  appellant. In our opinion, the delay of four years in lodgement of  the FIR, at an opportune time of seven days prior to the appellant  solemnising his marriage with another girl, on the pretext of a  promise to the prosecutrix raises serious doubts about the truth  and veracity of the allegations levelled by the prosecutrix. The  entire genesis of the case is in serious doubt in view of the  admission of the prosecutrix in cross examination that no  incident had occurred on 09.04.1999.                                  8 11.   The parents of the prosecutrix, P.Ws. 5 and 6 both  acknowledged awareness of the relationship between appellant  and the prosecutrix and that they were informed after the first  occurrence itself but offer no explanation why they did not report  the matter to the police immediately.    On the contrary, P.W. 5  acknowledges that the appellant insisted on marrying in the  Temple to which they were not agreeable and wanted the  marriage to be solemnised in the Church.               They further  acknowledged that the appellant and the prosecutrix were in love  with each other. Contrary to the claim of the prosecutrix, P.W. 6  stated that the prosecutrix was sexually assaulted in her own  house.  12.   The   prosecutrix   acknowledged     that   an    engagement  ceremony had also been performed. She further deposed that the  marriage between them could not be solemnised because they  belonged to different religions.   She was therefore conscious of  this obstacle all along, even while she continued to establish  physical relations with the appellant.      If the appellant had  married her, she would not have lodged the case.        She denied                                      9 having written any letters to the appellant, contrary to the  evidence placed on record by the defence. The amorous language  used by both in the letters exchanged reflect that the appellant  was serious about the relationship desiring to culminate the  same into marriage. But unfortunately for societal reasons, the  marriage could not materialise as they belonged to different  communities.  13.   The   question    for   our   consideration      is   whether   the  prosecutrix consented to the physical relationship under any  misconception of fact with regard to the promise of marriage by  the appellant or was her consent based on a fraudulent  misrepresentation      of   marriage     which   the   appellant   never  intended to keep since the very inception of the relationship. If  we reach the conclusion that he intentionally made a fraudulent  misrepresentation from the very inception and the prosecutrix  gave her consent on a misconception of fact, the offence of rape  under Section 375 IPC is clearly made out. It is not possible to  hold in the nature of evidence on record that the appellant  obtained her consent at the inception by putting her under any  fear. Under Section 90 IPC a consent given under fear of injury is  not a consent in the eyes of law. In the facts of the present case                                     10 we are not persuaded to accept the solitary statement of the  prosecutrix that at the time of the first alleged offence her  consent was obtained under fear of injury.  14.   Under   Section   90   IPC,    a   consent   given   under   a  misconception of fact is no consent in the eyes of law. But the  misconception of fact has to be in proximity of time to the  occurrence and cannot be spread over a period of four years. It  hardly needs any elaboration that the consent by the appellant  was a conscious and informed choice made by her after due  deliberation, it being spread over a long period of time coupled  with a conscious positive action not to protest. The prosecutrix in  her letters to the appellant also mentions that there would often  be quarrels at her home with her family members with regard to  the relationship, and beatings given to her.   15.   In Uday (supra), the appellant and the prosecutrix resided  in the same neighbourhood. As they belonged to different castes,  a matrimonial relationship could not fructify even while physical  relations continued between them on the understanding and  assurance of marriage. This Court observed as follows:                                     11           “21. It therefore appears that the consensus of           judicial opinion is in favour of the view that the           consent given by the prosecutrix to sexual           intercourse with a person with whom she is deeply           in love on a promise that he would marry her on a           later date, cannot be said to be given under a           misconception of fact. A false promise is not a fact           within the meaning of the Code. We are inclined to           agree with this view, but we must add that there is           no straitjacket formula for determining whether           consent given by the prosecutrix to sexual           intercourse is voluntary, or whether it is given           under a misconception of fact. In the ultimate           analysis, the tests laid down by the courts provide           at best guidance to the judicial mind while           considering a question of consent, but the court           must, in each case, consider the evidence before it           and the surrounding circumstances, before reaching           a conclusion, because each case has its own           peculiar facts which may have a bearing on the           question whether the consent was voluntary, or was           given under a misconception of fact. It must also           weigh the evidence keeping in view the fact that the           burden is on the prosecution to prove each and           every ingredient of the offence, absence of consent           being one of them.” 16.     The appellant, before the High Court, relied upon Kaini  Rajan (supra) in his defence. The facts were akin to the present  case.    The   physical   relationship   between   the   parties   was  established on the foundation of a promise to marry. This Court  set aside the conviction under Section 376 IPC also noticing K.P.  Thimmappa Gowda vs. State of Karnataka, (2011)14 SCC  475.     Unfortunately, the High Court did not even consider it                                     12 necessary to deal with the same much less distinguish it, if it was  possible.     It is indeed unfortunate that despite a judicial  precedent of a superior court having been cited, the High Court  after mere recitation of the facts and the respective arguments,  cryptically in one paragraph opined that in the nature of the  evidence, the letters, the photograph of the appellant with the  prosecutrix and the statement of the appellant under Section 313  Cr.P.C., his conviction and sentence required no interference.   17.   This court recently in Dhruvaram Murlidhar Sonar vs.  The State of Maharashtra and Others, AIR 2019 SC 327 and  in Pramod Suryabhan Pawar vs. State of Maharashtra and  another, (2019) 9 SCC 608 arising out of an application under  Section     482   Cr.P.C.   in   similar   circumstances   where   the  relationship originated in a love affair, developed over a period of  time accompanied by physical relations, consensual in nature,  but the marriage could not fructify because the parties belonged  to different castes and communities, quashed the proceedings.  18.   We have given our thoughtful consideration to the facts and  circumstances of the present case and are of the considered  opinion that the appellant did not make any false promise or                                      13 intentional    misrepresentation             of     marriage      leading        to  establishment of physical relationship between the parties. The  prosecutrix    was     herself   aware       of    the   obstacles       in   their  relationship   because      of   different        religious   beliefs.          An  engagement ceremony was also held in the solemn belief that the  societal   obstacles    would     be        overcome,     but    unfortunately  differences also arose whether the marriage was to solemnised in  the Church or in a Temple and ultimately failed. It is not possible  to hold on the evidence available that the appellant right from the  inception did not intend to marry the prosecutrix ever and had  fraudulently misrepresented only in order to establish physical  relation with her.     The prosecutrix in her letters acknowledged  that the appellant’s family was always very nice to her.  19.   The appellant has been acquitted of the charge under  Sections 420 and 504 I.P.C.             No appeal has been preferred  against the acquittal. There is no medical evidence on record to  sustain the conviction under Section 323 I.P.C.                  No offence is  made out against the appellant under Section 341 I.P.C.  considering the statement of prosecutrix that she had gone to live  with the appellant for 15 days of her own volition.                                           14 20.    We have no hesitation in concluding that the consent of the  prosecutrix was but a conscious and deliberated choice, as  distinct from an involuntary action or denial and which  opportunity was available to her, because of her deep­seated love  for the appellant leading her to willingly permit him liberties with  her body, which according to normal human behaviour are  permitted only to a person with whom one is deeply in love. The  observations in this regard in Uday (supra) are considered  relevant:        “25…It usually happens in such cases, when two young       persons are madly in love, that they promise to each       other several times that come what may, they will get       married. As stated by the prosecutrix the appellant also       made such a promise on more than one occasion. In such       circumstances the promise loses all significance,       particularly when they are overcome with emotions and       passion and find themselves in situations and       circumstances where they, in a weak moment, succumb       to the temptation of having sexual relationship. This is       what appears to have happened in this case as well, and       the prosecutrix willingly consented to having sexual       intercourse with the appellant with whom she was deeply       in love, not because he promised to marry her, but       because she also desired it. In these circumstances it       would be very difficult to impute to the appellant       knowledge that the prosecutrix had consented in       consequence of a misconception of fact arising from his       promise. In any event, it was not possible for the       appellant to know what was in the mind of the       prosecutrix when she consented, because there were       more reasons than one for her to consent.”                                   15 21.   In conclusion, we find the conviction of the appellant to be  unsustainable and set aside the same.          The appellant is  acquitted.   He is directed to be set at liberty forthwith unless  wanted in any other case. The appeal is allowed.                                              …………...................J.                                              [R.F.

This    appeal    has    been    filed       questioning    the                     judgment      of   Madurai     Bench    of    Madras     High    Court                     dated 11.05.2020 in Crl.OP(MD) No.5296 of 2020 by                     which    judgment       the     bail     application        of    the                     appellant has been dismissed.                      2. Brief facts giving rise to this appeal are: -                       2.1. The appellant is an accused in Crime                                  No.495 of 2015 under Sections 457, 380,  Signature Not Verified                                 457(2),    380(2),       411(2)       and   414(2)    of Digitally signed by MEENAKSHI KOHLI                                  Indian    Penal    Code.        The     appellant    was Date: 2020.06.19 16:20:02 IST Reason:                                     arrested on 21.02.2020 in the above case                                                              2       and lodged in Central Prison, Trichy. The      bail    application      of   the    appellant       under      Section    439    was    rejected        by    the   trial      court     on     30.04.2020.        After       being   in      judicial custody for more than 73 days,      the     appellant        filed      an        application      Crl.OP(MD)No.5296 of 2020 before the High      Court of Judicature of Madras at Madurai      Bench praying for grant of bail on account      of passage of such 73 days and non-filing      of charge sheet. One of the contentions of      the appellant before the High Court was      that charge sheet having not been filed,      the    appellant    is    entitled        for    bail   by      default    as     contemplated        under       Section      167(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.  2.2. The High Court referring to an order of      this Court dated 23.03.2020 passed in Suo      Moto W.P.(C) No.3 of 2020 took the view: -        “...The   Supreme    Court   order        eclipses      all       provisions        prescribing        period       of        limitation      until      further        orders.      Undoubtedly,       it        eclipses the time prescribed                                                                            3                      under Section 17(2) of the code                    of Criminal Procedure...”        2.3    Aggrieved by the order of the Madras High               Court     dated      11.05.2020,      this       appeal     has               been filed.  3.      We have heard Shri Sidharth Luthra, learned  senior counsel appearing for the appellant and Shri  Jayanth       Muthuraj,          learned    Additional            Advocate  General for the State.  4.    Shri Sidharth Luthra, learned senior counsel  for    the    appellant          contends   that    the       High    Court  committed          error    in    taking    the     view      that     this  Court’s order dated 23.03.2020 extended the period  for submission of charge sheet as prescribed under  Section 167(2) Cr.P.C.                  It is submitted that the  provisions of Section 167(2) Cr.P.C. are provisions  for protection of personal liberty and in event  charge       sheet    has    not    been    filed       by    the    police  within       the    stipulated       period,      the    appellant       is  entitled for default bail. The order of this Court  dated       23.03.2020      in     no   manner     can       be   read    as  extending the period for the prosecution to submit  the charge sheet. The High Court had erroneously                                                                   4   taken   the    view   that   the    order      of    this     Court  eclipses the time prescribed under Section 167(2)  of Code of Criminal Procedure.  5.   Learned    senior    counsel    further        submits    that  learned Single Judge in the impugned judgment had  also erred in taking a contrary view to an earlier  judgment delivered by another learned Single Judge  in Settu versus The State, Crl. O.P. (MD) No. 5291  of 2020 where the learned Single Judge of Madras  High Court decided on 08.05.2020 has taken the view  that the order of this Court dated 23.03.2020 in no  manner can be applied on the provisions of Section  167(2) of Code of Criminal Procedure.  6.   Learned    counsel    for   the     State      supports    the  impugned judgment and submits that due to enormous  difficulties    in    carrying     out   the     investigation,  charge sheet could not be filed in the present case  and the appellant is not entitled to take benefit  of Section 167(2) in precarious situation which has  occurred on account of pandemic of Covid-19.                                                                            5   7.   We have considered the submissions of learned  counsel for the parties and perused the record.   8.   The only issue which need to be decided in this  appeal is as to whether the appellant due to non-  submission of charge sheet within the prescribed  period by the prosecution was entitled for grant of  bail as per section 167(2) of the Code of Criminal  Procedure. Before we notice the order of this Court  dated 23.03.2020 passed in Suo Motu W.P.(C) No. 3  of 2020 which has been applied by the High Court on  the provisions of Section 167(2) Cr.P.C., we need  to   notice       object     and     purpose      of    enactment         of  Section 167 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.  9.   In the earlier Code, i.e., the Code of Criminal  Procedure,        1898,      Section     167         laid       down     the  procedure        to   be     followed        in      the        event    the  investigation         of   an      offence     was     not       completed  within     24     hours.     Section     167      in    the       Code    of  Criminal        Procedure,      1898,    was      premised         on    the  conclusion       of   investigation          within        24    hours   or                                                                6   within 15 days on the outside regardless of the  nature of the offence or the punishment.  10. The Law Commission of India in its Forty-first  Report recommended for increasing the time limit  for completion of investigation to 60 days. The new  Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 gave effect to the  recommendation of the Law Commission. Section 167  as   enacted   provided   for    time    limit   of   60    days  regardless     of   the   nature    of    offence     or    the  punishment.    In   the   year   1978,    Section     167   was  amended. Section 167(2) which is relevant for the  present case existing as of now is to the following  effect:-        “167.(2) The Magistrate to whom an accused       person is forwarded under this section       may,   whether   he   has   or   has   not       jurisdiction to try the case, from time to       time, authorise the detention of the       accused in such custody as such Magistrate       thinks fit, for a term not exceeding       fifteen days in the whole; and if he has       no jurisdiction to try the case or commit       it for trial, and considers further       detention unnecessary, he may order the       accused to be forwarded to a Magistrate       having such jurisdiction: Provided that-             (a) the Magistrate may authorise            the   detention  of the  accused                                       7   person,   otherwise   than  in  the custody of the police, beyond the period of fifteen days; if he is satisfied that adequate grounds exist   for   doing   so,   but  no Magistrate   shall   authorise  the detention of the accused person in custody under this paragraph for a total period exceeding,-     (i) ninety days, where the    investigation relates to an    offence    punishable    with    death, imprisonment for life    or imprisonment for a term    of not less than ten years;     (ii) sixty days, where the    investigation relates to any    other offence, and, on the    expiry of the said period of    ninety days, or sixty days,    as the case may be, the    accused   person   shall   be    released on bail if he is    prepared to and does furnish    bail,   and    every   person    released on bail under this    sub- section shall be deemed    to be so released under the    provisions of Chapter XXXIII    for the purposes of that    Chapter;]  (b) no Magistrate shall authorise detention in any custody under this section   unless  the   accused  is produced before him;  (c) no Magistrate of the second class, not specially empowered in this behalf by the High Court, shall authorise detention in the custody of the police”                                                                             8    11. A      three-Judge      Bench    of     this       Court     in    Uday  Mohanlal      Acharya       versus    State          of    Maharashtra,  (2001)5 SCC 453, has noticed the object of enacting  the provisions of Section 167 Cr.P.C. Section 57 of  the Code of Criminal Procedure contains the embargo  on   the    Police    Officers       to     detain        in    custody     a  person arrested beyond 24 hours. The object is that  the accused should be brought before a Magistrate  without delay within 24 hours, which provision is,  in   fact,    in     consonance      with       the       constitutional  mandate      engrafted      under     Article          22(2)      of     the  Constitution.        The    provision        of       Section      167    is  supplementary        to    Section        57.       The    power       under  Section 167 is given to detain a person in custody  while      police    goes     on     with       the       investigation.  Section      167    is,     therefore,          a    provision         which  authorises the Magistrate permitting the detention  of the accused in custody prescribing the maximum  period. In Uday Mohanlal Acharya(Supra), this court  while      dealing        with     Section          167        laid      down  following:-                                              9   “...This provision of Section 167 is in fact supplementary to Section 57, in consonance with the principle that the accused is entitled to demand that justice is not delayed. The object of requiring the accused to be produced before a Magistrate is to enable the Magistrate to see that remand is necessary and also to enable    the    accused   to    make    a representation which he may wish to make. The power under Section 167 is given to detain a person in custody while the police goes on with the investigation and before the Magistrate starts the enquiry. Section 167, therefore, is the provision which authorises the Magistrate permitting detention of an accused in custody and prescribing the maximum period for which such detention could be ordered. Having prescribed the maximum period, as stated above, what would be the consequences thereafter has been indicated in the proviso to sub-section (2) of Section 167. The proviso is unambiguous and clear and stipulates that the accused shall be released on bail if he is prepared to and does furnish the bail which has been termed by the judicial pronouncement to be “compulsive bail” and such bail would be deemed to be a bail under Chapter 33. The right of an accused to be released on bail after expiry of the maximum period of detention provided under Section 167 can be denied only when an accused does not furnish   bail,   as   is  apparent   from Explanation I to the said section. The proviso to sub-section (2) of Section 167 is a beneficial provision for curing the mischief of indefinitely prolonging the investigation and thereby affecting the liberty of a citizen...”                                                              10   12. Again,      there        has     been   very      detailed  consideration of Section 167 by a Three-Judge Bench  of this Court in Rakesh Kumar Paul versus State of  Assam, (2017)15 SCC 67.            This Court in the above  case   has   traced   the    legislative    history    of   the  provision of Section 167. This Court in the above  case emphasised that the debate on Section 167 must  also    be   looked     at    from    the   perspective     of  expeditious conclusion of investigation and from  the angle of personal liberty. This Court also held  that right for default bail is indefeasible right  which cannot be allowed to be frustrated by the  prosecution. Following was laid down in paragraphs  37, 38 and 39: -         “37. This Court had occasion to review the        entire case law on the subject in Union of        India v. Nirala Yadav, (2014) 9 SCC 457.        In that decision, reference was made to        Uday   Mohanlal   Acharya  v.   State   of        Maharashtra, (2001) 5 SCC 453 and the        conclusions arrived at in that decision.        We are concerned with Conclusion (3) which        reads as follows:           “13.(3) On the expiry of the said           period of 90 days or 60 days, as           the case may be, an indefeasible           right accrues in favour of the           accused for being released on bail           on account of default by the                                                 11      investigating    agency    in   the    completion of the investigation    within   the period prescribed and    the accused is entitled to be    released on bail, if he is prepared    to and furnishes the bail as    directed by the Magistrate.”  38. This Court also dealt with the decision rendered in Sanjay Dutt, (1994) 5 SCC 410 and noted that the principle laid down by the Constitution bench is to the effect that if the charge sheet is not filed and the right for “default bail” has ripened     into     the     status     of indefeasibility, it cannot be frustrated by the prosecution on any pretext. The accused can avail his liberty by filing an application stating that the statutory period for filing the charge sheet or challan has expired and the same has not yet   been   filed   and   therefore   the indefeasible right has accrued in his or her favour and further the accused is prepared to furnish the bail bond.  39. This Court also noted that apart from the   possibility    of    the   prosecution frustrating the indefeasible right, there are   occasions    when   even   the    court frustrates    the     indefeasible    right. Reference was made to Mohd. Iqbal Madar Sheikh v. State of Maharashtra, (1996) 1 SCC 722 wherein it was observed that some courts keep the application for “default bail” pending for some days so that in the meantime a charge-sheet is submitted. While such a practice both on the part of the prosecution as well as some courts must be very strongly and vehemently discouraged,    we    reiterate    that    no subterfuge should be resorted to, to defeat the indefeasible right of the                                                              12          accused for “default bail” during the        interregnum when the statutory period for        filing the charge-sheet or challan expires        and the submission of the charge-sheet or        challan in court.”  13. One more judgment of this Court on Section 167  Cr.P.C. be noticed, i.e., Achpal Alias Ramswaroop  and Another versus State of Rajasthan, (2019) 14  SCC    599.    After    referring     to    several    earlier  judgments of this Court including the judgment of  this   Court   in   Uday   Mohanlal    Acharya(supra)       and  Rakesh Kumar Paul(supra), this Court had laid down  that the provisions of the Code do not empower  anyone   to    extend   the   period       within   which   the  investigation must be completed. This Court held  that no Court either directly or indirectly can  extend such period. Following are the observations  of this Court in paragraph 20: -         “20. We now turn to the subsidiary issue,        namely, whether the High Court could have        extended the period. The provisions of the        Code do not empower anyone to extend the        period within which the investigation must        be completed nor does it admit of any such        eventuality. There are enactments such as        the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities        (Prevention) Act, 1985 and the Maharashtra        Control of Organised Crime Act, 1999 which        clearly contemplate extension of period                                                        13        and to that extent those enactments have      modified the provisions of the Code      including Section 167. In the absence of      any such similar provision empowering the      Court to extend the period, no court could      either directly or indirectly extend such      period. In any event of the matter all      that the High Court had recorded in its      order dated 03.07.2018 was the submission      that the investigation would be completed      within two months by a gazetted police      officer. The order does not indicate that      it was brought to the notice of the High      Court that the period for completing the      investigation was coming to an end. Mere      recording of submission of the Public      Prosecutor could not be taken to be an      order granting extension. We thus reject      the submissions in that behalf advanced by      the learned counsel for the State and the      complainant.”  14. The scheme of Code of Criminal Procedure as  noticed above clearly delineates that provisions of  Section 167 of Code of Criminal Procedure gives due  regard   to   the   personal   liberty   of   a   person.  Without submission of charge sheet within 60 days  or 90 days as may be applicable, an accused cannot  be detained by the Police. The provision gives due  recognition to the personal liberty. 15. After noticing the purpose and            object   of  Section 167, we now come to the judgment of this  Court dated 23.03.2020 which has been relied and                                                         14   referred by learned Single Judge in the impugned  judgment   for   holding   that   the   time   period   in  Section 167(2) is eclipsed by judgement of this  Court dated 23.03.2020. The Order dated 23.03.2020  was passed by this Court in Suo Motu W.P.(C) No.3  of 2020. The entire order passed on 23.03.2020 is  to the following effect: -           “This   Court    has    taken Suo   Motu      cognizance of the situation arising out of      the challenge faced by the country on      account of Covid-19 Virus and resultant      difficulties    that    may    be faced   by      litigants across the country in filing      their   petitions/    applications/   suits/      appeals/all other proceedings within the      period of limitation prescribed under the      general law of limitation or under Special      Laws (both Central and/or State).           To obviate such difficulties and to      ensure that lawyers/litigants do not have      to    come  physically    to   file   such      proceedings in respective Courts/Tribunals      across the country including this Court,      it is hereby ordered that a period of      limitation   in   all   such  proceedings,      irrespective of the limitation prescribed      under the general law or Special Laws      whether condonable or not shall stand      extended w.e.f. 15th March 2020 till      further order/s to be passed by this Court      in present proceedings.          We are exercising this power under      Article 142 read with Article 141 of the      Constitution of India and declare that                                                                15        this order is a binding order within the      meaning    of   Article    141    on all      Courts/Tribunals and authorities.           This order may be brought to the      notice of all High Courts for being      communicated    to     all   subordinate      Courts/Tribunals within their respective      jurisdiction.          Issue notice to all the Registrars      General of the High Courts, returnable in      four weeks.”  16. The reason for passing the aforesaid order for  extending     the     period      of      limitation    w.e.f.  15.03.2020    for     filing     petitions/       applications/  suits/ appeals/all other proceedings are indicated  in   the    order    itself.    Two     reasons,    which     are  decipherable from the order of this Court dated  23.03.2020 for passing the order are: -      i) The situation arising out of the challenge             faced by the country on account of Covid-19             virus and resultant difficulties that are             being faced      by the      litigants across      the             country     in      filing     their      petitions/             applications/       suits/     appeals/all       other             proceedings within the period of limitation             prescribed.                                                               16           ii) To obviate such difficulties and to ensure             that lawyers/litigants do not have to come             physically   to     file    such    proceedings    in             respective       Courts/Tribunals      across     the             country including this Court.  17. The        limitation      for      filing     petitions/  applications/ suits/ appeals/all other proceedings  was extended to obviate lawyers/litigants to come  physically to file such proceedings in respective  Courts/Tribunals. The order was passed to protect  the        litigants/lawyers           whose       petitions/  applications/ suits/ appeals/all other proceedings  would become time barred they being not able to  physically come to file such proceedings. The order  was for the benefit of the litigants who have to  take remedy in law as per the applicable statute  for a right. The law of limitation bars the remedy  but not the right. When this Court passed the above  order    for    extending     the    limitation   for   filing  petitions/ applications/ suits/ appeals/all other  proceedings, the order was for the benefit of those  who have to take remedy, whose remedy may be barred                                                                         17   by time because they were unable to come physically  to     file     such         proceedings.          The     order     dated  23.03.2020 cannot be read to mean that it ever  intended       to    extend        the   period    of     filing    charge  sheet    by     police        as    contemplated         under     Section  167(2)    of        the    Code     of   Criminal        Procedure.    The  Investigating             Officer    could   have        submitted/filed  the charge sheet before the (Incharge) Magistrate.  Therefore, even during the lockdown and as has been  done in so many cases the charge-sheet could have  been      filed/submitted                before      the      Magistrate  (Incharge) and the Investigating Officer was not  precluded from filing/submitting the charge-sheet  even     within       the     stipulated          period    before     the  Magistrate (Incharge).  18. If the interpretation by learned Single Judge  in the impugned judgment is taken to its logical  end,     due    to        difficulties       and     due    to     present  pandemic, Police may also not produce an accused  within 24 hours before the Magistrate’s Court as  contemplated by Section 57 of the Code of Criminal  Procedure, 1973. As noted above, the provision of                                                                         18   Section 57 as well as Section 167 are supplementary  to    each     other       and     are    the      provisions      which  recognises         the    Right    of    Personal        Liberty   of    a  person as enshrined in the Constitution of India.  The   order    of        this    Court   dated      23.03.2020     never  meant to curtail any provision of Code of Criminal  Procedure or any other statute which was enacted to  protect the Personal Liberty of a person. The right  of prosecution to file a charge sheet even after a  period    of   60        days/   90   days    is    not    barred.   The  prosecution can very well file a charge sheet after  60 days/90 days but without filing a charge sheet  they cannot detain an accused beyond a said period  when the accused prays to the court to set him at  liberty      due    to     non-filing        of    the    charge   sheet  within       the     period       prescribed.        The     right      of  prosecution to carry on investigation and submit a  charge sheet is not akin to right of liberty of a  person enshrined under Article 21 and reflected in  other     statutes         including      Section         167,   Cr.P.C.  Following observations of Madras High Court in the                                                                  19   impugned judgment are clearly contrary to the order  dated 23.03.2020 of this Court: -          “...The Supreme Court order eclipses all         provisions    prescribing     period     of         limitation    until     further     orders.         Undoubtedly,   it    eclipses   the    time         prescribed under Section 167(2) of the         Code of Criminal Procedure also...”  19. Learned Single Judge in paragraph 13 of the  impugned      judgment     has    also     observed    that     the  lockdown announced by the Government is akin to  proclamation of Emergency. Learned Single Judge has  also referred to Financial Emergency under Article  360 of the Constitution. Learned Single Judge also  noticed    that    presently      though    the   State   is    not  passing through Emergency duly proclaimed but the  whole nation has accepted the restrictions for the  well-being of the mankind. Let us also examine as  to whether in event of proclamation of Emergency  under    Article    352    of    the   Constitution,      whether  right    to   liberty     as    enshrined   under     Article    21  stands suspended? 20. We may recall the Constitution Bench Judgment  of this Court in Additional District Magistrate,  Jabalpur versus Shivakant Shukla, (1976) 2 SCC 521,                                                                    20   where majority of the Judges(Justice H.R. Khanna  dissenting)      had        taken    the    view        that    after  proclamation     of    Emergency      under      Article   352,   no  proceedings    can     be    initiated     for    enforcement     of  right under Article 21. Justice A.N. Ray, C.J.,  with whom three other Hon’ble Judges have concurred  in   paragraph    136       and     paragraph     137    laid    down  following:-        “136. First, In view of the Presidential       Order dated June 27, 1975 under clause (1)       of Article 359 of our Constitution no       person has locus standi to move any writ       petition under Article 226 before a High       Court for Habeas Corpus or any other writ       or order or direction to enforce any right       to personal liberty of a person detained       under the Act on the grounds that the       order of detention or the continued       detention is for any reason not under or       in compliance with the Act or is illegal       or mala fide.        137. Second, Article 21 is the sole       repository of rights to life and personal       liberty against the State. Any claim to a       writ of habeas corpus is enforcement of       Article 21 and, is, therefore, barred by       the Presidential Order.”   21. Another Three-Judge judgment of this Court in  Union of India and others versus Bhanudas Krishna  Gawde and others, (1977) 1 SCC 834, took the same                                                    21   view following the majority of this Court in ADM,  Jabalpur versus Shivakant Shukla. In paragraph 23,  following was observed: -       “23………Accordingly,    if   a   person   was      deprived of his personal liberty not under      the Defence of India Act or any rule or      order made thereunder but in contravention      thereof, his locus standi to move any      court for the enforcement of his rights,      conferred by Articles 21 and 22 of the      Constitution was not barred. More or less,      similar was the pattern and effect of the      presidential Order dated November 16,      1974. The position with respect to the      Presidential Orders dated 27, 1975 and      January   8,   1976  is,   however,   quite      different.    These    orders    are    not      circumscribed by any limitation and their      applicability is not made dependent upon      the fulfilment of any condition precedent.      They impose a total or blanket ban on the      enforcement inter alia of the fundamental      rights conferred by Articles 19,21 and 22      of the Constitution which comprise all      varieties or aspects of freedom of person      compendiously    described    as   personal      liberty. [See A.K. Gopalan v. State of      Madras, AIR 1950 SC 27; Kharak Singh v.      State of U.P., AIR 1963 SC 1295 and A.D.M.      Jabalpur v. Shivakant Shukla(supra).] Thus      there is no room for doubt that the      Presidential orders dated June 27, 1975,      and   January 8,    1976, unconditionally      suspend the enforceability of the right      conferred upon any person including a      foreigner to move any court for the      enforcement of the rights enshrined in      Articles 14, 19, 21 and 22 of the      Constitution.”                                                                   22   22. Article 359 of the Constitution was amended by  the     Forty-fourth      Constitutional        Amendment       Act,  1978.       In   sub-Article     (1)   of     Article   359,    the  expression “except Articles 20 and 21 have been  inserted”.        After   the     amendment,     Article    359(1)  reads as follows:-          “       Suspension of          359(1).       Where       a       the                    Proclamation             of       enforcement            Emergency       is       in       of the rights          operation, the President       conferred by           may   by   order    declare       Part      III          that the right to move       during                 any    court     for    the       emergencies.           enforcement of such of                              the rights conferred by                              Part      III       (except                              articles 20 and 21)      as                              may be mentioned in the                              order        and        all                              proceedings pending in                              any    court     for    the                              enforcement      of     the                              rights    so      mentioned                              shall remain suspended                              for the period during                              which the Proclamation                              is in force or for such                              shorter period as may be                              spe"

The petitioner is the Editor-in-Chief of an English television news channel,  Republic TV. He is also the Managing Director of ARG Outlier Media Asianet News  Private Limited which owns and operates a Hindi television news channel by the  name of R Bharat. The petitioner anchors news shows on both channels.   2.           On 16 April 2020, a broadcast took place on Republic TV. This was followed  by a broadcast on R Bharat on 21 April 2020. These broadcasts led to the lodging of  multiple First Information Reports1 and criminal complaints against the petitioner.  They have been lodged in the States of Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan,  Madhya Pradesh, Telangana and Jharkhand as well as in the Union Territories of  Jammu and Kashmir. In the State of Maharashtra, an FIR was lodged at Police  Station Sadar, District Nagpur City. The details of this FIR are:                     “Maharashtra                     FIR No. 238 of 2020, dated 22 April 2020, registered at Police                    Station Sadar, District Nagpur City, Maharashtra, under                    Sections 153, 153-A, 153-B,295-A, 298, 500, 504(2), 506,                    120-B and 117 of the Indian Penal Code 1860.”  1     “FIRs”                                                       2 Apart from the above FIR, as many as fourteen other FIRs and complaints have  been lodged against the petitioner, of which the details are extracted below:                “?FIR No. 245 of 2020, dated 22 April 2020, registered at              Police Station Supela, District Durg, Chhattisgarh, under              sections 153-A, 295-A and 505 (2) of the Indian Penal Code              1860.               ?

Complaint dated 22 April 2020 by Madhya Pradesh Youth              Congress.”    3.    The genesis of the FIRs and complaints originates in the broadcasts on  Republic TV on 16 April 2020 and R Bharat on 21 April 2020 in relation to an  incident which took place in Gadchinchle village of Palghar district in Maharashtra.  During the course of the incident which took place on 16 April 2020, three persons  including two sadhus were brutally killed by a mob, allegedly in the presence of the  police and forest guard personnel. The incident was widely reported in the print and  electronic media. The petition states that a video recording of the incident is  available in the public domain. In his news show titled “Poochta hai Bharat” on 21  April 2020 on R Bharat, the petitioner claims to have raised issues in relation to the  allegedly tardy investigation of the incident. The segment of the news broadcast is  available for public viewing online at:               https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2i4MMpKu9I     4.    The viewpoint which the petitioner claims to have put across during the  course of the broadcast, is described in the following extract from the Writ Petition                                               4 which has been instituted by the petitioner before this Court under Article 32 of the  Indian Constitution:                    “A review of the above debate would show that its thrust was                   to question the tardy investigation, inconsistent versions of                   the authorities and the administration and the State                   Government?s silence on the Palghar incident given that the                   unfortunate incident happened in Maharashtra which is                   presently under rule of an alliance government jointly formed                   by Shiv Sena, the Congress and the Nationalist Congress                   Party. The debate highlighted the manner in which the                   incident was being portrayed by the authorities, including the                   glaring fact that the incident occurred in the presence of                   numerous police officials which fact was initially suppressed.”    5.          The petitioner claims that following the broadcast, “a well-coordinated,  widespread, vindictive and malicious campaign” was launched against him by the  Indian National Congress2 and its activists. The campaign, he alleges, was carried  out online through news reports and tweets indicating that members of the INC had  filed multiple complaints simultaneously against the petitioner before various police  stations seeking the registration of FIRs and an investigation into offences alleged to  have been committed by him under Sections 153, 153A, 153B 295A, 298, 500, 504,  506 and 120B of the Indian Penal Code 18603. A campaign for the arrest of the  petitioner was allegedly launched on social media, using the hashtag:                                            #ArrestAntiIndiaArnab   6.          The petitioner submitted, in the course of his pleadings, that all the complaints  and FIRs have incidentally been lodged in States where the governments which  2     “INC” 3     “IPC”                                                      5 were formed owe allegiance to the INC and that he believes that the law  enforcement machinery was being set in motion with an ulterior motive. To  substantiate this, the petitioner refers to an incident which allegedly took place on 23  April 2020, while he was returning by car from his studio at Worli, Mumbai  accompanied by his spouse between 12:30 and 1:00 am. His car was confronted by  two individuals on a motor-cycle. Confronted by the security personnel of the  petitioner, the two individuals on the motor-cycle are alleged to have disclosed their  identity as members of the INC. An FIR was registered at the behest of the petitioner  at NM Joshi Marg Police Station in Mumbai in which the details of the alleged attack  on him have been set out.   7.          The petitioner denies that he has propagated views of a communal nature in  the course of the news broadcasts which gave rise to the institution of numerous  complaints. Asserting his fundamental right to the freedom of speech and  expression under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution, the petitioner has moved this  Court under Article 32 for the protection of those rights. The reliefs which have been  sought are:       (i)       Quashing all the complaints and FIRs lodged against the petitioner in                 multiple States and Union Territories;       (ii)      A writ direction that no cognisance should be taken of any complaint or                 FIR on the basis of the cause of action which forms the basis of the                 complaints and FIRs which have led to the present writ proceedings; and                                                    6         (iii)      A direction to the Union Government to provide adequate safety and                     security to the petitioner and his family as well as to his colleagues at                     Republic TV and R Bharat.   8.              While entertaining the Writ Petition on 24 April 2020, this Court heard  submissions by Senior Counsel: on behalf of the petitioner by Mr Mukul Rohatgi  and Mr Siddhartha Bhatnagar; on behalf of the State of Maharashtra by Mr Kapil  Sibal; on behalf of the State of Chhattisgarh by Mr Vivek Tankha; and on behalf of  the State of Rajasthan by Dr Abhishek Manu Singhvi. Having heard the rival  submissions, this Court noted in its interim order that the order which it intended to  pass should strike a balance between the following governing principles:   (i)             The need to ensure that the criminal process does not assume the character                  of a vexatious exercise by the institution of multifarious complaints founded on                  the same cause in multiple States;  (ii)            The need for the law to protect journalistic freedom within the ambit of Article                  19(1)(a) of the Constitution;  (iii)           The requirement that recourse be taken to the remedies available to every                  citizen in accordance with the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973;  (iv)            Ensuring that in order to enable the citizen to pursue legal remedies, a                  protection of personal liberty against coercive steps be granted for a limited                  duration in the meantime;                                                          7 (v)    The investigation of an FIR should be allowed to take place in accordance         with law without this Court deploying its jurisdiction under Article 32 to         obstruct the due process of law; and  (vi)   Assuaging the apprehension of the petitioner of a threat to his safety and the         safety of his business establishment.   9.     Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner apprised this  Court, on instructions, that the petitioner had no objection to the transfer of FIR 238  of 2020 which was lodged at Police Station Sadar, District Nagpur City to NM Joshi  Marg Police Station in Mumbai for the purpose of investigation. Mr Kapil Sibal,  learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the State of Maharashtra similarly  had no objection to this course of action. This is recorded specifically in the order  passed by this Court on 24 April 2020 in the following terms:               “9 The Court was apprised by Mr Mukul Rohatgi, learned              senior counsel, on seeking instructions, that the petitioner              would have no objection if the FIR which has been lodged at              Nagpur is transferred for the purpose of investigation to the N              M Joshi Marg Police Station, Mumbai, where the petitioner              has lodged an FIR on 23 April 2020. The FIR by the petitioner              is in relation to an incident which took place at midnight,              during the course of which, he and his spouse were              obstructed by two persons and an alleged to have been              subjected to an assault, while returning home from the studio.               10 Mr Sibal has indicated that there should be no objection to              the transfer of the FIR which has been lodged at Nagpur to              Mumbai.”                                                    8 Consequently, this Court, by its interim order:         (i)     Transferred FIR 238 of 2020 lodged at Police Station Sadar, District                Nagpur City to the NM Joshi Marg Police Station in Mumbai with a                clarification that the petitioner shall cooperate in the investigation;        (ii)    Stayed further proceedings arising out of the complaints and FIRs other                than the one which had been instituted at Police Station Sadar, District                Nagpur City and stood transferred;        (iii)   Allowed the investigation to proceed in FIR 238 of 2020 which was                transferred from Police Station Sadar, District Nagpur City to the NM Joshi                Marg Police Station in Mumbai;        (iv)    Protected the petitioner against coercive steps arising out of and in relation                to the above FIR, in relation to the telecast dated 21 April 2020;        (v)     Granted liberty to the petitioner to move an application for anticipatory bail                before the Bombay High Court under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal                Procedure 19734 and to pursue such other remedies as are available in                law. It was clarified that any such application shall be considered on its                own merits by the competent court;        (vi)    Stayed further proceedings in respect of any other FIR, or as the case may                be, criminal complaints which have been filed or which may thereafter be                filed with respect to the same incident; and     4     “CrPC”                                                  9       (vii)      Directed the Commissioner of Police5, Mumbai to consider the request of                   the petitioner for being provided with security at his residence and at the                   business establishment.   10.           Following the interim order of this Court, several interim applications were  filed in the course of the proceedings. The details of each of the IAs are necessary  to facilitate our eventual analysis of the case:   IA No 48585 of 2020: filed by the petitioner   11.           The petitioner submits that:        (i)        The Mumbai police is not conducting a fair and impartial investigation in                   relation to FIR 238 of 20206 which has been transferred from Police                   Station Sadar, District Nagpur City to NM Joshi Marg Police Station in                   Mumbai for investigation;        (ii)       The manner in which the investigation has been conducted by the Mumbai                   police leads to the “inescapable conclusion” that the authorities “harbor                   grave malice and mala fide intention” against the petitioner;        (iii)      The investigation is politically motivated and has been conducted with “a                   pre-determined and pre-meditated objective” to arm-twist, harass and                   humiliate the petitioner and his family and to diminish his right to free                   speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution;    5     “CP” 6     Renumbered as FIR 164 of 2020 at NM Joshi Marg Police Station in Mumbai.                                                       10     (iv)   Since the petitioner?s news channel is questioning the complicity of the             Maharashtra police in the Palghar incident and the police fall under the             administration and control of the State government (ruled by an alliance             government of the INC), there is a clear conflict of interest in the             investigation by the Mumbai police; and      (v)    It is necessary that the investigation is stayed to prevent any miscarriage             of justice. These apprehensions are sought to be established on the basis             of the following averments:             (a) On 25 April 2020, the petitioner was served with a notice under                 Section 41(a) of the Code of Criminal Procedure 19737 summoning                 him to the police station on 26 April 2020;             (b) On 26 April 2020, the petitioner expressed his willingness to appear                 before the Investigating Officer8 through Video Conferencing9;             (c) Rejecting the above request, the IO called upon the petitioner by a                 summons dated 26 April 2020 to be physically present at NM Joshi                 Marg Police Station in Mumbai on 27 April 2020;             (d) On 27 April 2020, the petitioner was questioned without a break for                 nearly twelve hours during which he was not allowed to keep                 possession of his mobile phone or to wear his personal fitness band;             (e) During the course of the investigation, the petitioner was informed by                 the Mumbai police that the complainant Dr Nitin Kashinath Raut, who  7   “CrPC” 8   “IO” 9   “VC”                                            11       is a Cabinet Minister in the Maharashtra government and a working        President of the INC, had filed a supplementary statement indicating        when he had been provided with a clip of the broadcast;  (f)   A substantial bulk of the questions during the investigation was in        relation to a small segment comprising fifteen seconds out of a total        broadcast of fifty-two minutes;  (g) During the course of the investigation, the petitioner was asked by the        IO whether he had defamed or maligned the President of the INC in        the course of the broadcast on 21 April 2020;  (h) FIR 164 of 2020 is not based on a complaint by the President of the        INC and hence, it is inconceivable as to how the IO could have        questioned the petitioner on an alleged act of defamation which he, in        any event, denies;  (i)   Tweets made on the social media by members of the INC during and        around the time of the investigation indicate that the Mumbai police        was relying on real time information during the course of the        interrogation by “their political masters”;  (j)   Questions posed to the petitioner during the course of the        investigation have no nexus to FIR 164 of 2020. The questions which        were posed included the following:                    “(i)   Corporate structure of the Petitioner?s                   company, ARG Outlier Media Asianet Private Limited                   (“ARG”) including its board of directors. ARG owns                   and operates Republic TV and R. Bharat.                                      12                (ii)     Process of obtaining broadcasting licenses by                the news channels of the Petitioner.                (iii)    Location of archives of Petitioner?s news                channels; whether the Hindi channel of the Petitioner,                R. Bharat is based outside or inside Maharashtra.                (iv)     Does the Petitioner?s news channel send                recordings of news reports to the Central Government                (this question was asked multiple times.)                (v)      Process of selecting panelists for debates                aired on Petitioner?s news channels. Are the panelists                paid remuneration by the Petitioner?s news channel                for this purpose.                (vi)     Does the Petitioner own the house in which he                is currently staying or pays rent.”    (k) The complainant, Dr Nitin Kashinath Raut was interviewed on 29 April      2020 by a reporter of Republic TV in regard to the contradictions      between the statement in the FIR and his subsequent supplementary      statement as to the place where he had watched the video clip. In      response to the query posed to him in the interview, the complainant      stated:                 “There is no need to be confused over this point,                whatever I have mentioned in my statement, it is true.                After watching at home, I also got a clip, which was                sent to me from my party office. When I say that I                watched it earlier, it?s the truth, and later I watched a                clip, which is mentioned in the complaint that I filed in                the police station. If you have read Article 19(1) of the                Constitution, where freedom of expression and                thought is mentioned but nowhere does it allow                crossing the limits or making extreme comments.                There are restrictions mentioned and Mr Arnab has                violated them. I have a lot of respect of Mr Arnab, he?s                a senior journalist, and he has handled the media well                till now but what happened lately. I don?t know. During                his speech, he forgot that he?s a citizen of this country                and a citizen has to abide by the Constitution. I have                always supported freedom of expression for                journalists but the question is, these comments                                    13                                 involve a clear attempt to incite a riot. Arnab was                                 questioned for along during because he?s facing a                                 charge of criminal conspiracy, involving IPC 153, IPC                                 153(a) and others. You raise the point of him being                                 questioned for 12 to 12.5 hours, I want to ask you that                                 this country?s former home minister and former                                 finance minister P Chidambaram was made to sit for                                 so many hours, why did that happen? You people                                 never raise questions on the reason behind that                                 interrogation. I have heard that clip and Arnab tried to                                 stoke communal sentiments in that speech. No one                                 gave him that right, not even the Constitution.”                 (l)   On 30 April 2020, the IO issued two notices to the Chief Financial                     Officer10 of Republic TV under Sections 91 and 160 of the CrPC                     requesting for documents. Pursuant to the notice, the CFO appeared                     before the Mumbai police with publicly available documents and                     copies of broadcast licenses. He was interrogated for about 6.5 hours                     inter alia in regard to the following aspects:                              “                                 (i)      Role of the Petitioner?s wife, Mrs Samyabrata                                  Ray Goswami in the news channels and the corporate                                  structure of company.                                 (ii)     Details of the investors in the Petitioner?s                                  company, ARG Outlier Media News Private Limited                                  and whether the Petitioner ran the news channel as a                                  proxy owner for an on behalf of someone else.                                 (iii)    Surprisingly, Mr Sundaram was also asked                                  whether there was “someone” instructing the                                  Petitioner to pose questions concerning Mrs Sonia                                  Gandhi and concerning her alleged defamation.                                 (iv)     As with the Petitioner, Mr Sundaram was also                                  asked if the Petitioner?s news channel has any                                  arrangement of sending video recording of news                                  reports to the Central Government.     10      “CFO”                                                    14                                   (v)      Details on how the Petitioner?s channel                                    selects panelists for news shows and whether any                                    remuneration is paid to them.”                   (m) It has been allegedly learned that an asymptomatic officer attached to                         the NM Joshi Marg Police Station in Mumbai where the CFO was                         being interrogated had tested positive for Covid-19 a day earlier with                         the result that all officers at the police station were now being tested.                         The CFO had been subjected to grave and unnecessary danger; and                 (n) While on the one hand, the police had been investigating FIR 164 of                         2020, the FIR lodged by the petitioner following the attack on him11 is                         not being investigated satisfactorily. Two persons alleged to have                         been involved in the attack on the petitioner were enlarged on bail on                         27 April 2020 by the Magistrate?s Court at Bhoiwada, Mumbai.   12.         On the basis of the above averments, the petitioner seeks the following reliefs  by his IA:        (i)      A stay of the investigation and all incidental steps by the Mumbai police in                 connection with FIR 238 of 2020 transferred to the NM Joshi Marg Police                 Station in Mumbai (renumbered as FIR 164 of 2020) in pursuance of the                 order of this Court dated 24 April 2020;     11      FIR 148 of 2020                                                    15        (ii)       In the alternative, for a transfer of the investigation to the Central Bureau                    of Investigation12 with a direction to the CBI to submit reports to this Court                    from time to time;         (iii)      A transfer of the investigation of FIR 148 of 2020 lodged by the petitioner                    to the CBI or to an independent investigating agency;         (iv)       Permission to the petitioner to join in the investigation by video                    conferencing; and         (v)        Providing security to the petitioner and his family at his residence and for                    the business establishment.    IA 48588 of 202013: filed by the Government of Maharashtra   13.            The IA is supported by an affidavit of Abhinash Kumar, Deputy Commissioner  of Police, Zone-3, Mumbai, who is supervising the investigation into Cr. No. 164 of  2020 at the NM Joshi Marg Police Station in Mumbai. The Mumbai police has  sought to highlight the conduct of the petitioner in obstructing the due course of  investigation. The reliefs which have been sought in the IA are as follows:                       “a. Issue appropriate directions as this Hon?ble Court may                      deem fit so as to insulate the investigation agency from any                      pressure, threat or coercion from the Petitioner and to enable                      the Investigating Agency to carry out its lawful obligations in a                      fair and transparent manner;                       b. Restrain the Petitioner from abusing the interim protection                      granted to the Petitioner vide the order dated 24th April 2020;”   12      “CBI” 13      Filed by the State of Maharashtra                                                          16 14.           The basis of the IA appears from the following averments:        (i)        On 27 April 2020, the petitioner attended the NM Joshi Marg Police Station                   in Mumbai at 9 am accompanied by an entourage of his reporters and                   camerapersons and gave several speeches which were allegedly telecast                   live;        (ii)       After the petitioner had been interrogated for 4 hours, a tweet was posted                   on Republic Bharat stating in Hindi that upon coming out of the police                   station, the petitioner had claimed that „truth will prevail?;        (iii)      Two other tweets posted on Republic Bharat in regard to the conduct of                   the investigation have sought to create an impression that:                       (a) The police is biased;                       (b) The FIR lodged by the petitioner is not being investigated; and                       (c) The petitioner has been unnecessarily questioned over several                           hours;        (iv)       On 28 April 2020, the petitioner hosted a debate on Republic Bharat in the                   course of a programme titled “Puchta hai Bharat” where he made                   allegations against the Commissioner of Police14, Mumbai of his complicity                   in a scam involving India Bulls. The petitioner threatened to reveal these                   details;        (v)        The statements against the CP are intended to hinder the course of the                   investigation and the allegations have surfaced only after the investigation                   against the petitioner commenced on 26 April 2020;  14      “CP”                                                     17       (vi)      The allegation of the petitioner that the police were not investigating his                  FIR is belied by the circumstance that an FIR was registered under                  Sections 341 and 504 read with Section 34 of the IPC;        (vii)     The two accused in the FIR filed by the petitioner were arrested and                  eventually released on bail on 27 April 2020 by the Metropolitan                  Magistrate at the 13th Court at Dadar Mumbai; and        (viii)    The Deputy Commissioner of Police15, Mumbai has submitted that Palghar                  lies beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the Mumbai police and hence the                  accusations made by the petitioner are false.

Plaintiff claimed that he and his wife has become  victim     of     domestic       violence        on    the     part     of    the  defendant.

Plaintiff in the suit prayed for decree for mandatory  injunction against the defendant to remove herself and  her belonging from the first floor of the property and  a    decree     of     permanent    injunction         in     favour    of    the  plaintiff and against the defendant thereby restraining  the defendants, her agents, employees, representatives,  etc.     from     in    any     manner       creating        interference      or  obstruction of the right of the plaintiff in the suit  property and restrain her from causing interference in  the peaceful occupation of the plaintiff in the ground  floor     of      the     property.

The defendant further pleads that  since     marriage       defendant        is    staying    in     the    shared  household of the first floor which is a matrimonial  home    of      the   defendant.        The    interim    order    passed      in  complaint case dated 16.07.2016 and 26.11.2016 has been  also referred to.    10. Plaintiff filed an application under Order XII Rule  6   CPC    on    05.01.2018       read    with    Section       151     CPC   for  passing a decree on the basis of admissions made by the  defendant in the application under Section 12 of Act,  2005.      Plaintiff pleaded that property in question is  self-acquired property of the plaintiff by agreement to  sell      dated        12.01.1983        followed    by     a     registered  conveyance        deed    dated     14.07.2003.      The    defendant         has  herself in her pleadings filed in the domestic violence                                                                  9   case admitted the plaintiff to be the owner of the suit  property,    hence,   decree   of   mandatory     injunction    in  favour of the plaintiff be granted.   11.

By the application documents were sought to be produced  by the plaintiff. The Trial Court vide its order dated  20.03.2018 directed the plaintiff to file an affidavit  and documents as sought for in the application under  Order XI Rule 13 which are in his custody with advance  copy to the opposite party. A reply was filed by the  defendant on 15.02.2018 to the application filed by the  plaintiff under Order XII Rule 6 CPC. The defendant  again reiterated that the shared household was acquired  by the plaintiff through joint-family business and the  house is not his self-acquired property.                                                          10   12. The plaintiff also filed an affidavit and documents  under Order XI Rule 13 CPC in compliance of the order  of the Trial Court dated 20.03.2018.   13. The Trial Court proceeded to decide the application  under Order XII Rule 6 CPC filed by the plaintiff. By  judgment dated 08.04.2019 Trial Court decreed the suit  in the following manner:      “26. In the light of aforesaid discussion and     the   observations,   this   Court   is   of   the     considered opinion that there are sufficient     admission to pass a decree in favour of the     plaintiff. Consequently, suit of the plaintiff     is decreed for the relief of mandatory and     permanent    injunction  as   prayed    for.   The     defendant is directed to hand over the vacant     and physical possession of the suit property to     the plaintiff within 15 days. At the time of     announcement of the order, this Court asked     plaintiff whether he wants to pursue his suit     for the relief of damages to which he agreed to     waive    off   the  said   relief.    Accordingly,     statement of the plaintiff was also recorded to     this effect. Accordingly, the relief of damages     stands withdrawn. Decree sheet be prepared for     the    relief    of  permanent    and    mandatory     injunction accordingly. There is no order as to     costs. File be consigned to record room. As     requested, copy of this judgment be given     dasti.”                                                                            11   14. Aggrieved         with    the     judgment      of   Trial   Court    the  defendant filed RFA No.381 of 2019 in the High Court of  Delhi. The Delhi High Court heard the RFA filed by the  respondent along with five other RFAs and by a common  judgment dated 18.12.2019 set aside the decree of the  Trial Court and remanded the matter to the Trial Court  for    fresh     adjudication           in     accordance        with     the  directions given in paragraph 56 of the judgment.   15. The High Court noticed the facts of the different  appeals and submissions made by the learned counsel.  The    High     Court        opined     that     the     real    point     of  determination in the appeal is not as to whether suit  premises is a shared household or not and since the  domestic       violence        proceedings          initiated     by      the  daughter-in-law are pending adjudication, determination  of    this    issue    in    suit     proceedings        would   result   in  causing serious prejudice to the claim of the applicant  in the domestic violence proceedings. The High Court  observed      that     it     had      consciously        refrained      from  determining      the     question        as    to    whether     the     suit                                                                       12   premises is shared household or not. The High Court was  of   the   view    that    the     decisions       cited     have    not  considered the effect of the pending domestic violence  application    instituted    by      daughter-in-law         upon    the  civil suit. The High Court, however, held that suit for  possession    instituted     cannot     be       said   to    be    non-  maintainable since necessary answer falls within the  term “procedure established by law”. The High Court has  further    observed   that   question       is    whether    the    suit  could be simply decreed by the Trial Court on the basis  of   the   title   without       weighing    the    effect     of    the  statutory right in favour of the appellant. The High  Court in paragraph 33 made following observation:       “33……………Thus, I find that the DV Act has      aspired to bring in a sea change in the rights      of persons affected by domestic violence by      ensuring that irrespective of the ownership of      the suit premises where the aggrieved person      resided, she would still retain the right to      reside therein as long as she was able to prove      that she had endured domestic violence while      being in a domestic relationship with the owner      of such premises.”                                                               13   16. The    High    Court   opined   that   the    Trial   Court  erroneously proceeded to pass decree under Order XII  Rule 6 CPC by not impleading the husband and failing to  appreciate   the   specific   submission   of    the   appellant  while admitting the title of the respondent that the  suit premises was the joint family property but also  losing the site of the DV Act. The directions given by  the High Court are contained in the paragraph 56 to the  following effect:      “56. In these circumstances, the impugned     judgments    cannot   be   sustained   and   are     accordingly set aside. The matters are remanded     back to the Trial Court for fresh adjudication     in   accordance   with   the  directions   given     hereinbelow:            (i)At the first instance, in all           cases   where    the   respondent’s           son/the appellant’s husband has not           been impleaded, the Trial Court           shall direct his impleadment by           invoking its suo motu powers under           Order I Rule 10 CPC.            (ii) The Trial Court will then           consider whether the appellant had           made   any  unambiguous   admission           about the respondent’s ownership           rights in respect of the suit           premises; if she has and her only           defence to being dispossessed there                                        14   from is her right of residence under the DV Act, then the Trial Court   shall,  before   passing   a decree of possession on the wife premise of ownership rights, ensure that in view of the subsisting rights of the appellant under the DV Act, she is provided with an alternate   accommodation   as   per Section 19(1)(f) of the DV Act, which will continue to be provided to her till the subsistence of her matrimonial relationship.  (iii) In cases where the appellant specifically disputes the exclusive ownership rights of the respondents over      the      suit     premises notwithstanding the title documents in their favour, the Trial Court, while granting her an opportunity to lead evidence in support of her claim, will be entitled to pass interim   orders    on  applications moved by the respondents, directing the appellant to vacate the suit premises subject to the provision of      a     suitable     alternate accommodation to her under Section 19(1)(f) of the DV Act, which direction would also be subject to the final outcome of the suit.    (iv) While determining as to whether the appellant’s husband or the      in-laws      bears    the responsibility of providing such alternate   accommodation   to the appellant, if any, the Trial Court may be guided by paragraph 46 of                                                                  15             the   decision       in     Vinay     Verma           (supra).            (v) The Trial Court shall ensure           that adequate safeguards are put in           place to ensure that the direction           for alternate accommodation is not           rendered meaningless and that a           shelter is duly secured for the           appellant, during the subsistence           of her matrimonial relationship.            (vi) This exercise of directing the           appellant   to   vacate  the   suit           premises by granting her alternate           accommodation will be completed           expeditiously and not later than 6           months from today.”   17. The plaintiff-appellant aggrieved by the judgment  of the High Court dated 18.12.2019 has come up in this  appeal.   18. We    have    heard     Shri    Prabhjit    Jauhar,    learned  counsel for the appellant. Shri Nidhesh Gupta, learned  senior counsel has appeared for the respondent. We have  also heard Ms. Geeta Luthra, learned senior counsel and  Shri   Jayant    Bhushan,   learned    senior    counsel   in   the  connected SLP (C) No.9415 of 2020 in which parties are  stated to have entered into a settlement.                                                      16    19. Shri Prabhjit Jauhar, learned counsel for appellant  contends that suit property which is exclusively owned  by the appellant is not a shared household. The son of  the appellant, Raveen has no right in the property and  the son as well as respondent-daughter-in-law were only  gratuitous licencees of the appellant. The appellant  purchased the property in the year 1983, at that time  the son of the appellant was only 14 years old. It is  submitted that the respondent can claim right to reside  only in house which is either joint family property or  the husband of the respondent has a share in it. In the  property belonging to father of the husband, she has no  right to reside. Learned counsel for the appellant has  relied on judgment of this Court in S.R. Batra and Anr.  Vs. Taruna Batra, (2007) 3 SCC 169, where two-Judge  Bench of this Court held that the wife is entitled only  to claim a right under Section 17(1) to residence in a  shared household and a shared household would only mean  the house belonging to or taken on rent by the husband,                                                                                   17   or the house which belongs to the joint family of which  the husband is a member.   20. It is submitted that the complaint under the Act,  2005 filed by the respondent was only a counter blast  to the Divorce Petition dated 28.11.2014 filed by the  husband       of    the     respondent.          It      is    submitted        that  Sections 17 and 19 of the Act, 2005 do not contemplate  a    proprietary          or   ownership         right        in    the     shared  household for the aggrieved person. Shri Jauhar further  submits that her claim for alternate accommodation can  be   made     qua     husband      and   not      qua     the      father-in-law  because       her   relationship         in      the     household        emanates  pursuant to the marriage and father-in-law cannot be  under     a    statutory        obligation          to       provide      for    the  residence       and    maintenance          of      daughter-in-law.            Shri  Jauhar    submits that          unless the            definition of         shared  household under Section 2(s) is not interpreted in a  manner confining the definition of shared household to  joint family or the property where the husband has a  share    it    will       create    chaos      in      the    society.      It   is                                                                                    18   submitted       that      extensive           interpretation          of    shared  household would lead the chaos in the society which  needs to be avoided for protecting peace and harmony in  the society. He submitted that harmonious construction  by interpretation in the suit is to be adopted so that  the    right    of    the    parties      are     balanced.     Shri        Jauhar  submits that in her application filed under Section 12  of Act, 2005, the respondent has asked for alternate  accommodation.   21. Shri Jauhar submits that the High Court committed  error in not following the binding precedence of Delhi  High    Court        itself.     Shri         Jauhar    submits        that       the  respondent      never       filed    a    counter      claim    in     the       suit  filed    by    the    appellant-owner,           nor    filed     a    suit      for  declaration of her claim of property being joint family  property. Shri Jauhar submits that the High Court has  not    adverted      to   facts     of    different       appeals          and   all  appeals       were    decided       by    a    common     judgment         without  referring      to     evidence      and       pleadings    in   each        appeal  separately. The finding of the Trial Court has not been                                                                             19   overruled by the High Court in the appellant’s case.  Shri    Jauhar    further    submits       that   husband       is    not   a  necessary party in a suit filed by the father-in-law.  Shri Jauhar submits that the Trial Court has rightly  decreed the suit under Order XII Rule 6 CPC relying on  the admission made by the respondent in her application  under Section 12 of the Act, 2005. The High Court has  not followed the binding judgment of this Court in S.  R. Batra Vs. Taruna Batra which was binding on the High  Court under Article 141 of the Constitution of India.  Shri    Jauhar    submits     that    rights      of    wife    in    other  statutes    like     Hindu    Marriage       Act,      1955    and    Hindu  Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956 are only against the  husband.   22. Shri        Nidhesh     Gupta,     learned         senior        counsel  appearing for the respondent refuting the submission of  the    learned    counsel    for     the   appellant      supports      the  judgment of the High Court. Shri Gupta submits that  Act, 2005 granted protection and security of residence  to     woman.    Shri     Gupta    referring      to    definition          of                                                                      20   domestic relationship under Section 2(f) contends that  respondent       was    in   domestic       relationship   with     the  appellant and the appellant was respondent within the  meaning    of    Section     2(q)    against   whom    allegation   of  domestic violence was made in petition under Section  12.   Shri      Gupta   referring      to    definition    of   shared  household    under Section          2(s) submits      that factum   of  residence and domestic relationship with the respondent  are the only qualification to fall within the ambit of  definition of shared household. Shri Gupta submits that  second part of the definition of the shared household  is extensive in nature which gives certain example but  cannot be said to be exhaustive looking at scheme of  the Act. He submits that when 'includes' is used after  the term “means” it is extensive and not exhaustive in  nature. The respondent being in domestic relationship  with the appellant living in the suit property since  her marriage and continues to do so till date, the  property     is shared       household where      the appellant     is  staying. It is submitted that for shared household it                                                                     21   is not necessary that aggrieved person should have any  right, title or interest. It is further submitted that  it is also not necessary that the husband of the woman  should have any right, title or interest in the house.  It is submitted that protection under Section 17 is  available in all legal proceedings including the suit  filed by the appellant.   23. Referring to Section 26 of the Act, 2005 Shri Gupta  submits   that    relief   under    Section   19    was   very    well  available in Civil Procedure Code. The plea taken by  the respondent in her pleadings in the civil suit would  constitute the counter claim which warranted exercise  of power of Trial Court under Section 26 of the Act,  2005.    Referring   to    the   judgment     of   this   Court     in  S.R.Batra Vs. Taruna Batra, Shri Gupta submits that the  said judgment is distinguishable on facts. He submits  that the said case was pre-Act, 2005 case and secondly  Taruna    Batra   admitted   that    she    had    shifted   to    her  parents’ residence at the time of institution of the  suit. It is submitted that the injunction was denied                                                                                       22   since Taruna Batra was not residing in the house which  finding was not liable to be interfered with by the  High Court under Article 226 or 227 as held by this  Court. Shri Gupta further submits that the judgment of  this Court in S.R. Batra case does not lay down correct  law.     He    submits         that    the    definition             of     “shared  household”      has      not    been   correctly         analysed          in    S.R.  Batra    case.      The     definition       of    respondent             does       not  include only husband. The relatives of the husband who  have     treated      the       aggrieved         person        with      domestic  violence      can   be    arrayed      as    respondent.            There       is   no  reason to extend definition of shared household only to  property      in    which      the    husband      has     a    share.       It      is  submitted      that      S.R.    Batra      has    not     appreciated           that  second part of the definition of shared household is  merely illustration and not exhaustive. S.R.Batra also  erred in holding that alternative accommodation under  Section 19 can only be enforced against the husband.  Shri Gupta submits that the judgment of S.R. Batra does  not     correctly        interpret       provisions            of    Act,       2005.                                                                                23   Referring       two     subsequent         judgments        of    this     Court,  namely      Hiral       P.      Harsora       and        others     Vs.     Kusum  Narottamdas Harsora and others, (2016) 10 SCC 165, and  Vaishali     Abhimanyu        Joshi     Vs.    Nanasaheb          Gopal    Joshi,  (2017) 14 SCC 373, Shri Gupta submits that the above  two judgments have taken a view contrary to law lay  down   in    S.R.       Batra      case.    Shri     Gupta        submits    that  present was not a case of granting any decree under  Order XII Rule 6, the respondent having categorically  pleaded in the written statement that the suit property  was purchased from the joint family fund. Shri Gupta  referred to various documents which were brought on the  record    before the          Trial Court         indicating that           joint  family      fund      was    utilised       for     purchasing       the     suit  property.   24. Shri        Jayant        Bhushan,      learned         senior        counsel  supporting the submission of the learned counsel for  the appellant contends that rights of daughter-in-law  are      only      to        the    extent          of     right      of     the  husband/respondent. He submits that in the definition                                                                                  24   in Section 2(s) the word ‘includes’ has to be read  “means and includes”. Referring to term household, Shri  Bhushan referred to definition as given by Census of  India   where      common   kitchen       is    a    pre-requisite          of   a  household.    25. Ms. Geeta Luthra supporting the submission of Shri  Nidhesh Gupta contends that household of father-in-law  will be shared household of daughter-in-law where she  is   living    since   marriage.         Ms.    Luthra       relies    on    the  judgment of Delhi Court in Eveneet Singh Vs. Prashant  Chaudhri, 2010 SCC online Delhi 4507, Division Bench  judgment      of   Delhi    High    Court       in    Eveneet       Singh    Vs.  Prashant      Chaudhari,     2011    SCC       online       Delhi    4651    and  Division   Bench      judgment      of    the       Delhi    High    Court       in  Preeti Satija Vs. Raj Kumari and Anr., 2014 SCC online  Delhi 188.   26. Learned counsel for the parties have also referred  to various judgments of this Court and Delhi High Court                                                                                25   which    we      will        consider       while        considering          the  submissions of the parties in detail.   27.

SHANTANAGOUDAR, J.                              Leave granted.           2.              The judgment dated 21.11.2019 passed in Crl. O.P. No.           9750 of 2019 by the High Court of Judicature at Madras is called           into question in this appeal.            3.              The brief facts leading to this appeal are as follows: Signature Not Verified  Digitally signed by ASHWANI KUMAR Date: 2020.10.26 18:32:09 IST Reason:                                                          1 3.1       The Appellant was arrested and remanded to judicial  custody on 04.08.2018 for the alleged offence punishable under  Section 8(c) read with Sections 22(c), 23(c), 25A and 29 of the  Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (‘NDPS  Act’). After completion of 180 days from the remand date, that is,  31.01.2019, the Appellant (Accused No.11) filed application for  bail under Section 167(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure,  1973 (‘CrPC’) on 01.02.2019 before the Special Court for  Exclusive Trial of Cases under the NDPS Act, Chennai (‘Trial  Court’) on the ground that the investigation was not complete  and chargesheet had not yet been filed. Accordingly, on  05.02.2019, the Trial Court granted the order of bail in Crl. M.P.  No. 131 of 2019 in R.R. No. 09/2017 pending before the said  court.  3.2       The Respondent/complainant, i.e. the Intelligence  Officer, Directorate of Revenue Intelligence filed Crl. O.P. No.  9750 of 2019 before the High Court of Judicature at Madras  praying to cancel the bail of the Appellant. The High Court, by  the   impugned    judgment,   allowed   the   said   appeal   and  consequently cancelled the order of bail granted by the Trial                                  2 Court. Being aggrieved, the Appellant has approached this Court  questioning the judgment of the High Court.   3.3        It is not in dispute that the Appellant was remanded to  judicial custody on 04.08.2018 and hence the mandatory period  of 180 days prescribed for filing of final report under Section  167(2), CrPC (excluding the date of remand) was completed on  31.01.2019. This is made amply clear by the calculation of days  as per the Gregorian calendar as stated below:          “August 2018 (from 05.08.2018 to 31.08.2018) ­ 27 days       September 2018                                   ­ 30 days       October 2018                                     ­ 31 days       November 2018                                    ­ 30 days       December 2018                                    ­ 31 days       January 2019                                     ­ 31 days                                                  ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­                                      Total             ­ 180 days                                                  ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­”  3.4        Accordingly, the Appellant filed his bail application on  01.02.2019 at 10:30 a.m. before the Trial Court. During the  course of hearing of the bail application­after completion of the  arguments of the counsel for the Appellant, to be precise­the                                    3 Respondent/complainant filed an additional complaint against  the Appellant at 4:25 p.m. on 01.02.2019 and sought for  dismissal of the bail petition on the said basis. However, the Trial  Court allowed the bail application on the ground that the Court  has no power to intervene with the indefeasible right of the  Appellant conferred on him by the legislative mandate of Section  167(2).   3.5       The said judgment of the Trial Court was set aside by  the High Court on the ground that the additional complaint was  filed on 01.02.2019 itself and since the application for bail under  Section 167(2), CrPC was not disposed of by the time the  additional complaint was filed, the Appellant could not take  advantage of the fact that he had filed his bail petition prior in  time. The High Court further reasoned that the Court of Session  conducts work from the time it sits till the time it rises and hence  the Appellant could not avail of any specific benefit for having  filed the application at 10:30 a.m. inasmuch as the additional  complaint was lodged during the course of hearing of the bail  application, before the Court rose for the day.                                      4 4.   Ms. Arunima Singh, learned counsel appearing for the  Appellant, taking us through the material on record and relying  heavily on the observations of this Court in the case of Uday  Mohanlal Acharya v. State of Maharashtra, (2001) 5 SCC  453, argued that the High Court has misconstrued the mandate  of Section 167(2), CrPC and has gravely erred in entering into the  merits of the matter; that the legislative mandate conferred by  Section 167(2), CrPC was lightly brushed aside by the High Court  though the Appellant had rightly invoked the provisions thereof  after completion of the mandatory period of 180 days, that too  prior to filing of the chargesheet/additional complaint by the  Respondent;    and   that   subsequent     filing   of   chargesheet/  additional complaint by the investigating authority cannot defeat  the indefeasible right of the Appellant.   5.   Per contra, Mr. Aman Lekhi, learned Additional Solicitor  General argued in support of the judgment of the High Court  contending that the additional complaint was lodged while the  Appellant was still in custody and prior to the disposal of the  application for bail under Section 167(2), CrPC, hence there was  no question of the Appellant­accused furnishing the bail and                                    5 consequently he was liable to continued detention in custody. He  contended that the time or date of disposal of the application of  bail filed under Section 167(2) is the deciding factor to adjudge  whether the accused is entitled to default bail or not.  6.   Before we proceed further, it is relevant to note the  provisions of Section 167(2), CrPC:        “Section 167. Procedure when investigation cannot be       completed in twenty­four hours.—       (2) The Magistrate to whom an accused person is       forwarded under this section may, whether he has or has       not jurisdiction to try the case, from time to time,       authorise the detention of the accused in such custody as       such Magistrate thinks fit, for a term not exceeding fifteen       days in the whole; and if he has no jurisdiction to try the       case or commit it for trial, and considers further       detention unnecessary, he may order the accused to be       forwarded to a Magistrate having such jurisdiction:            Provided that­       (a) the Magistrate may authorise the detention of the       accused person, otherwise than in the custody of the       police, beyond the period of fifteen days, if he is satisfied       that adequate grounds exist for doing so, but no       Magistrate shall authorise the detention of the accused       person in custody under this paragraph for a total period       exceeding,­       (i) ninety days, where the investigation relates to an       offence punishable with death, imprisonment for life or       imprisonment for a term of not less than ten years;       (ii) sixty days, where the investigation relates to any other       offence, and, on the expiry of the said period of ninety       days, or sixty days, as the case may be, the accused       person shall be released on bail if he is prepared to and       does furnish bail, and every person released on bail under       this sub­section shall be deemed to be so released under                                       6       the provisions of Chapter XXXIII for the purposes of that       Chapter;       (b) no Magistrate shall authorise detention of the accused       in custody of the police under this section unless the       accused is produced before him in person for the first       time and subsequently every time till the accused remains       in the custody of the police, but the Magistrate may       extend further detention in judicial custody on production       of the accused either in person or through the medium of       electronic video linkage;       (c) no Magistrate of the second class, not specially       empowered in this behalf by the High Court, shall       authorise detention in the custody of the police.       Explanation I.­ For the avoidance of doubts, it is hereby       declared that, notwithstanding the expiry of the period       specified in paragraph (a), the accused shall be detained       in custody so long as he does not furnish bail.       Explanation II.­ If any question arises whether an accused       person was produced before the Magistrate as required       under clause (b), the production of the accused person       may be proved by his signature on the order authorising       detention or by the order certified by the Magistrate as to       production of the accused person through the medium of       electronic video linkage, as the case may be.             Provided further that in case of a woman under       eighteen years of age, the detention shall be authorised to       be in the custody of a remand home or recognised social       institution.”        In common legal parlance, the right to bail under the  Proviso to Section 167(2) is commonly referred to as ‘default bail’  or ‘compulsive bail’ as it is granted on account of the default of  the investigating agency in not completing the investigation  within the prescribed time, irrespective of the merits of the case.                                        7 6.1        It is also relevant to note Section 36A (4) of the NDPS  Act for the purpose of this matter:        “Section 36A. Offences triable by Special Courts.—       (4) In respect of persons accused of an offence punishable       under section 19 or section 24 or section 27A or for       offences involving commercial quantity the references in       sub­section (2) of section 167 of the Code of Criminal       Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974), thereof to ""ninety days"",       where they occur, shall be construed as reference to ""one       hundred and eighty days"":              Provided that, if it is not possible to complete the       investigation within the said period of one hundred and       eighty days, the Special Court may extend the said period       up to one year on the report of the Public Prosecutor       indicating the progress of the investigation and the specific       reasons for the detention of the accused beyond the said       period of one hundred and eighty days.”                                               (emphasis supplied)    6.2        Section 36A of the NDPS Act prescribes modified  application of the CrPC as indicated therein. The effect of Sub­  Clause (4) of Section 36A, NDPS Act is to require that  investigation into certain offences under the NDPS Act be  completed within a period of 180 days instead of 90 days as  provided under Section 167(2), CrPC. Hence the benefit of  additional time limit is given for investigating a more serious  category of offences. This is augmented by a further Proviso that  the Special Court may extend time prescribed for investigation                                        8 up to one year if the Public Prosecutor submits a report  indicating the progress of investigation and giving specific  reasons for requiring the detention of accused beyond the  prescribed period of 180 days. In the matter on hand, it is  admitted that the Public Prosecutor had not filed any such report  within the 180­day period for seeking extension of time up to one  year for filing final report/additional complaint before the Trial  Court.        From the aforementioned, it is clear that in the Appellant’s  case, the final report was required to be filed within 180 days  from the first date of remand.   7.   This Court in a catena of judgments including Ravi  Prakash Singh @ Arvind Singh v. State of Bihar, (2015) 8  SCC 340, has ruled that while computing the period under  Section 167(2), the day on which accused was remanded to  judicial custody has to be excluded and the day on which  challan/charge­sheet is filed in the court has to be included.  8.   As mentioned supra, it is not disputed that in compliance of  the aforementioned statutory provisions and judgments of this  Court, the Appellant waited for 180 days from the date of remand                                    9 (excluding the remand day) and thereafter filed application for  bail under Section 167(2), CrPC at 10:30 a.m. on 01.02.2019  inasmuch as till 31.01.2019 or till 10:30 a.m. of 01.02.2019, the  complainant had not yet filed final report/additional complaint  against the Appellant. On the same day, as mentioned supra,  during the course of hearing of the bail application, the  Respondent/complainant lodged an additional complaint at 4:25  p.m., and thus sought dismissal of the bail petition.  9.   Thus the points to be decided in this case are:            (a) Whether the indefeasible right accruing to             the appellant under Section 167(2), CrPC             gets extinguished by subsequent filing of an             additional complaint by the investigating             agency;            (b) Whether the Court should take into             consideration   the   time   of    filing   of    the             application for bail, based on default of the             investigating agency or the time of disposal             of    the    application     for     bail        while            answering (a). I.   The Principles Laid Down in Uday Mohanlal Acharya                                      10 10.    Upon perusal of the relevant jurisprudence, we are unable  to agree with Mr. Lekhi’s submissions. Rather, we find that both  points (a) and (b) mentioned supra have been answered by the  majority opinion of a three­Judge Bench of this Court in the case  of Uday Mohanlal Acharya (supra) by observing thus:­         “13…It is also further clear that that indefeasible right       does not survive or remain enforceable on the challan       being filed, if already not availed of, as has been held       by the Constitution Bench in Sanjay Dutt's case       (supra). The crucial question that arises for       consideration, therefore, is what is the true meaning of       the expression 'if already not availed of'? Does it mean       that an accused files an application for bail and offers       his willingness for being released on bail or does it       mean that a bail order must be passed, the accused       must furnish the bail and get him released on bail? In       our considered opinion it would be more in consonance       with the legislative mandate to hold that an accused       must be held to have availed of his indefeasible right,       the moment he files an application for being released       on bail and offers to abide by the terms and conditions       of bail. To interpret the expression “availed of” to mean       actually being released on bail after furnishing the       necessary bail required would cause great injustice to       the accused and would defeat the very purpose of the       proviso to Section 167(2) of the Criminal Procedure       Code and further would make an illegal custody to be       legal, inasmuch as after the expiry of the stipulated       period the Magistrate had no further jurisdiction to       remand and such custody of the accused is without       any valid order of remand. That apart, when an       accused files an application for bail indicating his right       to be released as no challan had been filed within the       specified period, there is no discretion left in the       Magistrate and the only thing he is required to find out                                     11 is whether the specified period under the statute has elapsed or not, and whether a challan has been filed or not. If the expression “availed of” is interpreted to mean that the accused must factually be released on bail, then in a given case where the Magistrate illegally refuses to pass an order notwithstanding the maximum period stipulated in Section 167 had expired, and yet no challan had been filed then the accused could only move to the higher forum and while the matter remains pending in the higher forum for consideration, if the prosecution files a charge­sheet then also the so­called right accruing to the accused because of inaction on the part of the investigating agency would get frustrated. Since the legislature has given its mandate it would be the bounden duty of the court to enforce the same and it would not be in the interest of justice to negate the same by interpreting the expression “if not availed of” in a manner which is capable of being abused by the prosecution….  …There is no provision in the Criminal Procedure Code authorising detention of an accused in custody after the expiry of the period indicated in proviso to sub­ section (2) of Section 167 excepting the contingency indicated in Explanation I, namely, if the accused does not furnish the bail. It is in this sense it can be stated that if after expiry of the period, an application for being released on bail is filed, and the accused offers to furnish the bail and thereby avail of his indefeasible right and then an order of bail is passed on certain terms and conditions but the accused fails to furnish the bail, and at that point of time a challan is filed, then possibly it can be said that the right of the accused stood extinguished. But so long as the accused files an application and indicates in the application to offer bail on being released by appropriate orders of the court then the right of the accused on being released on bail cannot be frustrated on the off chance of the Magistrate not being available and the matter not being moved, or that the Magistrate erroneously refuses to pass an order and the matter is moved to the higher                              12     forum and a challan is filed in interregnum. This is the     only way how a balance can be struck between the so­     called indefeasible right of the accused on failure on     the part of the prosecution to file a challan within the     specified period and the interest of the society, at large,     in lawfully preventing an accused from being released     on bail on account of inaction on the part of the     prosecuting agency”.                                          (emphasis supplied)       While holding so, this Court considered and discussed in  depth the catena of judgments on right of the accused to default  bail including Sanjay Dutt v. State through C.B.I., (1994) 5  SCC 410; Hitendra Vishnu Thakur v. State of Maharashtra,  (1994) 4 SCC 602; State through CBI v. Mohd. Ashraft Bhat,  (1996) 1 SCC 432; Dr. Bipin Shantilal Panchal v. State of  Gujarat, (1996) 1 SCC 718; and Mohamed Iqbal Madar Sheikh  v. State of Maharashtra, (1996) 1 SCC 722. 10.1      We also find it relevant for the present purpose to  quote the following conclusions of the Court in the said  judgment: ­       “13.3. On the expiry of the said period of 90 days or      60 days, as the case may be, an indefeasible right      accrues in favour of the accused for being released on      bail on account of default by the investigating agency      in the completion of the investigation within the period      prescribed and the accused is entitled to be released      on bail, if he is prepared to and furnishes the bail as      directed by the Magistrate.                                   13 13.4. When an application for bail is filed by an accused for enforcement of his indefeasible right alleged to have been accrued in his favour on account of default on the part of the investigating agency in completion of the investigation within the specified period, the Magistrate/court must dispose of it forthwith, on being satisfied that in fact the accused has been in custody for the period of 90 days or 60 days, as specified and no charge­sheet has been filed by the investigating agency. Such prompt action on the part of the Magistrate/court will not enable the prosecution to frustrate the object of the Act and the legislative mandate of an accused being released on bail on account of the default on the part of the investigating agency in completing the investigation within the period stipulated.  13.5. If the accused is unable to furnish bail, as directed by the Magistrate, then the conjoint reading of Explanation I and proviso to sub­section 2 of Section 167, the continued custody of the accused even beyond the specified period in paragraph (a) will not be unauthorised, and therefore, if during that period the investigation is complete and charge­sheet is filed then the so­called indefeasible right of the accused would stand extinguished.  13.6. The expression 'if not already availed of' used by this Court in Sanjay Dutt's case (supra) must be understood to mean when the accused files an application and is prepared to offer bail on being directed. In other words, on expiry of the period specified in paragraph (a) of proviso to sub­section (2) of Section 167 if the accused files an application for bail and offers also to furnish the bail, on being directed, then it has to be held that the accused has availed of his indefeasible right even though the Court has not considered the said application and has not indicated the terms and conditions of bail, and the accused has not furnished the same.”                             14                                         (emphasis supplied)  10.2      In Uday Mohanlal Acharya, the application for  default bail filed by the accused was rejected by the Magistrate  based on the wrongful assumption that Section 167(2), CrPC is  not applicable to cases pertaining to the Maharashtra Protection  of Interest of Depositors (in Financial Establishments) Act, 1999.  The chargesheet was filed while the application challenging  rejection of bail was pending before the High Court. Hence the  High Court held that the right to default bail was no longer  enforceable.           Based on the abovementioned principles, the majority  opinion held that the accused is deemed to have exercised his  right to default bail under Section 167(2), CrPC the moment he  files the application for bail and offers to abide by the terms and  conditions of bail. The prosecution cannot frustrate the object of  Section 167(2), CrPC by subsequently filing a chargesheet or  additional complaint while the bail application is pending  consideration or final disposal before a Magistrate or a higher  forum. Accordingly, this Court granted relief to the appellant­  accused in that case.                                     15             However, it appears that in spite of the conclusions  stated by the majority in Uday Mohanlal Acharya (supra), there  continues to be confusion as to in what specific situations default  bail ought to be granted, particularly with respect to paragraphs  13.5 and 13.6 of the decision. Hence, for the purpose of removing  all doubts, we find it necessary to clarify the circumstances in  which this entitlement may be claimed by the accused.  II.    Section 167(2) and the Fundamental Right to Life and  Personal Liberty  11.    Before we proceed to expand upon the parameters of the  right to default bail under Section 167(2) as interpreted by  various decisions of this Court, we find it pertinent to note the  observations made by this Court in Uday Mohanlal Acharya on  the fundamental right to personal liberty of the person and the  effect of deprivation of the same as follows:­           “13…Personal liberty is one of the cherished objects of       the Indian Constitution and deprivation of the same       can only be in accordance with law and in conformity       with the provisions thereof, as stipulated under Article       21 of the Constitution. When the law provides that the       Magistrate could authorise the detention of the accused       in custody up to a maximum period as indicated in the                                    16     proviso to sub­section (2) of Section 167, any further     detention beyond the period without filing of a challan     by the investigating agency would be a subterfuge and     would not be in accordance with law and in conformity     with the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code,     and as such, could be violative of Article 21 of the     Constitution.”  11.1       Article 21 of the Constitution of India provides that “no  person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except  according to procedure established by law”. It has been settled by  a Constitution Bench of this Court in Maneka Gandhi v. Union  of India, (1978) 1 SCC 248, that such a procedure cannot be  arbitrary, unfair or unreasonable. The history of the enactment of  Section 167(2), CrPC and the safeguard of ‘default bail’ contained  in the Proviso thereto is intrinsically linked to Article 21 and is  nothing   but   a   legislative   exposition   of   the   constitutional  safeguard that no person shall be detained except in accordance  with rule of law.  11.2       Under Section 167 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,  1898 (‘1898 Code’) which was in force prior to the enactment of  the CrPC, the maximum period for which an accused could be  remanded to custody, either police or judicial, was 15 days.  However, since it was often unworkable to conclude complicated                                      17 investigations   within   15    days,   a   practice    arose   wherein  investigative officers would file ‘preliminary chargesheets’ after  the expiry of the remand period. The State would then request  the magistrate to postpone commencement of the trial and  authorize further remand of the accused under Section 344 of the  1898 Code till the time the investigation was completed and the  final chargesheet was filed. The Law Commission of India in  Report No. 14 on Reforms of the Judicial Administration (Vol.  II, 1948, pages 758­760) pointed out that in many cases the  accused were languishing for several months in custody without  any final report being filed before the Courts. It was also pointed  out that there was conflict in judicial opinion as to whether the  magistrate was bound to release the accused if the police report  was not filed within 15 days.            Hence    the    Law    Commission     in     Report   No.   14  recommended the need for an appropriate provision specifically  providing for continued remand after the expiry of 15 days, in a  manner that “while meeting the needs of a full and proper  investigation in cases of serious crime, will still safeguard the  liberty of the person of the individual.” Further, that the  legislature should prescribe a maximum time period beyond                                   18 which no accused could be detained without filing of the police  report before the magistrate. It was pointed out that in England,  even a person accused of grave offences such as treason could  not be indefinitely detained in prison till commencement of the  trial.  11.3      The suggestion made in Report No. 14 was reiterated  by the Law Commission in Report No. 41 on The Code of  Criminal Procedure, 1898 (Vol. I, 1969, pages 76­77). The Law  Commission re­emphasized the need to guard against the misuse  of Section 344 of the 1898 Code by filing ‘preliminary reports’ for  remanding the accused beyond the statutory period prescribed  under Section 167. It was pointed out that this could lead to  serious abuse wherein “the arrested person can in this manner be  kept in custody indefinitely while the investigation can go on in a  leisurely manner.” Hence the Commission recommended fixing of  a maximum time limit of 60 days for remand. The Commission  considered the reservation expressed earlier in Report No. 37 that  such an extension may result in the 60 day period becoming a  matter of routine. However, faith was expressed that proper                                     19 supervision by the superior Courts would help circumvent the  same.  11.4       The suggestions made in Report No. 41 were taken  note of and incorporated by the Central Government while  drafting the Code of Criminal Procedure Bill in 1970. Ultimately,  the 1898 Code was replaced by the present CrPC. The Statement  of   Objects   and   Reasons   of    the   CrPC   provides   that   the  Government took the following important considerations into  account while evaluating the recommendations of the Law  Commission:         “3. The recommendations of the Commission were        examined carefully by the Government, keeping in        view     among     others,     the    following   basic        considerations:—        (i) an accused person should get a fair trial in        accordance with the accepted principles of natural        justice;        (ii) every effort should be made to avoid delay in        investigation and trial which is harmful not only to        the individuals involved but also to society; and        (iii) the procedure should not be complicated and        should, to the utmost extent possible, ensure fair deal        to the poorer sections of the community.”  11.5       It was in this backdrop that Section 167(2) was  enacted within the present­day CrPC, providing for time limits on  the period of remand of the accused, proportionate to the  seriousness of the offence committed, failing which the accused                                      20 acquires the indefeasible right to bail. As is evident from the  recommendations of the Law Commission mentioned supra, the  intent of the legislature was to balance the need for sufficient  time limits to complete the investigation with the need to protect  the civil liberties of the accused. Section 167(2) provides for a  clear mandate that the investigative agency must collect the  required evidence within the prescribed time period, failing which  the accused can no longer be detained. This ensures that the  investigating officers are compelled to act swiftly and efficiently  without misusing the prospect of further remand. This also  ensures that the Court takes cognizance of the case without any  undue delay from the date of giving information of the offence, so  that society at large does not lose faith and develop cynicism  towards the criminal justice system.  11.6         Therefore, as mentioned supra, Section 167(2) is  integrally   linked   to   the   constitutional   commitment   under  Article 21 promising protection of life and personal liberty against  unlawful and arbitrary detention, and must be interpreted in a  manner which serves this purpose. In this regard we find it  useful to refer to the decision of the three­Judge Bench of this  Court in Rakesh Kumar Paul v. State of Assam, (2017) 15                                     21 SCC 67, which laid down certain seminal principles as to the  interpretation of Section 167(2), CrPC though the questions of  law involved were somewhat different from the present case. The  questions before the three­Judge Bench in Rakesh Kumar Paul  were whether, firstly, the 90 day remand extension under Section  167(2)(a)(i) would be applicable in respect of offences where the  maximum period of imprisonment was 10 years, though the  minimum period was le"

The question concerning the interpretation of section 6 of the Signature Not Verified            Hindu Succession Act, 1956 (in short, 'the Act of 1956') as amended Digitally signed by Narendra Prasad Date: 2020.08.11 14:13:54 IST Reason:            by Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005 (in short, 'the Act of                                    2   2005') has been referred to a larger Bench in view of the conflicting  verdicts rendered in two Division Bench judgments of this Court in  Prakash & Ors. v. Phulavati & Ors., (2016) 2 SCC 36 and Danamma @  Suman Surpur & Anr. v. Amar & Ors., (2018) 3 SCC 343. In other  connected matters, the question involved is similar; as such, they have  also been referred for hearing along.   2.   In the case of Lokmani & Ors. v. Mahadevamma & Ors., [S.L.P.(C)  No.6840 of 2016] the High Court held that section 6, as amended by  the Act of 2005, is deemed to be there since 17.6.1956 when the Act of  1956 came into force, the amended provisions are given retrospective  effect, when the daughters were denied right in the coparcenary  property, pending proceedings are to be decided in the light of the  amended provisions. Inequality has been removed. The High Court  held that the oral partition and unregistered partition deeds are  excluded from the definition of 'partition' used in the Explanation to  amended Section 6(5).   3.   In Balchandra v. Smt. Poonam & Ors. [SLP [C] No.35994/2015],  the question raised is about the retrospectivity of section 6 as  substituted by Amendment Act, 2005 and in case the father who was  a coparcener in the joint Hindu family, was not alive when the Act of                                     3   2005 came into force, whether daughter would become a coparcener of  joint Hindu family property.   4.   In the matter of Sistia Sarada Devi v. Uppaluri Hari Narayana &  Ors. [SLP [C] No.38542/2016], the question raised is where the final  decree has not been passed in a suit for partition, whether the re­  distribution of shares can be claimed by the daughters by amended  section 6, as substituted.   5.   In   Girijavva   v.   Kumar   Hanmantagouda     &    Ors.   [SLP   [C]  No.6403/2019], the question raised is whether section 6, as  substituted, is prospective as the father died in the year 1994 and,  thus, no benefit could be drawn by the daughters.   6.   In Smt. V.L. Jayalakshmi v. V.L. Balakrishna & Ors. [SLP [C] No.  14353/2019], the petitioner sought partition of his father's ancestral  properties, and suit was filed in 2001. The trial court granted 1/7 th  share to all the parties. The same was modified. It was held petitioner,  and daughters were entitled to only 1/35th share in the light of the  decision of this Court in Prakash v. Phulavati (supra).   7.   In Indubai v. Yadavrao [SLP [C] No.24901/2019], a similar  question has been raised. In B.K. Venkatesh v. B.K. Padmavathi [SLP                                    4   [C] Nos. 1766­67/2020], the daughters have been accorded equal  shares in Item No. 1 of Schedule A property, that has been questioned.   8.   A Division Bench of this Court in Prakash v. Phulavati (supra)  held that section 6 is not retrospective in operation, and it applies  when both coparceners and his daughter were alive on the date of  commencement of Amendment Act, 9.9.2005. This Court further  opined that the provision contained in the Explanation to section 6(5)  provides for the requirement of partition for substituted section 6 is to  be a registered one or by a decree of a court, can have no application  to a statutory notional partition on the opening of succession as  provided in the unamended Section 6. The notional statutory partition  is deemed to have taken place to ascertain the share of the deceased  coparcener which is not covered either under the proviso to section  6(1) or section 6(5), including its Explanation. The registration  requirement is inapplicable to partition of property by operation of  law, which has to be given full effect. The provisions of section 6 have  been held to be prospective.   9.   In Danamma (supra), this Court held that the amended  provisions of section 6 confer full rights upon the daughter  coparcener. Any coparcener, including a daughter, can claim a  partition in the coparcenary property. Gurunalingappa died in the                                        5   year 2001, leaving behind two daughters, two sons, and a widow.  Coparcener's father was not alive when the substituted provision of  section 6 came into force. The daughters, sons and the widow were  given 1/5th share apiece.  Arguments:  10.   Shri Tushar Mehta, learned Solicitor General of India, appearing  on behalf of Union of India, raised the following arguments:  (i) The daughters have been given the right of a coparcener, to bring  equality with sons, and the exclusion of daughter from coparcenary  was discriminatory and led to oppression and negation of fundamental  rights. The Amendment Act, 2005, is not retrospective but retroactive  in operation since it enables the daughters to exercise their  coparcenary rights on the commencement of the Amendment Act.  Even though the right of a coparcener accrued to the daughter by  birth, coparcenary is a birthright.   (ii) The conferment of coparcenary status on daughters would not  affect any partition that may have occurred before 20.12.2004 when  the Bill was tabled before Rajya Sabha as contained in the proviso to  section 6(1). Hence, the conferment of right on the daughter did not  disturb   the   rights   which   got   crystallised   by   partition   before  20.12.2004.                                    6    (iii) Unamended Section 6 provided that if a male coparcener had left  behind on death a female relative specified in Class I of the Schedule  or male relative claiming through such female relative, the daughter  was entitled to limited share in the coparcenary interest of her father  not share as a coparcener in her rights. They were unable to inherit  the ancestral property like sons/male counterparts. The Mitakshara  coparcenary law not only contributed to discrimination on the ground  of gender but was oppressive and negated the fundamental right of  equality guaranteed by the Constitution of India.   (iv) With effect from 9.9.2005, the date of enforcement of Amendment  Act, the daughters became coparceners by birth, in their own right  with the same liability in the coparcenary property as if she had been  a son.   (v) The Explanation contained under Section 6(1) concerning conferral  of rights as coparcener, daughter as coparcener, shall not affect or  invalidate any disposition or alienation including any partition or  testamentary disposition of the property which had taken place before  20.12.2004.   (vi) After substitution of the provisions of section 6, the devolution of  coparcenary by survivorship has been abrogated. Now in case of death                                    7   of coparcener, male/female, the coparcenary interest would not  devolve by survivorship but by intestate succession under the  provisions of the Hindu Succession Act or based on testamentary  succession.   (vii)   The decision in Prakash v. Phulavati to the effect that there  should be a living daughter of a living coparcener on the date of  commencement of the Act of 2005 fails to appreciate that coparcenary  rights are by birth. The death of a Hindu coparcener father or any  other coparcener is only relevant for the succession of his coparcenary  interest under section 6(3) of the Act of 2005. The death of any  coparcener does not bring to an end any coparcenary. An increase or  decrease in the coparcenary interest independently held by each  coparcener may occur by birth or death. On the coparcener's death,  the notional partition is drawn only to determine his coparcenary's  interest. It does not disturb the other incidents of the coparcenary, it  can continue without disruption with other coparceners, and even new  coparceners can be added on account of birth till the time an actual  partition takes place. Coparcenary interest becomes definite only when  a partition is effected.   (viii) The daughter of a coparcener in section 6 does not imply the  daughter of a living coparcener or father, as the death of the                                    8   coparcener/father   does   not   automatically   lead   to   the   end   of  coparcenary, which may continue with other coparceners alive. Thus,  the coparcener, from whom the daughter is inheriting by her being  coparcener, needs not to be alive as on the commencement of the  Amendment Act of 2005.   (ix) The Explanation to Section 6(5) was not provided in the original  amendment Bill moved before the Rajya Sabha on 20.12.2004, which  came to be added later.   (x) Often, coparceners enter into a family arrangement or oral  partition, and it may not be necessary to register such a partition.  Explanation to section 6(5) of the Amendment Act requires the  partition to be registered, was inserted to avoid any bogus or sham  transactions. Considering the entire scheme of the Amendment Act,  the requirement of registered partition deed is directory and not  mandatory. Any coparcener relying upon any family arrangement or  oral partition must prove the same by leading proper documentary  evidence.   11.   Shri R. Venkataramani, learned senior counsel/amicus curiae,  argued as under:                                    9   (a)   There is no conflict between the decisions in Prakash v.  Phulavati (supra) and Danamma v. Suman (supra). In both the  decisions, the provisions of section 6 have been held to be of  prospective application. The amendment is a prospective one. The  declaration by the law that the daughter of a coparcener has certain  entitlements and be subject to certain liabilities is prospective. The  daughter is treated as a coparcener under the amendment Act and not  because of the daughter's birth prior to the amendment.   (b)   Unlike the joint tenancy principle in English law, a joint Hindu  family stands on a different footing. Every son by birth became a  coparcener, and because of birth, the son became entitled to be a  coparcener in the joint Hindu family property entitled to claim  partition with or without reference to the death of the Karta of a joint  Hindu family. Like a son born into the family, an adopted son is also  entitled to succeed to the joint family property. He becomes a  coparcener with adoptive father, but his relationship with the natural  family is severed, including his status as a coparcener in the family of  birth as laid down in Nagindas Bhagwandas v. Bachoo Hurkissondas,  AIR 1915 PC 41 and Nanak Chand & Ors. v. Chander Kishore & Ors.,  AIR 1982 Del. 520.                                    10   (c)   A Hindu joint family consists of male members descended  lineally from a common male ancestor, together with their mothers,  wives or widows, and unmarried daughters bound together by the  fundamental principle of a Sapindaship of family relationship is the  essence   and   distinguishing   feature   of   the   institution   of   the  coparcenary. A joint family may consist of a single male member and  widows of deceased male members. This body is purely a creature of  law and cannot be created by an act of parties, as observed in G.  Narasimulu & Ors. v. P. Basava Sankaram & Ors., AIR 1925 Mad. 249;  and State Bank of India v. Ghamandi Ram (dead) through Gurbax Rai,  (1969) 2 SCC 33. An undivided family which is the normal condition of  Hindu society is ordinarily joint not only in the estate but in food and  worship, and, therefore, not only the concerns of the joint family but  whatever relates to their commensality and their religious duties are  regulated by the member or by the manager to whom they have  expressly or by implication delegated the task of regulation as held in  Raghunadha v. Brozo Kishore, 3 IA 154 (PC). The coparcener status  being the result of birth; possession of the joint property is only an  adjunct of the joint family and is not necessary for its constitution, as  discussed in Haridas Narayandas Bhatia v. Devkuvarbai Mulji,             AIR  1926 Bom. 408.                                         11   (d)   A   Hindu   coparcenary      is    said   to   have   seven   essential  characteristics, which include that the interest of a deceased member  survives on his death and merges in the coparcenary property as  observed in Controller of Estate Duty, Madras v. Alladi Kuppuswamy,  (1977) 3 SCC 385. As a result, if father or any other coparcener has  died before the Amendment Act, 2005, the interest of father or another  coparcener would have already merged in the surviving coparcenary.  Consequently, there will be no coparcener alive, from whom the  daughter will succeed. Thus, the daughter can succeed only in the  interest of living coparcener as on the date of enforcement of the  Amendment Act.   (e)   In Anthonyswamy v. Chhinnaswamy, (1969) 3 SCC 15, it was  observed that as a logical corollary and counter­balance to the  principle before the amendment, that the son from the moment of his  birth, acquires an interest in the coparcener, a pious obligation is  imposed on him to pay his father's debts incurred for the purpose  which is not illegal or immoral.   (f)   In Baijnath Prasad Singh & Ors. v. Tej Bali Singh, AIR 1921 PC  62, it was observed that there is a difference between coparcenary in  Hindu law, which is not identical with coparcenary as understood  under the English law. In the case of death of a member of a                                      12   coparcenary under the Mitakshara law, his right accretes to          other  members by survivorship while under the English law if one of the co­  heirs jointly inheriting property dies, his or her right goes to his or her  relations without accreting to surviving coparceners.  (g)   By birth and adoption, a male becomes a coparcener. The  custom of adoption is of ancient origin, as observed in Amarendra Man  Singh Bhramarbar & Anr. v. Sanatan Singh & Ors., AIR 1933 PC 155,  and Sri Balusu Gurulingaswami v. Sri Balusu Ramalakshmamma &  Ors., 26 IA 113. The adoption at the relevant time was only of male  and not of a female as the custom related to succession to the  property, as discussed in Bireswar Mookerji & Ors. v. Shib Chunder  Roy, 19 IA 101.   (h)   By the expression used in the amended section 6, the daughter  becomes coparcener by birth. The retrospective effect is not intended  to be given to the provisions of section 6. Though equality has been  brought in, w.e.f. 2005, the incidence of birth of a daughter before  2005 is of no consequence and not to reopen the past transactions.  (i)   The oral partition and family settlement are not intended to be  reopened by section 6(1) and 6(5).  (j)   If the daughter is treated as coparcener at any point of time in  the past before the amendment, the same will bring in enormous                                      13   uncertainty in the working of the law. It can be stated that the  Parliament has not intended to scramble the unscrambled egg or to  resurrect the past.   (k)     Challenges to partition had always come when any member of a  coparcenary, including an adopted son, stood deprived of the  entitlement to succeed to the joint family property.   (l)     The scheme of section 6 is future and forward­looking, and it  has to be interpreted in such a manner that its relevance is not  diluted. Now the rights of a coparcener have been enlarged, and the  provision has disabled it from defeating the right of a daughter from  being treated equally.   (m)     In the light of the decision in Shashikalabai (Smt) v. the State of  Maharashtra & Anr., (1998) 5 SCC 332, the past transactions cannot  be reopened. Thus, the daughter, whose coparcener father, was alive  on the date of incorporation of provisions of section 6, will be treated  as a coparcener. Any other interpretation would cause unjust  consequences.  12.     Shri V.V.S. Rao learned amicus curiae/senior counsel, argued  that:                                    14   (a)   the logic of Prakash v. Phulavati has been upheld in Mangammal  v. T.B. Raju, (2018) 15 SCC 662. It was held that there should be a  living daughter of a living coparcener to inherit the property on the  date of enforcement of the amended provisions of the 2005 Act.   (b)   Section 6(1)(a) declares a daughter to be a coparcener by birth.  By the declaration, a daughter stands included in coparcenary. As the  declaration is to the effect that the daughter is to become coparcener  by birth, the question of prospectivity or retrospectivity will not arise—  daughter, whether born before 2005 or after that, is considered a  coparcener.   (c)   Section 6(1)(b) and (c) deal with the effects of inclusion of  daughter as a coparcener. Having regard to the plain language and  future perfect tense ""shall have the same rights,"" the only conclusion  is that the daughters who are included in the coparcenary will have  the same rights after coming into force of the Amendment Act. The  future perfect tense indicates that an action will have been completed  (finished or perfected) at some point in the future. This tense is formed  with ""will"" plus ""have"" plus the past participle of the verb. If the  Parliament had intended to mean as conferring the same rights in the  coparcenary, anterior to the amendment, the language would have  been different. The future perfect tense indicates that action will have                                    15   to be completed at some point in time in the future. The tense is  formed with “will” plus ""have"" plus the past participle of the verb. If  the Parliament intended to mean conferring the same rights in the  coparcenary, anterior to the amendment, the language would have  been different. If the daughter is now made a coparcener, she would  now have the same rights as she is a son.   (d)   The legislative history of section 6 throws light in understanding  the provision before the Act of 1956 was enacted. Women were not  having any interest in the coparcenary properties, and on the demise  of a coparcener, the share of the deceased coparcener devolved on the  surviving coparceners. Hindu Succession Act made inroads into the  system. It provided that on the demise of a coparcener, his interest in  the coparcenary properties would not devolve on other coparceners by  survivorship, and the share of the deceased coparcener was to be  ascertained by way of notional partition as on the date of death. To  that limited extent, the women did not become a coparcener, but they  could inherit the property.   (e)   The 174th Report of Law Commission of India recommended the  adoption of the Kerala Model, and the amendments were effected in  Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and in several States, giving  coparcenary rights to the daughters.                                    16    (f)   The Parliament Standing Committee report indicates that the  Ministry proposed giving the benefit of the provision of this Bill to  married daughters after the commencement of the proposed amending  legislation.   (g)   It was proposed in the report that nothing in the amended  section 6 shall apply to a partition that has been effected before the  commencement of the Amendment Act.   (h)   Deliberations by the Committee also indicate that concerning the  partition effected through oral means, it was opined that it would  depend upon the facts of a particular case. As per the prevailing law, it  was not necessary that a partition should be registered. There can be  an oral partition also, as the law does not prohibit it. At the same  time, the Committee observed that the term 'partition' should be  defined appropriately, and for all practical purposes, should be  registered or should have been effected by a decree of the Court. In  case where oral partition is recognised, it should be backed by proper  evidentiary support.   (i)   The Parliament intended to confer the status of a coparcener  from the birth of a daughter. However, it was never intended to confer                                        17   her the rights in the coparcenary property retrospectively, for the  following reasons:        a.     Section 6(1)(a) deals with the inclusion of a daughter in the              coparcenary ""on and from the commencement of amendment              Act 2005, w.e.f. 9.9.2005;       b.     The operating part of section 6(1) controls not only clause (a)              but also clauses (b) and (c);       c.     Hence the daughter who is declared as coparcener from              9.9.205 would have the right in a coparcenary property only              from 9.9.2005;       d.     Equally, a daughter who is now coparcener will be subject to              the same liabilities in respect of property only from 9.9.2005.  (j)        Conferment of coparcenary status shall take effect on and from  the commencement ""of the Amendment Act."" The use of the words ""on  and from"" in section 6(1) indicates that the daughter becomes  coparcener from the commencement of the Act. The daughter of a  coparcener shall by birth become a coparcener, have the same rights  and be subject to the same liabilities. The word ""shall"" indicates the  due status of the daughter as coparcener is created only for the future  and would not affect the existing rights of a male coparcener. The use  of the words ""become,"" ""have,"" and ""be"" are all present tenses, and  they reiterate to support the above­suggested interpretation.   (k)        In the Bill recommended by the Law Commission and the Bill  introduced, the Explanation to section 6(5) was not mentioned. It was  introduced only on the recommendations of the Parliamentary  Committee. Thus, the concept of partition by registered deed and                                      18   decree of the Court were introduced. It follows that on a daughter  becoming coparcener from a particular date, she cannot prospectively  affect the share of a coparcener, which was already fixed as held in  Prakash v. Phulavati.   (l)   The essential condition for conferring the status of coparcener on  the daughter is that there should be a coparcenary on the date of  coming into force of the Act in 2005. If the coparcenary was disrupted  by the act of the parties or by the death of parties, in partition or sale,  the daughter could not get the status of a coparcener in coparcenary.  The status conferred cannot affect the past transactions of alienation,  disposition, partition – oral or written.   (m)   Partition could be in the form of a memorandum of partition, or  it could also be made orally. In most of the families, there used to be  an oral partition. Once parties settle their rights, the partition effected  orally cannot be ignored to give shares to the daughters. Such legal  transactions cannot be unsettled; the Explanation safeguards all  genuine transactions of the past, including oral partition effected by  the parties. The Explanation should not be understood as invalidating  all other documents recording partition or oral partition in respect of  coparcenary property before 20.12.2004.                                    19   (n)   Daughters conferred with the status of coparcener under the  Amendment Act cannot challenge past transactions that took place  before 20.12.2004, and the daughter should be alive as on the date of  amendment. There should be 'living coparcener' to whom the daughter  can inherit to become a coparcener.   13.   Shri Sridhar Potaraju, learned counsel, vociferously argued that:  (a)   The decision in Prakash v. Phulavati adopted the correct  interpretation of the provision. Married daughters are not considered  as part of the father's joint family. They were recognised as Class I  heirs that, by itself, did not make them part of their father's joint  Hindu family. He has relied upon Surjit Lal Chhabda v. Commissioner  of Income Tax, (1976) 3 SCC 142. A married daughter ceases to be a  member of the father's family and becomes a member of her  husband's family.   (b)   As considered by P. Ramanatha Aiyar in Major Law Lexicon, the  land is held in coparcenary when there is the unity of title, possession,  and interest. A Hindu coparcenary is a narrower body than the joint  family. A coparcener shares (equally) with others in inheritance in the  estate of a common ancestor. Otherwise called parceners are such as  have an equal portion in the inheritance of an ancestor. The share of a  coparcener is undefined and keeps fluctuating with the birth and                                     20   death of a coparcener. When a male is born, he becomes a coparcener,  thereby decreasing the share of other coparceners. In the event of the  death of a coparcener, the rule of survivorship comes into play, and  the estate devolves on the surviving coparceners to the exclusion of  heirs of the deceased coparcener. Status of a coparcener is a creation  of law commencing with birth and ending with death or by severance  of such status by way of partition or statutory fiction. The status of  coparcenary ceases on death.   (c)   ""Daughter of a coparcener"" means the daughter of an alive  person and has the status of a coparcener on the date of  commencement of the Amendment Act. In case a statutory partition  has taken place, the same is required to be recognised. It would bring  severance of jointness of status and settle the share.   (d)   If a preliminary decree of partition has been passed and has  attained finality, it must be given effect. The mere filing of a suit for  partition is sufficient to effect a partition. On separation of status, the  decree is passed by a court as held in Puttrangamma & Ors. v. M.S.  Ranganna & Ors., AIR 1968 SC 1018.                                    21   (e)   What rights have been conferred by way of survivorship are not  intended to be taken away except as provided by the amended proviso  in section 6(3) of the Amendment Act.   (f)   A legal fiction created in law cannot be stretched beyond the  purpose for which the fiction has been created, as held in Mancheri  Puthusseri Ahmed & Ors. v. Kuthiravattam Estate Receiver, (1996) 6  SCC 185.   (g)   Statutory partition leads to disruption. A statutory partition, as  provided in section 6(3), is to be given full effect. The same leads to  severance of status of jointness of the deceased coparcener and his  legal heirs, which shall include the right of maintenance from the joint  family of the widow of the deceased coparcener and such other rights.  Such partition brings an end to the joint family. In the case of death of  the father of petitioner in 1963, notional partition would occur and the  consequences laid down in Anar Devi & Ors. v. Parmeshwari Devi &  Ors., (2006) 8 SCC 656 would follow.   (h)   The married daughters on the death of father in 1963 were not  entitled to a share in the coparcenary property. Only sons were  entitled to equal shares, and sons obtained the property by way of  survivorship. The statutory partition under unamended Section 6 was                                     22   considered in Gurupad Khandappa Magdum v. Hirabai Khandappa  Magdum & Ors., (1978) 3 SCC 383. Statutory partition has been in  existence in section 6 since 1956 and is continued by the 2005  Amendment.   (i)   Section 6, as amended, is not applicable in the case of a  daughter whose father is not alive at the time of the introduction of  provisions of section 6. Every member of a joint Hindu family is not  entitled to be a coparcener either under the traditional Hindu law or  under the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 or the Amendment Act, 2005.  Under Section 29A introduced in the State of Andhra Pradesh,  unmarried daughters were given the rights of a coparcener while  excluding married daughters. The Central Amendment has not made a  distinction based on the daughter's marital status expressly but has  made it evident by the use of the expression 'joint Hindu family' and  'daughter of a coparcener.' The provisions should be read to exclude  married daughters. The provisions of section 6, as amended, are  prospective. It was not intended to unsettle the settled affairs.   (j)   The Explanation to section 6(5) cannot be interpreted to take  away the rights crystallised upon the surviving coparceners of the  joint family under the statutory partition. The purpose of the                                            23   Explanation was considered in S. Sundaram Pillai & Ors. v. V. R.  Pattabiraman & Ors., (1985) 1 SCC 591 thus:           “53. Thus, from a conspectus of the authorities referred to above, it          is manifest that the object of an Explanation to a statutory provision          is—          “(a) to explain the meaning and intendment of the Act itself,          (b) where there is any obscurity or vagueness in the main          enactment, to clarify the same to make it consistent with the          dominant object it seems to subserve,          (c) to provide an additional support to the dominant object of the          Act in order to make it meaningful and purposeful,          (d) an Explanation cannot in any way interfere with or change the          enactment or any part thereof but where some gap is left which is          relevant for the Explanation, in order to suppress the mischief and          advance the object of the Act it can help or assist the Court in          interpreting the true purport and intendment of the enactment, and          (e) it cannot, however, take away a statutory right with which any          person under a statute has been clothed or set at naught the working          of an Act by becoming an hindrance in the interpretation of the          same.”  (k)   A preliminary decree determines the shares. Section 2(2) of the  Code of Civil Procedure defines 'decree' to mean the formal expression,  which clarifies that a decree is preliminary when further proceedings  have to be taken before the suit can be decided entirely. In so far as  the determination of individual shares to be allotted to parties to the  suit is concerned, the preliminary decree is final. After the dismissal of  Special Leave Petition (C) No.38542/2016 in Sistla Sarada Devi v.  Uppaluri Hari Narayana & Ors., the only step required to be taken is to  apportion the shares by metes and bounds in terms of the preliminary  decree     which      was     passed.      The     daughters       born     after   the                                     24   commencement of the Amendment Act become coparceners, and  daughters born before the commencement of the Amendment Act have  been covered under section 6(1)(b) and granted the same rights in  coparcenary as given to a son.

Leave granted.            2.              On the fateful day of 16.08.2011, the appellant was travelling from           Chennai to Bangalore in a bus owned by the respondent State Corporation           bearing registration No. TN-01-N-7531. Signature Not Verified                                                           At about 5.40 a.m., while the bus Digitally signed by ASHA SUNDRIYAL          was moving on the Kolar Bangalore National Highway, it ran into a stationary Date: 2020.07.27 18:21:30 IST Reason:             lorry.           The collision resulted in multiple injuries to numerous passengers                                                                                              1 including the appellant, and caused death of the bus conductor on the spot.  The appellant was rushed to R.L. Jallappa Research & Medical College  Hospital, Tamak, Kolar and further treatment was administered at the  Manipal Hospital, Bangalore where she remained admitted for 8 months. The  injuries to the appellant were grievous including fractures in the arms and  legs and she suffered a disability of 31.1% of the whole body.   3.    An FIR was registered in pursuance of investigation naming the driver  of the bus as an accused. Chargesheet was filed. But what is relevant is that  the appellant filed a claim petition before the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal  (“MACT”), Madurai under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (“MV  Act”) read with Rule 3(1) of the Tamil Nadu Motor Vehicles Accident Claims  Tribunal Rules, 1989 claiming a compensation of Rupees One Crore for  injuries sustained in the accident.   Evidence was led by both the parties and  the MACT, on a perusal of the documents and oral testimonies, including the  rough sketch and the chargesheet, came to the conclusion that the accident  occurred due to the rash and negligent manner of driving of the bus driver of  the bus owned by the respondent State Corporation and, thus, held the  respondent liable to pay compensation to the appellant.          In terms of the  judgment dated 20.10.2014, the MACT opined that the permanent disability  of 31.1% would have to be considered and applied the multiplier method to  calculate the loss of earning power. Since the appellant was 23 years of age,  multiplier of 17 was applied on the monthly salary of the appellant as a  software engineer and the compensation was worked out for loss of earning                                                                                 2 power to Rs. 9,27,424/. The compensation was also attributed under various  heads of extra nourishment, medical expenses, physiotherapy, loss of  matrimonial aspects, loss of comfort and amenities, mental agony, and pain  and suffering. The total quantification of the compensation by the MACT was  of Rs. 35,24,288/- payable by the respondent State Corporation along with  interest @ 7.5% per annum from the date of petition till the date of  realization with costs.   4.    The respondent State Corporation filed an appeal against this order  and the appellant filed cross objections. Both of them were decided by the  impugned judgment of the High Court dated 27.10.2017 by a common order.  The High Court, confirming the findings of negligence of the bus driver,  reduced the compensation to Rs. 25,00,000/- primarily on the ground that  the multiplier method for quantifying loss of earning power has been wrongly  applied as it had not come on record as to how the injuries suffered by the  appellant would have a bearing on her earning capacity as a software  engineer. The interest rate was sustained.   5.    The appellant has claimed before this Court that she is entitled to  enhancement of compensation even over and above what was granted by  the MACT and has quantified the same as Rs. 41,69,831/- under various  heads along with claiming a revised interest rate @ 12% per annum.   6.    We heard learned counsels for the parties. They have also filed short  synopses of their respective claims and rebuttals thereof, with the appellant                                                                             3 enlisting the principles which can apply to her case, the law being now well  settled in like cases.   7.      There are three aspects which are required to be examined by us:  (a)     the application of multiplier of ‘17’ instead of ‘18’;   The aforesaid increase of multiplier is sought on the basis of age of the  appellant as 23 years relying on the judgment in National Insurance  Company Limited v. Pranay Sethi and Others1.              In para 42 of the said  judgment, the Constitution Bench effectively affirmed the multiplier method  to be used as mentioned in the table in the case of Sarla Verma (Smt) and  Others. v. Delhi Transport Corporation and Another. 2. In the age group of 15-  25 years, the multiplier has to be ‘18’ along with factoring in the extent of  disability.   The aforesaid position is not really disputed by learned counsel for the  respondent State Corporation and, thus, we come to the conclusion that the  multiplier to be applied in the case of the appellant has to be ‘18’ and not  ‘17’.   (b)  Loss of earning capacity of the appellant with permanent disability of 31.1%  In respect of the aforesaid, the appellant has claimed compensation on what  is stated to be the settled principle set out in Jagdish v. Mohan & Others3 and   1 (2017) 16 SCC 680 2 (2009) 6 SCC 121 3 (2018) 4 SCC 571                                                                                4 Sandeep Khanuja v. Atul Dande & Another4. We extract below the principle  set out in the Jagdish case (supra) in para 8:               “8.   In assessing the compensation payable the              settled principles need to be borne in mind. A victim              who suffers a permanent or temporary disability              occasioned by an accident is entitled to the award of              compensation. The award of compensation must cover              among others, the following aspects:                    (i)       Pain, suffering and trauma resulting                              from the accident;                    (ii)      Loss of income including future                              income;                    (iii)     The inability of the victim to lead a                              normal life together with its amenities;                    (iv)      Medical expenses including those that                              the victim may be required to undertake                              in future; and                    (v)       Loss of expectation of life.”                                                              [emphasis supplied]    The aforesaid principle has also been emphasized in an earlier judgment, i.e.  the Sandeep Khanuja case (supra) opining that the multiplier method was  logically sound and legally well established to quantify the loss of income as  a result of death or permanent disability suffered in an accident.         In the factual contours of the present case, if we examine the disability  certificate, it shows the admission/hospitalization on 8 occasions for various  number of days over 1 ½ years from August 2011 to January 2013.             The  nature of injuries had been set out as under:               “Nature of injury:                   (i)       compound fracture shaft left humerus                   (ii)      fracture both bones left forearm                   (iii)     compound fracture both bones right forearm  4 (2017) 3 SCC 351                                                                               5                   (iv)        fracture 3rd, 4th & 5th metacarpals right hand                   (v)         subtrochanteric fracture right femur                   (vi)        fracture shaft left femur                   (vii)       fracture both bones left leg”         We have also perused the photographs annexed to the petition  showing the current physical state of the appellant, though it is stated by  learned counsel for the respondent State Corporation that the same was not  on record in the trial court. Be that as it may, this is the position even after  treatment and the nature of injuries itself show their extent. Further, it has  been opined in para 12 of Sandeep Khanuja case (supra) that while applying  the multiplier method, future prospects on advancement in life and career  are also to be taken into consideration.         We are, thus, unequivocally of the view that there is merit in the  contention of the appellant and the aforesaid principles with regard to future  prospects must also be applied in the case of the appellant taking the  permanent disability as 31.1%. The quantification of the same on the basis  of the judgment in National Insurance Co. Ltd. case (supra), more specifically  para 59.3, considering the age of the appellant, would be 50% of the actual  salary in the present case.   (c)   The third and the last aspect is the interest rate claimed as 12%        In respect of the aforesaid, the appellant has watered down the  interest rate during the course of hearing to 9% in view of the judicial  pronouncements including in the Jagdish case (supra). On this aspect, once                                                                                  6 again, there was no serious dispute raised by the learned counsel for the  respondent once the claim was confined to 9% in line with the interest rates  applied by this Court.    CONCLUSION  8.    The result of the aforesaid is that relying on the settled principles, the  calculation of compensation by the appellant, as set out in para 5 of the  synopsis, would have to be adopted as follows:  HEADS                                                   AMOUNT (INR.) LOSS OF EARNING POWER (14648*12*18*31.1/100)            9,81,978.76 TOWARDS FUTURE PROSPECTS (50% ADDITION)                 4,90,989 MEDICAL    EXPENSES   INCLUDING    TRANSPORT            18,46,864 CHARGES, NOURISHMENT ETC.

The appeals are, accordingly, allowed with costs throughout.                                                                                   7 10.

The appellants here were the beneficiary of compassionate                    appointments. But on the discovery that their appointments were made Signature Not Verified  Digitally signed by                     dehors the provisions of the Karnataka Civil Services (Appointment on SUSHMA KUMARI BAJAJ Date: 2020.03.04 17:24:09 IST Reason:                       Compassionate Grounds) Rules, 1996 as amended w.e.f. 1.04.1999,                                                                             Page 1 of 16 (hereinafter referred to as the “Rules”), those appointments came to  be cancelled. The amendment to the proviso to Rule 5 stipulated that  in case of a minor dependant of the deceased government employee,  he/she must apply within one year from the date of death of the  government servant and he must have attained the age of eighteen  years on the day of making the application. Before amendment, the  minor dependant was entitled to apply till one year of attaining  majority.  3.    When their service was terminated the aggrieved appointees  approached the Karnataka Administrative Tribunal at Bangalore  (hereinafter referred to as the “Tribunal”). But the Tribunal found that  appellants were ineligible for appointment under the Rules and  accordingly dismissed the related applications.      The resultant writ  petitions were dismissed by the High Court of Karnataka at Bangalore,  leading to the present appeals.  4.    We have heard Ms. Kiran Suri, learned Senior Counsel  appearing for the appellant in the Appeal arising from the SLP (C)  No.34878 of 2013, Mr. Shanthkumar V. Mahale, learned counsel  appearing in C.A. Nos.9280-9281 of 2014 and in the appeal arising out  of the SLP (C) No.24169 of 2015. The State of Karnataka is                                                                Page 2 of 16 represented by Mr. V.N. Raghupathy and Mr S Padhi, the Learned  Counsel in the respective appeals.  5.      Assailing the adverse decision of the Tribunal as affirmed by the  High Court, the appellants contend that they have been legitimately  appointed on compassionate basis and have rendered service without  any blemish and therefore, the authority should not be permitted to  apply the amended provisions and cancel the appointment on the  ground that the appointees were ineligible to apply for compassionate  appointment.     Ms. Kiran Suri, the learned senior counsel argues that  Rule 5 is only procedural and is not mandatory and therefore,  compassionate appointment of the dependant children who attained  majority beyond one year of death of the government employee,  should not be construed to be invalid. According to the appellants,  their cases have to be considered under the unamended Rules which  permits a minor dependant to apply for compassionate appointment  within one year of attaining majority.        Describing Rule 9 as a  transitional provision whereunder the period for making application has  been changed through various amendments, the counsel for the  appellants argue that retrospective application of the amended  provisions should not lead to cancellation of appointment. Moreover,  since     compassionate     appointment    was   offered   without   any  misrepresentation by the beneficiary, the appellants should not be                                                              Page 3 of 16 rendered jobless now on the ground of non-eligibility of the  appointees.  6.     The respondents, on the other hand, argue that the norms  applicable at the stage of consideration is relevant and here as the  appellants had not attained majority within one year from the death of  the government employee, they were ineligible to seek compassionate  appointment under the amended provisions of the compassionate  Rules.      The Government counsel contend that since compassionate  appointment is an exception to the general Rule governing  appointment in the service of the State, the same has to be in  conformity with the prescribed Rules and those ineligible under the  Rules cannot ask for continuation of the illegal appointment.         The  respondents also argue that the government has the power to rectify  the mistake and to recall the illegal appointment orders as the  appellants were appointed erroneously, despite there ineligibility.  7.

Banao.      In this case, on the death of  the appellant’s mother on 24.5.1994, first, a request was made by the  appellant’s father to provide him appointment on compassionate  ground which however, was rejected by the authorities on 12.6.1997.  Thereafter, the appellant after attaining majority on 12.5.2000 made an  application for compassionate appointment on 25.9.2000 and was  appointed as a Second Division Assistant on 20.9.2001. She was  served with a show cause notice dated 2.6.2005 on the ground that  she had not attained the age of 18 years within one year from the date  of death of the government servant and accordingly, her service was  terminated vide Order dated 15.6.2005.  8.2   Challenging the order of termination, the appellant filed  application before the Tribunal.       The Tribunal vide order dated  20.10.2005 set aside the termination order holding that the service of  the appellant was terminated without holding proper enquiry under  Rule 11 of Karnataka Civil Services (Classification, Control and  Appeal) Rules, 1957 and directed her reinstatement, reserving liberty  to the State in accordance with law.                                                                 Page 6 of 16 8.3   Pursuant to the order of the Tribunal, the appellant was  reinstated in service on 04.01.2006.     Thereafter, an enquiry was  initiated against her under Rule 11 of the said Rules alleging  misconduct and misrepresentation of her age at the time of  submission of her application seeking appointment on compassionate  ground.   The appellant was then removed from the service by order  dated 28.12.2006 and when her appeal was rejected by the Appellate  Authority on 30.08.2007, she again approached the Tribunal. In her  OA No.4901/2007, the Tribunal vide its order dated 21.04.2009 found  that there was no misconduct on the part of the appellant.  Nevertheless the Tribunal affirmed the cancellation of the appointment  with the finding that the appointment was made de hors the amended  Rule 5 of the KCS (Appointment on Compassionate Grounds) Rules  and thus, the cancellation of appointment was found to be justified by  the Tribunal. The appellant’s review petition was also dismissed by  order dated 03.12.2009.      The resultant writ petition filed by the  appellant challenging cancellation of her appointment and the order of  the Tribunal were dismissed, by the High Court under the impugned  judgment dated 14.08.2013.                                                                Page 7 of 16 8.4   Though, certain additional factual details are seen in the appeal  relating to Sayeda Farheen Banao, but core issue is no different from  the other cases. The question here too is whether her appointment on  compassionate ground, was in violation of the Karnataka Civil  Services (Appointment on Compassionate Ground) Rules, 1998.  9.        The action taken by the respondents in cancellation of  appointment is under the provisions of the Karnataka Civil Services  (Appointment on Compassionate Grounds) Rules, 1996 and therefore  relevant Rules are extracted hereinbelow:-         Unamended Rule 5        “Every dependant of a deceased Government servant, seeking        appointment under these rules shall make an application within one        year from the date of death of the Government servant, in such form,        as may be notified by the Government, from time to time, to the Head        of the Department under whom the deceased Government Servant        was working.        Provided that in the case of a minor, application shall be made within        a period of one year after attaining majority.”          Following amendment w.e.f. 1.04.1999                                             the proviso to Rule 5  reads:-         “....................................................................................        Provided that in the case of a minor, he must make an application        within one year from the date of death of the Government servant        and he must have attained the age of eighteen years on the date of        making the application.                                                                                                  Page 8 of 16       Provided further that nothing in the first proviso shall apply to an       application made by the dependant of a deceased Government       Servant, after attaining majority and which was pending for       consideration on the date of commencement of the Karnataka Civil       Services (Appointment on Compassionate Grounds) (Amendment)       Rules, 1998.”          Following the 28.05.2002 amendment, Rule 9(3) reads as  under:-        “.....................................................................................       9(3) : All applications for appointment on compassionate grounds       made between the 13th day of September 1996 and the date of       commencement of the Karnataka Civil Services (Appointment on       Compassionate Grounds) 3rd Amendment Rules, 2002 by the       dependents of Government servants who died on or after 20 th       October 1989 (other than the application made by such dependents       after the first day of April, 1999 and till the date of such       commencement in contravention of the first proviso to Rule 5 which       are :            (i)       Rejected on the ground that they were not made within            the period specified in Rule 5, or            (ii)    Pending on such date of commencement, shall be            deemed to have been made within the period specified under            Rule 5 and shall be reconsidered or as the case may be            considered for appointment subject to other provisions of these            Rules.”                                                                                              Page 9 of 16 10.   While Rule 5 as it originally stood, enabled a minor dependant to  apply within one year after attaining majority, the Rule making  authority with the amendment effected from 01.04.1999 stipulated an  outer limit of one year from the date of death of the government  servant for making application for compassionate appointment. The  validity of the amended Rules is not challenged in any of the present  proceedings. Following the amendment the norms clearly suggest that  the earlier provision which enabled a minor dependant to apply on  attaining majority (may be years after the death of the government  servant), has been done away with.       The object of the amended  provision is to ensure that no application is filed beyond one year of  the death of the government employee. The consequence of  prohibiting application by a minor beyond one year from the date of  death of the parent can only mean that the appellants were  undeserving beneficiaries of compassionate appointment as they  attained majority well beyond one year of the death of their respective  parents.  11.   In all these cases, when the government employee died, the  appellants were minor and they had turned 18, well beyond one year  of death of the parent. As can be seen from the details in the chart,  the dependants attained majority after a gap of 2-6 years from the  respective date of death of their parents and then they applied for                                                           Page 10 of 16 appointment. By the time, the dependent children turned 18,          the  amended provisions became operational w.e.f. 01.04.1999. As such  their belated application for compassionate appointment should have  been rejected at the threshold as being not in conformity with proviso  to Rule 5.       The appellants applied for compassionate appointment  (after attainment of majority), well beyond the stipulated period of one  year from the date of death of the parent, and therefore, those  applications should not have been entertained being in contravention  of Rules.   12.      The provision of the Karnataka Civil Services (Appointment on  Compassionate          Grounds)   Rules,   1996   was   considered    in  Commissioner of Public Instructions and Others vs K.R. Vishwanath 1.  Speaking for the division bench, Dr. Justice Arijit Pasayat noted that  the effect of the amended second proviso is that, unless the  application is pending at the time of commencement of the  Amendment Rules, the same can have no bearing on the claim for  compassionate appointment. Thus, belated application filed by the  dependant on attaining majority beyond one year from the date of  death of the government employee would not be a valid application,  consistent with the provisions of the Rules.   1     (2005) 7 SCC 206                                                            Page 11 of 16 13.      Insofar as the appellant’s claim to legitimacy of appointment on  the basis of Rule 9(3) of the Rules, a reading of Rule 9(3) suggests  that it is a transitory provision granting extension of time for applying  for compassionate appointment. But the transitory provision excludes  application filed in contravention of Rule 5, as amended in 1999. In  other words, applications filed by minor dependants who had not  attained majority within one year from the date of death of the  government servants will be in contravention of Rule 5. Therefore, we  are of the considered view that the cases of the appellants are not  covered by the transitory provision of Rule 9(3) introduced by the  notification dated 28.5.2002.   14.      It is well settled that for all government vacancies equal  opportunity should be provided to all aspirants as is mandated under  Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution.       However appointment on  compassionate ground offered to a dependant of a deceased  employee is an exception to the said norms. In Steel Authority of India  Limited vs. Madhusudan Das & Ors. 2 It was remarked accordingly that  compassionate appointment is a concession and not a right and the  criteria laid down in the Rules must be satisfied by all aspirant.     2     (2008) 15 SCC 560                                                               Page 12 of 16 15.      This Court in SBI vs. Raj Kumar3 while reiterating that no  aspirant has a vested right to claim compassionate appointment,  declared that the norms that are in force, when the application is  actually considered, will be applicable. The employer’s right to modify  the scheme depending on its policies was recognized in this judgment.  Similarly in MCB Gramin Bank vs. Chakrawarti Singh 4 this Court  reiterated that compassionate appointment has to be considered in  accordance with the prevalent scheme and no aspirant can claim that  his case should be considered as per the scheme existing on the date  of death of the Government employee.                                                                  5 16.      However in Canara Bank & Anr. vs. M. Mahesh Kumar         in the  context of major shift in policy, whereunder, instead of compassionate  appointment (envisaged by the scheme dated 8.5.1993), ex gratia  payment was proposed (under the circular dated 14.02.2005), the  Court adopted a different approach. Noticing the extinguishment of,  the right to claim appointment, this Court held the “dying in harness  scheme” which was prevalent on the death of the employee, be the  basis for consideration.     3     (2010) 11 SCC 661 4     (2014) 13 SCC 583 5     (2015) 7 SCC 412                                                           Page 13 of 16 17.      A two judges bench headed by Justice Uday U. Lalit noticed the  Supreme Court’s view in SBI vs. Raj Kumar (supra) and MCB Gramin  Bank vs. Chakrawarti Singh (supra) on one side and the contrary view  in Canara Bank & Anr. vs. M. Mahesh Kumar (supra) and felt the  necessity of resolution of the conflicting question on whether the  norms applicable on the date of death or on the date of consideration  of application should apply. Accordingly, in State Bank of India & Ors.  vs. Sheo Shankar Tewari6 the Court referred the matter for  consideration by a larger Bench so that the conflicting views could be  reconciled.   18.      The above discussion suggest that the view taken in Canara  Bank & Anr. vs. M. Mahesh Kumar (supra) is to be reconciled with the  contrary view of the coordinate bench, in the two earlier judgments.  Therefore, notwithstanding the strong reliance placed by the  appellants counsel on Canara Bank & Anr. vs. M. Mahesh Kumar  (supra) as also the opinion of the learned Single Judge of the  Karnataka High Court in Uday Krishna Naik vs. State of Karnataka &  Ors.7,      it can not be said that the appellants claim should be  considered under the unamended provisions of the Rules prevailing on  the date of death of the Government employee.  6     (2019) 5 SCC 600 7     MANU/KA/0203/1999 (Writ Petition No.37931 of 1998)                                                            Page 14 of 16 19.      In the most recent judgment in State of Himachal Pradesh & Anr.  vs. Shashi Kumar8 the earlier decisions governing the principles of  compassionate appointment were discussed and analysed. Speaking  for the bench, Dr. Justice D.Y. Chandrachud reiterated that  appointment to any public post in the service of the State has to be  made on the basis of principles in accord with Articles 14 and 16 of the  Constitution and compassionate appointment is an exception to the  general rule. The Dependent of a deceased government employee are  made eligible by virtue of the policy on compassionate appointment  and they must fulfill the norms laid down by the State’s policy.   20.      Applying the law governing compassionate appointment culled  out from the above cited judgments, our opinion on the point at issue  is that the norms, prevailing on the date of consideration of the  application, should be the basis for consideration of claim for  compassionate appointment. A dependent of a government employee,  in the absence of any vested right accruing on the death of the  government employee, can only demand consideration of his/her  application. He is however disentitled to seek consideration in  accordance with the norms as applicable, on the day of death of the  government employee.  8     (2019) 3 SCC 653                                                              Page 15 of 16 21.   In view of the foregoing opinion, we endorse the Tribunal’s view  as affirmed by the High Court of Karnataka to the effect that the  appellants were ineligible for compassionate appointment when their  applications were considered and the unamended provisions of Rule 5  of the Rules will not apply to them. Since no infirmity is found in the  impugned judgments, the appeals are found devoid of merit and the  same are dismissed.                                                  ………………………J.

The instant batch of appeals have been filed assailing the 14:46:58 IST Reason:                            orders of various High Courts dismissing petitions filed by the                                                                                           1 appellants, thereby upholding decisions rendered by different  Benches of Central Administrative Tribunal granting financial  upgradation of grade pay in the next promotional hierarchy by  placing reliance upon Union of India and others v. Raj Pal and  another CWP No.19387 of 2011 dated 19.10.2011. In these  batch matters, we are concerned with the question whether  MACP Scheme entitles financial upgradation to the next grade  pay or to the grade pay of the next promotional hierarchy.  3.   In all these appeals, almost all the High Courts have  followed the Raj Pal and Ved Prakash’s case and granted relief  as prayed for by the respondents. Being aggrieved, the appellant-  UOI has filed these appeals.  4.  The main questions falling for consideration in these appeals are:-      (i)   Whether MACP scheme entitles financial upgradation of            pay to the next grade pay or to the grade pay of the next            promotional post as envisaged under the ACP scheme?            Whether MACP Scheme envisages grant of financial            upgradation   in   Grade   Pay   Hierarchy   and   not   in            promotional hierarchy?       (ii) As contended by the respondents, whether MACP scheme            is disadvantageous to the employees in comparison to            ACP scheme as long as the financial upgradation is            granted in hierarchy of grade pay under MACP scheme?                                                                            2       (iii) Whether respondents are entitled to stepping up of their           grade pay to be at par with grade pay of their juniors who           were getting the higher grade pay on account of           implementation of MACP Scheme?  Appeals relating to Issue No.III were ordered to be de-tagged and  listed separately.  5.    At the outset, it is to be pointed out that almost all the  Tribunals/High Courts have only relied upon Raj Pal’s case for  grant of financial upgradation on promotional hierarchy and  rejected the stand of the appellant-UOI that under MACP  scheme, the employees are entitled to financial upgradation of  the next grade pay only. Since the matter was considered on  merits and since the issue involves impact on the public ex-  chequer and also interest of the staff of various establishments,  we requested learned Senior counsel, Mr. Jaideep Gupta to  assist the Court as amicus curiae which the learned Senior  counsel has readily consented. Mr. Kunal Chatterji, learned  counsel has agreed to assist the learned Senior counsel-amicus.  Assured Career Progression (ACP) Scheme:-  6.    The Government of India with a view to “deal with the  problem of genuine stagnation and hardship faced by the  employees due to lack of adequate promotional avenues”,                                                                         3 introduced the Assured Career Progression (ACP) Scheme with  effect from 09.08.1999 vide its Office Memorandum dated  09.08.1999. To mitigate the hardship in cases of acute stagnation  in a cadre or in an isolated post, it has been decided to grant two  financial upgradations under the ACP Scheme to Group ‘B’, ‘C’  and ‘D’ employees on completion of 12 and 24 years of regular  service. As per ACP Scheme, isolated post in Group ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’  and ‘D’ cadres which have no promotional avenues also qualify  for similar benefits. The financial upgradations under the ACP  Scheme is placement in the higher Pay Scale and financial  benefits in the higher Pay Scale without regular promotion. Under  the financial upgradation, grant of financial benefits under the  ACP Scheme to the government servants concerned is on  personal basis. Such financial upgradation neither amounts to  regular promotion nor require creation of new post. Some of the  salient features of the ACP Scheme are as follows:-    ?   The ACP Scheme envisages merely placement in the higher pay-       scale/grant of financial benefits (through financial upgradation) only to       the Government servant concerned on personal basis and shall,       therefore, neither amount to functional/regular promotion nor would       require creation of new posts for the purpose;   ?   Under the ACP Scheme, two financial upgradations shall be allowed to       Group ‘B’, ‘C’ and ‘D’ employees on completion of 12 years and 24 years       of his/her regular service.                                                                               4      ?   As per para 5.1 of Annexure-1 – conditions for grant of benefits under          the ACP Scheme, it is stipulated that two financial upgradations would          be available only if no regular promotion during the prescribed period (12          and 24 years) was granted to an employee. If an employee has already          received one regular promotion, he/she would qualify for second ACP          only on completion of 24 years of regular service. However, in case if          two regular promotions have been received by an employee, no further          benefit under the ACP Scheme would accrue in favour of the employee.      ?   As per para 3.1 of the Office Memorandum dated 09.08.1999, the grant          of financial upgradations under the ACP Scheme shall be subject to the          conditions mentioned in the Annexure-I annexed thereon to the Office          Memorandum dated 09.08.1999.  7.       Para No.8 of the Annexure provides that the financial  upgradations shall be purely personal to the employee and would  have no relevance to his/her seniority position. In other words,  there would be no additional financial upgradations for the senior  employee on the ground that the junior employee has got the  higher pay scale under the ACP Scheme. Para No.12 of  Annexure-I provides that the ACP Scheme contemplates merely  placement on personal basis in the higher pay scale/grant of  financial benefits only and shall not amount to actual functional  promotion of the employees concerned. We may usefully refer to  the relevant features of the ACP Scheme as stipulated in  Annexure-I to the Office Memorandum dated 09.08.1999-                                                                                      5 Conditions for Grant of Benefits under the ACP Scheme, which  reads as under:-   Conditions for grant of benefits under the ACP Scheme:-   1.    The ACP Scheme envisages merely placement            in the higher pay-scale/grant of        financial benefits (through financial upgradation)   only to the Government servant        concerned on personal basis and shall,               therefore, neither amount to        functional/regular promotion nor would require        creation of new posts for the        purpose;        ………   4.    The first financial upgradation under the ACP Scheme shall be allowed after 12        years of regular service and the second upgradation after 12 years of regular        service from the date of the first financial upgradation subject to fulfilment of        prescribed conditions. In other words, if the first upgradation gets postponed on        account of the employee not found fit or due to departmental proceedings, etc. this        would have consequential effect on the second upgradation which would also get        deferred accordingly;        ………   8.    The financial upgradation under the ACP Scheme shall be purely personal to the        employee and shall have no relevance to his seniority position. As such, there shall        be no additional financial upgradation for the senior employee on the ground that        the junior employee in the grade has got higher pay-scale under the ACP Scheme;        ……….   12.   The proposed ACP Scheme contemplates merely placement on personal basis in        the higher pay-scale/grant of financial benefits only and shall not amount to        actual/functional promotion of the employees concerned. Since orders regarding        reservation in promotion are applicable only in the case of regular promotion,        reservation orders/roster shall not apply to the ACP Scheme which shall extend its        benefits uniformly to all eligible SC/ST employees also. However, at the time of        regular/functional (actual) promotion, the Cadre Controlling Authorities shall ensure        that all reservation orders are applied strictly;         ……...”   8.     ACP Scheme was replaced by Modified Assured Career  Progression (MACP) Scheme which became operational with  effect from 01.09.2008. The Sixth Central Pay Commission has  recommended the adoption of MACP Scheme primarily to rectify  the problems arising from inter-departmental disparities:-                                                                                                    6      (i)      ACP Scheme led to creation of certain disparities within               the employees in different organisations/departments               who were directly recruited in the same pay scale who               received different financial upgradations under the ACP               Scheme because of existence of different promotional               hierarchical structure and different promotional pay               scales in different organisations/departments;      (ii)     Another adverse consequence in the implementation of               the ACP Scheme was that the benefit of a higher pay               scale was not available if the next post in the hierarchy               also existed in the identical pay scale.  9.          In order to bring systematic changes in the existing scheme  of ACP so that all employees irrespective of existing hierarchical  structure in their organisations/cadre get the same benefit, MACP  was recommended by the Sixth Central Pay Commission which  was accepted by the Government with certain modifications vide  its Office Memorandum dated 19.05.2009.                  Under the Sixth  Central Pay Commission, revised pay structure has been  implemented with effect from 01.01.2006; whereas benefits of  ACP Scheme have been allowed till 31.08.2008. Vide Office  Memorandum dated 19.05.2009, the Government of India  introduced the MACP Scheme, in supersession of the ACP  Scheme w.e.f. 01.09.2008. There shall be no change in  distinction, classification or higher status on grant of financial                                                                           7 upgradation under MACP as the upgradation is purely personal  and merely placement in the next higher Grade Pay.  Modified Assured Career Progression (MACP) Scheme:-  10.   Under the MACP Scheme, three financial upgradations are  made available in the next grade pay to an employee who has  completed 10, 20 and 30 years of regular service in the same  post without getting any promotion. The benefit would be  available at the next higher grade pay. Some of the salient  features of the MACP Scheme are as follows:-    ? Para No.2 of the MACP Scheme provides that the “MACP       Scheme envisages merely placement in the immediate       next   higher    grade   pay    in   the   hierarchy   of   the       recommended revised pay bands and grade pay”.    ? As per para No.10 of the MACP Scheme – Office       Memorandum dated 19.05.2009, no stepping up of pay in       the pay band or grade pay would be admissible with regard       to junior getting more pay than the senior on account of pay       fixation under the MACP Scheme.    ? As per para No.11 of the said memorandum dated       19.05.2009, the differences in pay scales on account of       financial upgradations under the ACP Scheme and MACP       Scheme would not be construed as anomaly.  11.   Para   (19)     of   MACP      Scheme      contemplates     merely  placement on personal basis in the immediate higher grade                                                                           8 pay/grant of financial benefits only and shall not amount to  actual/functional promotion of the employees concerned. As per  para (20) of the MACP Scheme, financial upgradations shall be  purely personal to the employee and shall have no relevance to  the seniority position.           As such, there shall be no additional  financial upgradation for the senior employees on the ground that  the junior employees in the grade have received higher grade pay  under MACP Scheme. We may usefully extract the relevant  portion of Annexure-I of the Office Memorandum dated  19.05.2009, which reads as under:-                                        ANNEXURE-I    MODIFIED ASSURED CAREER PROGRESSION SCHEME (MACPS)    1.    There shall be three financial upgradation s under the MACPS, counted from the         direct entry grade on completion of 10, 20 and 30 years service respectively.         Financial upgradation under the Scheme will be admissible whenever a person         has spent 10 years continuously in the same grade-pay.    2.    The MACPS envisages merely placement in the immediate next higher grade         pay in the hierarchy of the recommended revised pay bands and grade pay as         given in Section 1, Part-A of the first schedule of the CCS (Revised Pay) Rules,         2008. Thus, the grade pay at the time of financial upgradation under the MACPS         can, in certain cases where regular promotion is not between two successive         grades, be different than what is available at the time of regular promotion. ln         such cases, the higher grade pay attached to the next promotion post in         the hierarchy of the concerned cadre/organisation will be given only at the         time of regular promotion.   …………    17.   The financial upgradation would be on non-functional basis subject to fitness, in         the hierarchy of grade pay within the PB-1.Thereafter for upgradation under the         MACPS the benchmark of 'good' would be applicable till the grade pay of Rs.         6600/- in PB-3. The benchmark will be 'Very Good' for financial upgradation to         the grade pay of Rs. 7600 and above.   19.   The MACPS contemplates merely placement on personal basis in the         immediate higher Grade pay /grant of financial benefits only and shall not         amount to actual functional promotion of the employees concerned.         Therefore, no reservation orders/roster shall apply to the MACPS, which shall         extend its benefits uniformly to all eligible SC/ST employees also. However, the                                                                                              9                      rules of reservation in promotion shall be ensured at the time of regular                      promotion. For this reason, it shall not be mandatory to associate members of                      SC/ST in the Screening Committee meant to consider cases for grant of financial                      upgradation under the Scheme.                      ………….                25.    lf a regular promotion has been offered but was refused by the employee before                      becoming entitled to a financial upgradation, no financial upgradation shall be                      allowed as such an employee has not been stagnated due to lack of                      opportunities. If, however, financial upgradation has been allowed due to                      stagnation and the employees subsequently refuse the promotion, it shall not be                      a ground to withdraw the financial upgradation. He shall, however, not be eligible                      to be considered for further financial upgradation till he agrees to be considered                      for promotion again and the second the next financial upgradation shall also be                      deferred to the extent of period of debarment due to the refusal.               ……………”            12.       Clause 28 contains illustrations as to grant of financial            upgradation under MACP. The illustrations in Clause 28 of the            Scheme can easily be understood by referring to the First            Schedule, Part-A of Section 1 of Central Civil Services (Revised            Pay) Rules, 2008 which gives a comparison of the scale of pay            under the 5th Pay Commission and the 6th Pay Commission as            under:-                                                  THE FIRST SCHEDULE                                                    (SEE RULES 3 & 4)                                                          PART – A                                                        SECTION I             Revised Pay Bands and Grade Pays for posts carrying present scales in Group ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’ & ‘D’ except           posts for which different revised scales are notified separately.

For grant of financial upgradation under ACP Scheme, a         Screening Committee shall be constituted for the purpose of         processing the cases for grant of benefits under the ACP         Scheme.            In terms of Clause 6.2 of the ACP Scheme, the         composition of the Screening Committee shall be the same as         that of Departmental                  Promotion Committee (DPC) prescribed                                                                                                   11 under the relevant recruitment/service rules for regular promotion  to the higher grade to which financial upgradation is to be  granted. The requirement that the composition of the Screening  Committee shall be the same as that of DPC, under ACP  Scheme, the consideration for financial upgradations are stringent  and the government servant has to satisfy the norms for  promotion.   Fulfilment   of   normal   promotional   norms   like  benchmark, departmental examination, seniority-cum-fitness (in  case of Group ‘D’ employees) are the requirement for grant of  financial upgradation under ACP Scheme.  14.   Per contra, under the MACP Scheme, financial upgradation  is granted in the next higher Grade Pay in the hierarchy of the  recommended Pay Bands and Grade Pay as given in Section-1,  Part-A of the First Schedule of CCS (Revised Pay) Rules, 2008.  Under the MACP Scheme, the financial upgradation would be on  non-functional basis subject to fitness in the hierarchy of Grade  Pay. MACP Scheme contemplates merely placement on personal  basis in the immediate higher Grade Pay/grant of financial  benefits only and shall not amount to actual/functional promotion  of the employees concerned (vide para (19) of the MACP  Scheme). In terms of para (20) of MACP Scheme, financial                                                                 12         upgradation under the MACP Scheme shall be purely personal to          the employees and shall have no relevance to the seniority          position. As such there shall be no additional financial          upgradation for the senior employees on the ground that the          junior employee in the grade has got higher pay/higher Grade          Pay under MACP Scheme (vide para (20) of the MACP Scheme).          15.     The distinction between the ACP Scheme and MACP          Scheme can be well understood by reference to the Pay Scale          under the Fifth Central Pay Commission and the revised pay          structure under the Sixth Central Pay Commission and the          corresponding Grade Pay thereon as stated in Section-1, Part-A          of the First Schedule of CCS (Revised Pay) Rules, 2008.

Upon implementation of the Sixth Central Pay Commission,  the Pay Scale of 3050-75-3950-80-4590 was kept in Pay Band-1  i.e. Rs.5200-20200 with Grade Pay of Rs.1900/-. Likewise, the  Pay Scale of 3200-85-4900 was kept in Pay Band-1 i.e. 5200-  20200 with Grade Pay of Rs.2000/-. Pay Scale of Upper Division  Clerk 4000-100-6000 was also kept in the same Pay Band-1 i.e.  5200-20200 but with Grade Pay of Rs.2400/-. Under the ACP  Scheme, the Government employee who was working as Lower  Division Clerk in the Pay Scale of 3050-75-3950-80-4590, on  completion of 12 years of service, would be entitled to the  financial upgradation in the next promotional hierarchy i.e. in the  cadre of UDC i.e. Pay Scale of 4000-100-6000 while working in  the same capacity as LDC. Whereas under the MACP Scheme,  the Government servant who is Lower Division Clerk in the Pay  Band-1 i.e. Rs.5200-20200/- with Grade Pay of Rs.1900/-, on  completion of 10 years of service upon grant of financial  upgradation, would be getting the immediate next higher Grade  Pay of Rs.2000/- and not the grade pay on promotional hierarchy.  Following the erstwhile ACP Scheme (as per which financial  upgradation   was    granted   in   promotional   hierarchy),   the  respondents are claiming the benefit of Grade Pay of Rs.4200/-                                                                  14 (which is in the next promotional hierarchy).       While the  respondents are granted financial upgradations as per the  prevailing rules of MACP Scheme, they can only claim the  immediate next higher Grade Pay and not the Grade Pay in the  next promotional hierarchy.  17.   As noted above, under the Sixth Pay Commission, scales of  pay of various hierarchies namely Lower Division Clerk and  Upper Division Clerk are all placed in the Pay Band-I i.e.  Rs.5200-20200, of course with different Grade Pay. When the  respondents are enjoying the benefit of the Sixth Pay  Commission by getting higher pay scale, they should go by the  Scheme in accepting what it gives on the financial upgradation;  but the respondents are claiming the best of the benefits from  both the ACP and MACP Schemes. The respondents have  already been granted the beneficial pay upgradation as per the  prevailing rules of MACP Scheme on the recommendation of the  Sixth Central Pay Commission. The previous ACP Scheme was  withdrawn and superseded by MACP Scheme with effect from  01.09.2008 based on the recommendation of the Sixth Central  Pay Commission. Under MACP Scheme, the respondent can only                                                                 15 claim immediate next Grade Pay and not the corresponding  Grade Pay in promotional hierarchy.  18.   As discussed earlier, in the ACP Scheme, there was no  Grade Pay but only fixed Pay Scales and fixed increments were  there. After the Sixth Central Pay Commission, various Pay  Scales have been clubbed together and there is revised Pay  Scale with corresponding Pay Bands and corresponding Grade  Pay. As discussed earlier, the norms for grant of ACP were  stringent and the government servant has to satisfy the norms for  promotion.   Whereas under the MACP Scheme, for financial  upgradation, the rigour of screening is diluted. For upgradation  under the MACP Scheme, the benchma"

They  were arrested on 25th October, 2018 for offence punishable under  Section 20(b)(ii)(c) of the NDPS Act.        After investigation, charge­  sheet    was   filed   on   17th   April,   2019.    Both     the   accused  respondents(A­1 and A­3) filed their respective post­arrest bail  application before the Sessions Judge, Thiruvananthapuram which  came to be dismissed after assigning cogent reasons under Order  dated 21st February, 2019 and both of them preferred their bail  application before the High Court. The High Court vide its order  dated 10th May, 2019 granted bail to          A­1 and A­3 in Crime No.                                                                            4 19/2018 and observed that both the accused have completed 195  days in judicial custody and their further detention is not necessary  as nothing remains to be investigated against them.        Although  Section 37 of NDPS Act has been referred to by the learned Single  Judge in the impugned order not for the purpose of showing its  compliance, but to justify due application of mind in taking decision  to grant post­arrest bail under Order dated 10 th May, 2019.  8.   It may also be noticed that respondent(A­5) was earlier  convicted under Section 55(a) of Abkari Act in S.C. 235/2005. At  the same time, for threatening witness in Crime No. 14/2018, a  separate Crime No. 38/2018 has been registered against him.  9.   Immediately after the post­arrest bail was granted by the  learned Single Judge, miscellaneous application was filed by the  appellant under Section 482 CrPC for recalling the orders of grant  of post­arrest bail to the accused respondents dated 10 th May,  2019.   The learned Single Judge after noticing the submissions  made in paragraph 16, that even if it was an erroneous order and it  did not involve application of mind, still it was not open for the  Court to reconsider the facts invoking Section 482 CrPC and                                                                      5 expressed its view that the remedy of the State lies in assailing the  orders of the Court before the superior forum, if so advised, and  dismissed the application vide order dated 12 th June, 2019 which is  also a subject matter of challenge before us.  10.   Mr. Ranjit Kumar, learned senior counsel for the appellant  submits that the High Court has committed an apparent error in  exercising discretion in favour of the accused respondents in  granting post­arrest bail to them without taking note of the  mandate of Section 37(1)(b)(ii) of the NDPS Act.  11.   Learned senior counsel further submits that negation of bail is  the rule, and its grant is an exception under Section 37(1)(b)(ii) of  the NDPS Act. For granting bail, the Court must, on the basis of  the record produced before it, be satisfied that there are reasonable  grounds for believing that the accused is not guilty of the offences  with which he has been charged, and further he is not likely to  commit any offence while on bail.  12.   Learned senior counsel further submits that the conditions for  granting bail, specified in Section 37(1)(b)(ii) are in addition to the  limitations provided under the CrPC, or any other law for the time                                                                       6 being in force regulating the grant of bail. Liberal approach in the  matter of bail under the NDPS Act is uncalled for. In support of his  submission, learned senior counsel has placed reliance on the  judgment of the three­Judge Bench of this Court reported in  Satpal Singh Vs. State of Punjab 2018(13) SCC 813.   13.   Per contra, Mr. R. Basant, learned senior counsel for the  respondents, while supporting the order passed by the High Court  impugned in the proceedings submits that in Crime No. 14/2018,  accused nos. 1 to 4 were granted post­arrest bail by the High Court  vide Orders dated 4th October, 2018, 20th February, 2019 and 25th  February, 2019 and the prosecution has not taken any steps to  challenge the grant of bail to all other accused persons.    In the  given circumstances, the post­arrest bail which has been granted to  respondent(A­5) in Crime No. 14/2018(Shajimon) does not call for  any interference.  14.   Learned senior counsel further submits that so far as Crime  No. 19/2018 is concerned, they have been falsely implicated by the  batchmates of the excise official, Babu Varghese, who was convicted  in a corruption case on the trap being laid down by respondent­                                                                    7 Shajimon who after trial, was convicted under Section 7 and  Section 13(1)(d) read with Section 13(2) of Prevention of Corruption  Act vide judgment dated 26th November, 2014 and later acquittal by  the High Court may not be of any significance.  15.   Learned senior counsel further submits that charge­sheet has  been filed in both the cases, i.e. Crime No. 14/2018 and Crime No.  19/2018 and the matter is fixed for framing of charge. No further  investigation is required from the accused respondents, and the  learned Single Judge under the impugned judgment has put  stringent   conditions   while   granting   post­arrest   bail   to   the  respondents, which has neither been misused nor violated and after  affording due opportunity of hearing and noticing Section 37 of the  NDPS Act, satisfaction has been recorded that the accused  respondents deserve post­arrest bail. Once the discretion has been  exercised by the learned Single Judge based on the facts on record,  interference with the discretion exercised in favour of the accused  respondents is not warranted.  16.   Learned senior counsel further submits that the High Court  was cognizant of the fact that the respondents had initiated                                                                          8 prosecution under the Prevention of Corruption Act against the  batchmate of the detecting officer and that such batchmate was  convicted of the offence under the Prevention of Corruption Act.  The High Court was obviously cognizant of the fact that it could be  a case of false implication on account of a prior animosity of the  detecting officer­colleagues convicted under the Prevention of  Corruption Act on the complaint of the respondent. There being no  prior case against the respondent under the NDPS Act, except these  two cases, and the judicial discretion having been exercised, no  interference is called for by this Court.  17.   It may be noticed that Hashish oil is shown at Sl. No. 13 in the  notification dated 19th October, 2001 issued by the Central  Government in exercise of power under Section 2(viia) and (xxiiia) of  the NDPS Act. Hashish oil above 1 kg is commercial quantity.  18.   The jurisdiction of the Court to grant bail is circumscribed by  the provisions of Section 37 of the NDPS Act. It can be granted in  case there are reasonable grounds for believing that accused is not  guilty of such offence, and that he is not likely to commit any  offence while on bail. It is the mandate of the legislature which is                                                                       9 required to be followed. At this juncture, a reference to Section 37  of the Act is apposite. That provision makes the offences under the  Act cognizable and non­bailable. It reads thus:­          “37. Offences to be cognizable and non­bailable.—(1)         Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal         Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974),—               (a) every offence punishable under this Act shall              be cognizable;               (b) no person accused of an offence punishable for              [offences under section 19 or section 24 or section              27A and also for offences involving commercial              quantity] shall be released on bail or on his own              bond unless—                    (i) the Public Prosecutor has been given an                   opportunity to oppose the application for                   such release, and                    (ii) where the Public Prosecutor opposes                   the application, the court is satisfied                   that there are reasonable grounds for                   believing that he is not guilty of such                   offence and that he is not likely to                   commit any offence while on bail.          (2) The limitations on granting of bail specified in clause (b)         of sub­section (1) are in addition to the limitations under         the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974), or any         other law for the time being in force on granting of bail.”                                                   (emphasis supplied)                                                                               10 19.   This Court has laid down broad parameters to be followed  while considering the application for bail moved by the accused  involved in offences under NDPS Act. In Union of India Vs. Ram  Samujh and Ors. 1999(9) SCC 429, it has been elaborated as  under:­             “7. It is to be borne in mind that the aforesaid legislative           mandate is required to be adhered to and followed. It           should be borne in mind that in a murder case, the accused           commits murder of one or two persons, while those persons           who are dealing in narcotic drugs are instrumental in           causing death or in inflicting death­blow to a number of           innocent young victims, who are vulnerable; it causes           deleterious effects and a deadly impact on the society; they           are a hazard to the society; even if they are released           temporarily, in all probability, they would continue their           nefarious activities of trafficking and/or dealing in           intoxicants clandestinely. Reason may be large stake and           illegal profit involved. This Court, dealing with the           contention with regard to punishment under the NDPS Act,           has succinctly observed about the adverse effect of such           activities in Durand Didier v. Chief Secy., Union Territory of           Goa [(1990) 1 SCC 95)] as under:                24. With deep concern, we may point out that the               organised activities of the underworld and the               clandestine smuggling of narcotic drugs and               psychotropic substances into this country and               illegal trafficking in such drugs and substances               have led to drug addiction among a sizeable               section of the public, particularly the adolescents               and students of both sexes and the menace has               assumed serious and alarming proportions in the               recent years. Therefore, in order to effectively               control and eradicate this proliferating and               booming devastating menace, causing deleterious               effects and deadly impact on the society as a                                                                             11              whole, Parliament in its wisdom, has made              effective provisions by introducing this Act 81 of              1985       specifying     mandatory      minimum              imprisonment and fine.          8. To check the menace of dangerous drugs flooding the         market, Parliament has provided that the person accused of         offences under the NDPS Act should not be released on bail         during trial unless the mandatory conditions provided in         Section 37, namely,            (i) there are reasonable grounds for believing that the                accused is not guilty of such offence; and            (ii) that he is not likely to commit any offence while                on bail are satisfied. The High Court has not given                any justifiable reason for not abiding by the                aforesaid mandate while ordering the release of                the respondent­accused on bail. Instead of                attempting to take a holistic view of the harmful                socio­economic consequences and health hazards                which would accompany trafficking illegally in                dangerous drugs, the court should implement the                law in the spirit with which Parliament, after due                deliberation, has amended.”    20.   The scheme of Section 37 reveals that the exercise of power to  grant bail is not only subject to the limitations contained under  Section 439 of the CrPC, but is also subject to the limitation placed  by Section 37 which commences with non­obstante clause.              The  operative part of the said section is in the negative form prescribing  the enlargement of bail to any person accused of commission of an  offence under the Act, unless twin conditions are satisfied. The first                                                                        12 condition is that the prosecution must be given an opportunity to  oppose the application; and the second, is that the Court must be  satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that he is  not guilty of such offence. If either of these two conditions is not  satisfied, the ban for granting bail operates.  21.   The expression “reasonable grounds” means something more  than prima facie grounds.      It contemplates substantial probable  causes for believing that the accused is not guilty of the alleged  offence.   The reasonable belief contemplated in the provision  requires existence of such facts and circumstances as are sufficient  in themselves to justify satisfaction that the accused is not guilty of  the alleged offence. In the case on hand, the High Court seems to  have completely overlooked the underlying object of Section 37 that  in addition to the limitations provided under the CrPC, or any other  law for the time being in force, regulating the grant of bail, its  liberal approach in the matter of bail under the NDPS Act is indeed  uncalled for.  22.   We may further like to observe that the learned Single Judge  has failed to record a finding mandated under Section 37 of the                                                                       13 NDPS Act which is a sine qua non for granting bail to the accused  under the NDPS Act.  23.   The submission made by learned counsel for the respondents  that in Crime No. 14/2018, the bail has been granted to the other  accused persons(A­1 to A­4), and no steps have been taken by the  prosecution to challenge the grant of post­arrest bail to the other  accused persons, is of no consequence for the reason that the  consideration prevailed upon the Court to grant bail to the other  accused   persons   will   not   absolve   the   act   of   the   accused  respondent(A­5) from the rigour of Section 37 of the NDPS Act.  24.   The further submission of the learned counsel for the  respondents that they have been falsely implicated in Crime No.  19/2018 for the reason that the batchmates of the excise official,  Babu Varghese was convicted in the corruption case on the trap  being laid down by the respondent­Shajimon(A­1) is only a  conjecture of self­defence, and no inference could be drawn of false  implication, more so when in Crime No. 19/2018 and 14/2018,  charge­sheets have been filed after investigation and the matter is  listed before the learned trial Judge for framing of the charge where                                                                         14 the accused respondents certainly have an opportunity to make  their submissions.  25.   That apart, in the application which was filed before the  learned Single Judge of the High Court by the appellant under  Section 482 CrPC, the learned Single Judge has also prima facie  accepted that error has been committed in granting bail to the  accused respondents as observed in para 16 of the impugned  judgment as under:­          “ On going through the orders granted on 10.5.2019         allowing bail applications of A1 and A3 on the one hand and         5th accused on the other hand in NDPS crime Nos. 19/2018         and 14/2018 respectively, I find that the bail was granted         by the Court after being cognizant of the principles laid         down in Section 37 of the Act whether it ultimately turned         out to be right or wrong. May be as regards 3 rd accused was         concerned, order was passed under misconception of facts.         Likewise, the criminal antecedents concerning the first         accused did not fall to the notice of this Court. What could         at the most be said of the order passed by this Court is that         it was erroneous or it did not involve application of mind.         But then the question arises is whether the same court         could under law reconsider the facts invoking Section 482         of the Code. I am of the opinion that the remedy of the         State lay in challenging the orders of this Court, if it was         really aggrieved, before a superior forum and not before the         same court. Therefore, accepting the argument of the         learned counsel for the accused, I hold that none of the         applications seeking to recall the order of this Court is         maintainable under law.”                                                 (emphasis supplied)                                                                             15 26.   In the result, the appeals are allowed and the impugned order  passed by the High Court releasing the respondents on bail is  hereby set aside.    Bail bonds of the accused respondents stand  cancelled and they are directed to be taken into custody. The trial  Court is directed to proceed and expedite the trial.  27.   Pending application(s), if any, stand disposed of.                                                 ……………………………J.

The learned Company Judge in the Delhi High Court  passed the following order in the aforesaid petition on 27.08.2018:                                “ORDER                              27.08.2018      1. This petition is filed under sections 433(e) and (f), 434      and 439 of the Company Act, 1956 (hereinafter referred      to as ‘the Act’) seeking winding up of the respondent      company.      2. It has been pleaded in the petition that the respondent      company had approached the petitioner company for      supply of Iron Pellets. A specified quantity of      11612.34MTs of the goods was supplied to the      respondent company. After making partial payment, a      sum of Rs.4,55,00,000/- is due and payable by the      respondent company to the petitioner. The respondent      company from time to time issued 17 post-dated cheques.      However, 13 of the cheques when presented with its      bankers, were returned by the bankers unpaid. Statutory      notice was issued on 15.06.2016 but no payments have      been received by the petitioner.      3. No reply has been filed by the respondent. On the last      date of hearing, the learned counsel for the respondent      had taken time to settle the matter with the petitioner.      4. Today, the learned counsel for the respondent company      submits that the respondent is not in a position to settle      the matter on account of the fact that the unit of the      respondent is shut.      5. In these circumstances, the petition is admitted and the                                                                        2      Official Liquidator attached to this Court is appointed as      the Liquidator. He is directed to take over all the assets,      books of accounts and records of the respondent-      company forthwith. The citations be published in the Delhi      editions of the newspapers ‘Statesman’ (English) and      ‘Veer Arjun’ (Hindi), as well as in the Delhi Gazette, at      least 14 days prior to the next date of hearing. The cost of      publication is to be borne by the petitioner who shall      deposit a sum Rs.75,000/- with the Official Liquidator      within 2 weeks, subject to any further amounts that may      be called for by the liquidator for this purpose, if required.      The Official Liquidator shall also endeavour to prepare a      complete inventory of all the assets of the respondent-      company when the same are taken over; and the      premises in which they are kept shall be sealed by him. At      the same time, he may also seek the assistance of a      valuer to value all assets to facilitate the process of      winding up. It will also be open to the Official Liquidator to      seek police help in the discharge of his duties, if he      considers it appropriate to do so. The Official Liquidator to      take all further steps that may be necessary in this regard      to protect the premises and assets of the respondent-      company.      6. List on 09.01.2019.      7. A copy of this order be given dasti under the signatures      of the court master.”   2.2. An application was then filed before the learned Company  Judge by the State Bank of India [“SBI”] (Respondent No. 2 herein),  being a secured creditor of the appellant company, seeking transfer  of the winding up petition to the NCLT in view of the fact that SBI had  filed an application under section 7 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy  Code, 2016 [“Code”] which was pending before the NCLT. By order  dated 14.01.2019, the learned Company Judge transferred the                                                                             3 winding up petition as prayed for as follows:                                 “ORDER                               14.01.2019      CA No.1240/2018      1. This application is filed seeking transfer of the present      petition being Co.Pet. No.731/2016 to NCLT. This      application has been filed by State Bank of India stating      that an application under section 7 of the IBC is pending      before NCLT. It has been pleaded that the respondent      company had failed to pay outstanding dues of about      Rs.722 crores to the applicant bank and hence this      proceeding have been initiated before NCLT. The      applicant bank is also a lead bank of the consortium of      banks which have outstanding dues of about Rs.1100      crores.      2. This court had admitted the present winding up petition      on 27.08.2018 and appointed the OL as the provisional      liquidator of the respondent company.      3. The learned counsel appearing for the OL submits that      the OL has already sealed the registered office of the      respondent company at New Delhi and factory premises      at Orissa. He further submits that the OL has incurred      heavy expenses in protecting the factory premises at      Orissa in the given facts and circumstances.      4. The Ex. Management however objects to transfer of      this petition. They have submitted that they have had no      opportunity to defend the proceedings before NCLT.      5. Learned counsel for SBI states that the creditors will      reimburse the expenses of the OL.      6. Section 434 of the Companies Act, 2013 reads as      follows:          “[434. Transfer of certain pending proceedings–(1)          On such date as may be notified by the Central          Government in this behalf,—             (a) all matters, proceedings or cases pending             before the Board of Company Law             Administration (herein in this section referred             to as the Company Law Board) constituted                                                                      4 under sub-section (1) of section 10E of the Companies Act, 1956 (1 of 1956), immediately before such date shall stand transferred to the Tribunal and the Tribunal shall dispose of such matters, proceedings or cases in accordance with the provisions of this Act; (b) any person aggrieved by any decision or order of the Company Law Board made before such date may file an appeal to the High Court within sixty days from the date of communication of the decision or order of the Company Law Board to him on any question of law arising out of such order: Provided that the High Court may if it is satisfied that the appellant was prevented by sufficient cause from filing an appeal within the said period, allow it to be filed within a further period not exceeding sixty days; and (c) all proceedings under the Companies Act, 1956 (1 of 1956), including proceedings relating     to     arbitration,    compromise, arrangements and reconstruction and winding up of companies, pending immediately before such date before any District Court or High Court, shall stand transferred to the Tribunal and the Tribunal may proceed to deal with such proceedings from the stage before their transfer:     Provided that only such proceedings relating to the winding up of companies shall be transferred to the Tribunal that are at a stage as may be prescribed by the Central Government.     [Provided further that any party or parties to any proceedings relating to the winding up of companies pending before any Court immediately before the commencement of the Insolvency       and       Bankruptcy       Code (Amendment) Ordinance, 2018, may file an application for transfer of such proceedings and the Court may by order transfer such proceedings to the Tribunal and the                                                       5            proceedings so transferred shall be dealt with            by the Tribunal as an application for initiation            of corporate insolvency resolution process            under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code,            2016.”      7. This court has already in CP 152/2016 vide decision      dated 27.9.2018 in Rajni Anand vs. Cosmic Structures      Limited held that the power under section 434(1)(c) of the      Companies Act, 2013 for transfer of a petition to NCLT is      discretionary and has to be exercised in the facts and      circumstances of the case so as to expeditiously deal with      the proceedings/winding up.      8. In my opinion, it would be in the interest of justice and      in the interest of the respondent company and the      creditors that the matter be transferred to NCLT in      exercise of the discretionary powers of the court under      section 434 of the Companies Act, 1956. The order      appointing the OL is a recent order and not much time      has elapsed since then. The OL has only taken steps to      seize the office of the respondent company and the      factory premises and further exercise is yet to be carried      out. The application is allowed as above. The present      petition is transferred to NCLT.      CO.PET. 731/2016      9. In view of the above order, the present petition is      transferred to NCLT. All pending applications, if any, stand      disposed of. The order admitting the petition and      appointing the OL as the provisional liquidator dated      27.08.2018 stands revoked.      10. The OL will give details of necessary expenses to SBI.      The costs/expenses will be borne by SBI and also      consortium of banks. The OL will hand over the      possession of the assets as directed by NCLT.      11. Parties to appear before NCLT on 04.02.2019.”   2.3. It is from this order that the appellant company’s appeal to the  Division Bench has been dismissed by the impugned order in which                                                                           6 the learned Division Bench held as follows:       “41. The process under IBC is meant to find the best      possible solution in a given case, which is beneficial to      the company concerned as well as its creditors and other      stakeholders. Therefore, in the interest of equity and      justice, and keeping in mind the special nature of the IBC,      if the Learned Company Judge has found it fit to transfer      the winding up petition to NCLT on the application of      respondent No. SBI– who is a secured creditor, this Court      would not ordinarily interfere with the judgment of the      Learned Company Judge, and that too, on the asking of      the erstwhile management. The Learned Company Judge      rightly recalled the order of appointment of Official      Liquidator and admission of petition, since the liquidation      was at its initial stage and the learned Company Judge      was fully competent to do so. After the passing of the      winding up order, the OL had not proceeded to take any      effective or irreversible steps towards liquidation of the      assets of the appellant company. All that he appears to      have done is to take possession and control of the      registered office of the appellant company and its factory      premises and its records and books.      42. Pertinently, the respondent No. 2 has already initiated      proceedings before the NCLT in respect of the appellant      company which, in any event, would continue. The      continuation of the liquidation proceedings at the hands of      the OL in terms of the order passed by this Court would      be incongruous with the proceedings that the NCLT has      undertaken and would undertake under the IBC.      Continuation of two parallel proceedings – one before the      Company Court for liquidation, and the other before the      IBC for resolution/ revival, would serve no useful purpose.      The statutory scheme found in Section 434(1)(c) clearly is      that the proceedings for winding up pending before the      Company Court could be transferred to the NCLT and      there is no provision for transfer of proceedings from the      NCLT to the Company Court.      43. We, thus uphold the impugned order passed by the      Ld. Company Judge in C.A. No. 1240/2018, dated      14.01.2019 and dismiss the appeal.”                                                                     7 3.   Shri Sidharth Luthra, learned Senior Advocate appearing on  behalf of the appellant company, referred to three judgments of this  Court,   namely,   Jaipur   Metals    &    Electricals   Employees  Organization v. Jaipur Metals & Electricals Ltd., (2019) 4 SCC 227  [“Jaipur Metals”], Forech India Ltd. v. Edelweiss Assets  Reconstruction Co. Ltd., 2019 SCCOnLine SC 87 [“Forech”], and  M/s Kaledonia Jute & Fibres Pvt. Ltd. v. M/s Axis Nirman &  Industries Ltd. & Ors., 2020 SCCOnLine SC 943 [“Kaledonia”].  According to him, none of the judgments apply to the facts of the  present case inasmuch as, on the facts in the present case, once a  winding up order has been passed by the Company Judge, winding  up proceedings alone must continue before the High Court and  parallel proceedings under the Code cannot continue. He argued that  Jaipur Metals (supra) makes it clear that even independent  proceedings under the Code can only continue when the stage is  before a winding up order is passed, which was the case on the facts  before the Court. Likewise, in Forech (supra) also, the stage of the  winding up proceeding was post service of notice of the winding up  petition and before a winding up order was passed, as a result of  which the 5th proviso to section 434(1)(c) of the Companies Act, 2013  was applied. Likewise, in Kaledonia (supra), though a winding up                                                                            8 order had been passed on the facts of that case, the aforesaid order  had been kept in abeyance. On facts therefore, these three cases are  entirely distinguishable and would have no application to a scenario  in which a winding up order has been passed and the Official  Liquidator has in fact seized the assets of the company in order to  begin the process of distribution to creditors and others which would  ultimately result in dissolution of the company.   4.    Shri K.K. Venugopal, learned Attorney General for India  appearing on behalf of SBI, countered all these submissions.  According to him, this Court has unequivocally laid down that the 5 th  proviso to section 434(1)(c) of the Companies Act, 2013 now makes it  clear that a discretion is vested in the Company Court to transfer  winding up proceedings to the NCLT without reference to the stage of  winding up. Even post admission, according to the learned Attorney  General, if no irreversible steps have been taken, then a combined  reading of the 5th proviso to section 434(1)(c) and section 238 of the  Code would lead to the result that the winding up proceeding be  transferred to the NCLT, as not only is the Code a special enactment  with a non-obstante clause which would, in cases of conflict, do away  with the Companies Act, 2013, but also that, given the judgment of  this Court in Swiss Ribbons Pvt. Ltd. & Anr. v. Union of India &                                                                            9 Ors., (2019) 4 SCC 17 [“Swiss Ribbons”], winding up is a last resort  after all efforts to revive a company fail. According to him, the  discretion exercised by the Company Court and the Division Bench  has been judiciously and correctly exercised, warranting no  interference at our hands.   5.    In Swiss Ribbons (supra), this Court had occasion to deal with  the raison d’être for the enactment of the Code. The judgment of this  Court referred to the Statement of Objects and Reasons for the Code  as follows:        “25. The Statement of Objects and Reasons for the Code       have been referred to in Innoventive Industries       [Innoventive Industries Ltd. v. ICICI Bank, (2018) 1 SCC       407 : (2018) 1 SCC (Civ) 356] which states: (SCC pp.       421-22, para 12)              “12. … The Statement of Objects and Reasons          of the Code reads as under:             ‘Statement of Objects and Reasons.—There is          no single law in India that deals with insolvency and          bankruptcy. Provisions relating to insolvency and          bankruptcy for companies can be found in the Sick          Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act,          1985, the Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and          Financial Institutions Act, 1993, the Securitisation          and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and          Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 and the          Companies Act, 2013. These statutes provide for          creation of multiple fora such as Board of Industrial          and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR), Debts          Recovery Tribunal (DRT) and National Company          Law Tribunal (NCLT) and their respective Appellate          Tribunals. Liquidation of companies is handled by          the High Courts. Individual bankruptcy and                                                                         10 insolvency is dealt with under the Presidency Towns Insolvency Act, 1909, and the Provincial Insolvency Act, 1920 and is dealt with by the courts. The existing framework for insolvency and bankruptcy is inadequate, ineffective and results in undue delays in resolution, therefore, the proposed legislation.    2.The objective of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2015 is to consolidate and amend the laws relating to reorganisation and insolvency resolution of corporate persons, partnership firms and individuals in a time-bound manner for maximisation of value of assets of such persons, to promote entrepreneurship, availability of credit and balance the interests of all the stakeholders including alteration in the priority of payment of government dues and to establish an Insolvency and Bankruptcy Fund, and matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. An effective legal framework for timely resolution of insolvency and bankruptcy would support development of credit markets and encourage entrepreneurship. It would also improve Ease of Doing Business, and facilitate more investments leading to higher economic growth and development.     3. The Code seeks to provide for designating NCLT and DRT as the adjudicating authorities for corporate persons and firms and individuals, respectively, for resolution of insolvency, liquidation and bankruptcy. The Code separates commercial aspects of insolvency and bankruptcy proceedings from judicial aspects. The Code also seeks to provide for establishment of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Board) for regulation of insolvency professionals, insolvency professional agencies and information utilities. Till the Board is established, the Central Government shall exercise all powers of the Board or designate any financial sector regulator to exercise the powers and functions of the Board. Insolvency professionals will assist in completion of insolvency resolution, liquidation and bankruptcy proceedings envisaged                                                            11         in the Code. Information Utilities would collect,         collate, authenticate and disseminate financial         information to facilitate such proceedings. The Code         also proposes to establish a fund to be called the         Insolvency and Bankruptcy Fund of India for the         purposes specified in the Code.            4. The Code seeks to provide for amendments in         the Indian Partnership Act, 1932, the Central Excise         Act, 1944, Customs Act, 1962, the Income Tax Act,         1961, the Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and         Financial Institutions Act, 1993, the Finance Act,         1994, the Securitisation and Reconstruction of         Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security         Interest Act, 2002, the Sick Industrial Companies         (Special Provisions) Repeal Act, 2003, the Payment         and Settlement Systems Act, 2007, the Limited         Liability Partnership Act, 2008, and the Companies         Act, 2013.            5. The Code seeks to achieve the above         objectives.’”                                   (emphasis in original)  The Court then went on to state:       “27. As is discernible, the Preamble gives an insight into      what is sought to be achieved by the Code. The Code is      first and foremost, a Code for reorganisation and      insolvency resolution of corporate debtors. Unless such      reorganisation is effected in a time-bound manner, the      value of the assets of such persons will deplete.      Therefore, maximisation of value of the assets of such      persons so that they are efficiently run as going concerns      is another very important objective of the Code. This, in      turn, will promote entrepreneurship as the persons in      management of the corporate debtor are removed and      replaced by entrepreneurs. When, therefore, a resolution      plan takes off and the corporate debtor is brought back      into the economic mainstream, it is able to repay its      debts, which, in turn, enhances the viability of credit in the      hands of banks and financial institutions. Above all,      ultimately, the interests of all stakeholders are looked after                                                                        12 as the corporate debtor itself becomes a beneficiary of the resolution scheme—workers are paid, the creditors in the long run will be repaid in full, and shareholders/investors are able to maximise their investment. Timely resolution of a corporate debtor who is in the red, by an effective legal framework, would go a long way to support the development of credit markets. Since more investment can be made with funds that have come back into the economy, business then eases up, which leads, overall, to higher economic growth and development of the Indian economy. What is interesting to note is that the Preamble does not, in any manner, refer to liquidation, which is only availed of as a last resort if there is either no resolution plan or the resolution plans submitted are not up to the mark. Even in liquidation, the liquidator can sell the business of the corporate debtor as a going concern. (See ArcelorMittal [ArcelorMittal (India) (P) Ltd. v. Satish Kumar Gupta, (2019) 2 SCC 1] at para 83, fn 3). 28. It can thus be seen that the primary focus of the legislation is to ensure revival and continuation of the corporate debtor by protecting the corporate debtor from its own management and from a corporate death by liquidation. The Code is thus a beneficial legislation which puts the corporate debtor back on its feet, not being a mere recovery legislation for creditors. The interests of the corporate debtor have, therefore, been bifurcated and separated from that of its promoters/those who are in management. Thus, the resolution process is not adversarial to the corporate debtor but, in fact, protective of its interests. The moratorium imposed by Section 14 is in the interest of the corporate debtor itself, thereby preserving the assets of the corporate debtor during the resolution process. The timelines within which the resolution process is to take place again protects the corporate debtor's assets from further dilution, and also protects all its creditors and workers by seeing that the resolution process goes through as fast as possible so that another management can, through its entrepreneurial skills, resuscitate the corporate debtor to achieve all these ends.”                                                                   13 Having so held, the Court ended stating:       “Epilogue      120. The Insolvency Code is a legislation which deals      with economic matters and, in the larger sense, deals with      the economy of the country as a whole. Earlier      experiments, as we have seen, in terms of legislations      having failed, “trial” having led to repeated “errors”,      ultimately led to the enactment of the Code. The      experiment contained in the Code, judged by the      generality of its provisions and not by so-called crudities      and inequities that have been pointed out by the      petitioners, passes constitutional muster. To stay      experimentation in things economic is a grave      responsibility, and denial of the right to experiment is      fraught with serious consequences to the nation. We have      also seen that the working of the Code is being monitored      by the Central Government by Expert Committees that      have been set up in this behalf. Amendments have been      made in the short period in which the Code has operated,      both to the Code itself as well as to subordinate      legislation made under it. This process is an ongoing      process which involves all stakeholders, including the      petitioners.      121. We are happy to note that in the working of the      Code, the flow of financial resource to the commercial      sector in India has increased exponentially as a result of      financial debts being repaid. Approximately 3300 cases      have been disposed of by the adjudicating authority      based on out-of-court settlements between corporate      debtors and creditors which themselves involved claims      amounting to over INR 1,20,390 crores. Eighty cases      have since been resolved by resolution plans being      accepted. Of these eighty cases, the liquidation value of      sixty-three such cases is INR 29,788.07 crores. However,      the amount realised from the resolution process is in the      region of INR 60,000 crores, which is over 202% of the      liquidation value. As a result of this, Reserve Bank of      India has come out with figures which reflect these      results. Thus, credit that has been given by banks and      financial institutions to the commercial sector (other than                                                                     14      food) has jumped up from INR 4952.24 crores in 2016-      2017, to INR 9161.09 crores in 2017-2018, and to INR      13,195.20 crores for the first six months of 2018-2019.      Equally, credit flow from non-banks has gone up from INR      6819.93 crores in 2016-2017, to INR 4718 crores for the      first six months of 2018-2019. Ultimately, the total flow of      resources to the commercial sector in India, both bank      and non-bank, and domestic and foreign (relatable to the      non-food sector) has gone up from a total of INR      14,530.47 crores in 2016-2017, to INR 18,469.25 crores      in 2017-2018, and to INR 18,798.20 crores in the first six      months of 2018-2019. These figures show that the      experiment conducted in enacting the Code is proving to      be largely successful. The defaulter's paradise is lost. In      its place, the economy's rightful position has been      regained. The result is that all the petitions will now be      disposed of in terms of this judgment. There will be no      order as to costs.”   6.   Viewed in this backdrop, let us now examine some of the  judgments of this Court dealing with transfer of winding up petitions  from the Company Court to be tried by the NCLT under the Code.   7.   Section 255 of the Code reads as follows:       “255. Amendments of Act 18 of 2013.—The Companies      Act, 2013 shall be amended in the manner specified in      the Eleventh Schedule.”  In pursuance of this section, the Eleventh Schedule to the Code  made various amendments to the Companies Act, 2013. They have  been set out in detail in Jaipur Metals (supra) in paragraphs 10 and  11. Suffice it to say that the first step to transferring winding up  proceedings to the NCLT was taken by the Companies (Transfer of                                                                          15 Pending Proceedings) Rules, 2016 [“Transfer Rules, 2016”], which  compulsorily transferred all winding up proceedings pending before  High Courts to the NCLT at a stage prior to the service of the petition  in terms of Rule 26 of the Companies (Court) Rules, 1959. By an  amendment made on 17.08.2018, the 5 th proviso to section 434(1)(c)  was added which states as follows:       “434. Transfer of certain pending proceedings.—(1)      On such date as may be notified by the Central      Government in this behalf,—      (a) xxx xxx xxx      (b) xxx xxx xxx      (c) all proceedings under the Companies Act, 1956,      including proceedings relating to arbitration, compromise,      arrangements and reconstruction and winding up of      companies, pending immediately before such date before      any District Court or High Court, shall stand transferred to      the Tribunal and the Tribunal may proceed to deal with      such proceedings from the stage before their transfer:      xxx xxx xxx         Provided further that any party or parties to any      proceedings relating to the winding up of companies      pending before any Court immediately before the      commencement of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code      (Amendment) Ordinance, 2018, may file an application for      transfer of such proceedings and the Court may by order      transfer such proceedings to the Tribunal and the      proceedings so transferred shall be dealt with by the      Tribunal as an application for initiation of corporate      insolvency resolution process under the Insolvency and      Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (31 of 2016).”   8.   The Court in Jaipur Metals (supra) was directly concerned with  a special category of cases dealt with by Rule 5(2) of the aforesaid                                                                             16 Transfer Rules which was omitted later on. Despite the omission, the  Court applied this Rule, read with the amendment made to section  434 of the Companies Act, 2013 on 17.08.2018, stating:       “17. However, though the language of Rule 5(2) is plain      enough, it has been argued before us that Rule 5 was      substituted on 29-6-2017, as a result of which, Rule 5(2)      has been omitted. The effect of the omission of Rule 5(2)      is not to automatically transfer all cases under Section 20      of the SIC Act to NCLT, as otherwise, a specific rule would      have to be framed transferring such cases to NCLT, as      has been done in Rule 5(1). The real reason for omission      of Rule 5(2) in the substituted Rule 5 is because it is      necessary to state, only once, on the repeal of the SIC      Act, that proceedings under Section"

IA No.62372/2020-CONDONATION OF DELAY IN FILING                             1.      The Special Leave Petition has been filed with a                           delay     of    663     days!      The     explanation      given      in     the                           application      for    condonation         of   delay     is    set    out    in                           paragraphs 3 and 4.                            2.      We are constrained to pen down a detailed order as                           it   appears    that        all   our    counseling   to    Government        and Signature Not Verified  Digitally signed by ASHA SUNDRIYAL Date: 2020.10.16         Government authorities have fallen on deaf ears i.e., the 20:45:32 IST Reason:                            Supreme    Court       of     India     cannot   be   a    place       for    the                                                                             2  Governments    to   walk     in   when   they   choose    ignoring    the  period of limitation prescribed. We have raised the issue  that if the Government machinery is so inefficient and  incapable     of    filing    appeals/petitions        in    time,    the  solution may lie in requesting the Legislature to expand  the   time   period    for    filing     limitation    for   Government  authorities because of their gross incompetence.                That is  not so. Till the Statute subsists, the appeals/petitions  have to be filed as per the Statues prescribed.   3.     No doubt, some leeway is given for the Government  inefficiencies but the sad part is that the authorities  keep on relying on judicial pronouncements for a period of  time when technology had not advanced and a greater leeway  was given to the Government (Collector, Land Acquisition,  Anantnag & Anr vs. Mst. Katiji & Ors. (1987) 2 SCC 107).  This position is more than elucidated by the judgment of  this Court in Office of the Chief Post Master General &  Ors. v. Living Media India Ltd. & Anr. (2012) 3 SCC 563  where the Court observed as under:          “12) It is not in dispute that the person(s)        concerned were well aware or conversant with        the    issues   involved     including    the     prescribed        period of limitation for taking up the matter        by way of filing a special leave petition in                                                                         3  this Court. They cannot claim that they have a separate        period      of     limitation       when         the Department was possessed with competent persons familiar with court proceedings. In the absence of plausible and acceptable explanation, we are posing     a    question     why    the    delay    is     to     be condoned        mechanically        merely        because        the Government or a wing of the Government is a party before us.  Though we are conscious of the fact that in a matter of condonation of delay when there was no gross negligence or deliberate inaction or lack of   bonafide,      a   liberal    concession       has     to    be adopted to advance substantial justice, we are of the view that in the facts and circumstances, the Department cannot take advantage of various earlier    decisions.        The   claim     on    account        of impersonal machinery and inherited bureaucratic methodology of making several notes cannot be accepted       in   view    of   the   modern     technologies being used and available. The law of limitation undoubtedly         binds    everybody       including           the Government.  13) In our view, it is the right time to inform all the government bodies, their agencies and instrumentalities           that       unless       they         have reasonable      and     acceptable     explanation        for    the delay and there was bonafide effort, there is no need to accept the usual explanation that the file was kept pending for several months/years                                                                                     4         due to considerable degree of procedural red-        tape in the process. The government departments        are under a special obligation to ensure that        they     perform      their   duties   with    diligence      and        commitment. Condonation of delay is an exception        and should not be used as an anticipated benefit        for      government     departments.    The     law    shelters        everyone under the same light and should not be        swirled for the benefit of a few. Considering        the fact that there was no proper explanation        offered by the Department for the delay except        mentioning of various dates, according to us,        the Department has miserably failed to give any        acceptable      and     cogent    reasons     sufficient      to        condone such a huge delay.”             Eight     years     hence    the   judgment       is    still        unheeded!     4.     A reading of the aforesaid application shows that  the reason for such an inordinate delay is stated to be  only   “due     to   unavailability      of   the    documents     and     the  process    of    arranging     the   documents”.     In    paragraph       4    a  reference has been made to “bureaucratic process works, it  is inadvertent that delay occurs”.   5.     A     preposterous       proposition     is        sought    to         be  propounded that if there is some merit in the case, the                                                                              5  period of delay is to be given a go-by.                   If a case is  good on merits, it will succeed in any case. It is really  a bar of limitation which can even shut out good cases.  This does not, of course, take away the jurisdiction of  the Court in an appropriate case to condone the delay.   6.     We are also of the view that the aforesaid approach  is being adopted in what we have categorized earlier as  “certificate cases”. The object appears to be to obtain a  certificate of dismissal from the Supreme Court to put a  quietus to the issue and thus, say that nothing could be  done because the highest Court has dismissed the appeal.  It is to complete this formality and save the skin of  officers who may be at default that such a process is  followed.    We     have    on   earlier   occasions      also    strongly  deprecated such a practice and process.               There seems to be  no improvement.        The purpose of coming to this Court is  not   to   obtain    such   certificates       and   if   the   Government  suffers    losses,    it    is   time   when   the   concerned    officer  responsible for the same bears the consequences. The irony  is that in none of the cases any action is taken against  the officers, who sit on the files and do nothing.                  It is  presumed that this Court will condone the delay and even  in making submissions, straight away counsels appear to                                                                                         6  address on merits without referring even to the aspect of  limitation as happened in this case till we pointed out to  the counsel that he must first address us on the question  of limitation.   7.       We are thus, constrained to send a signal and we  propose to do in all matters today, where there are such  inordinate       delays          that     the       Government       or         State  authorities      coming      before       us   must     pay    for   wastage      of  judicial time which has its own value.                        Such costs can be  recovered from the officers responsible.   8.       Looking      to   the     period      of     delay    and   the    casual  manner    in   which       the     application        has     been   worded,      we  consider appropriate to impose costs on the petitioner-  State of Rs.25,000/- (Rupees twenty five thousand) to be  deposited      with    the    Mediation         and    Conciliation        Project  Committee.       The amount be deposited in four weeks. The  amount be recovered from the officers responsible for the  delay     in   filing        the    special         leave     petition      and    a  certificate of recovery of the said amount be also filed  in this Court within the said period of time.   9.       The   special     leave        petition      is    dismissed      as   time  barred in terms aforesaid.                                                              7  10.   We make it clear that if the aforesaid order is not  complied within time, we will be constrained to initiate  contempt proceedings against the Chief Secretary.   11.   A copy of the order be placed before the Chief  Secretary, State of Madhya Pradesh.                                         ....................J.

The factual background is that a juvenile ‘X’ is alleged to  have committed an offence punishable under Section 304 of the  Indian Penal Code,1860 (IPC for short) which offence is  punishable with a maximum punishment of imprisonment for life  or up to 10 years and fine in the first part and imprisonment up  to 10 years or fine, or both in the second part.     No minimum  sentence is prescribed.  4.   The deceased in the motor vehicle accident was the brother  of the appellant herein. The juvenile at the time of occurrence  was above 16 years but below 18 years.       The Juvenile Justice  Board vide order dated 04.06.2016 held that juvenile ‘X’ has  committed a heinous offence, and, therefore should be tried as an  adult. The appeal filed to the Children’s Court was also dismissed  on 11.02.2019. Thereafter, the juvenile ‘X’, through his mother  approached the High Court of Delhi, which vide order 01.05.2019  held that since no minimum sentence is prescribed for the  offence in question, the said offence did not fall within the ambit  of Section 2(33) of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of  Children) Act, 2015. This order is under challenge in this appeal.                                                                       2 5.    We have heard Mr. Siddharth Luthra, learned senior  counsel for the appellant and Mr. Mukul Rohatgi, learned senior  counsel and Mr. Hrishikesh Baruah, learned counsel appearing  for juvenile ‘X’.  6.    To appreciate the contentions of the parties, it would be  relevant to make a brief reference to the history and development  of Juvenile Justice Act in India. In India there was no pan India  Act to govern children, and some states had their own  enactments, like the Madras Children Act, 1920. The Union had  also enacted the Children Act of 1960 but this was only  applicable to Union Territories and not the States.              Therefore,  this Court in Sheela Barse(II) and others            vs. Union of India  and others1, observed as follows :­                 “4. We have by our order dated August 5, 1986 called           upon the State Governments to bring into force and to           implement vigorously the provisions of the Childrens’           Acts enacted in the various States. But we would suggest           that instead of each State having its own Childrens’ Act           different in procedure and content from the Childrens’           Act in other States, it would be desirable if the Central           Government initiates Parliamentary Legislation on the           subject, so that there is complete uniformity in regard to           the various provisions relating to children in the entire           territory of the country…”     1 (1986) 3 SCC 632                                                                            3 It would be pertinent to mention that these observations were  made in the context of developments happening internationally in  the field of Child Rights. The United Nations General Assembly  adopted the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the  Administration of Juvenile Justice on 29th November, 1985.  These Rules are commonly referred to as the Beijing Rules.  Clause 4.1 of the Rules reads as follows :­          “4.1     In those legal systems recognizing the concept of         the age of criminal responsibility for juveniles, the         beginning of that age shall not be fixed at too low an age         level, bearing in mind the facts of emotional, mental and         intellectual maturity.”   7.   As is apparent, the Rules did not fix any specified age and  left it to each country to frame their domestic laws, keeping in  view the various relevant doctrines.  8.   After the adoption of the Beijing Rules, India enacted the  Juvenile Justice Act, 1986. In this Act, the juvenile was defined  under Section 2(h) to mean a boy who has not attained the age of  16 years or a girl who has not attained the age of 18 years. Such  a juvenile was entitled to          various    protections and these  protections were uniform irrespective of the nature of the crime  committed.                                                                        4 9.    The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Child, (CRC  for short) was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly  on 20th November, 1989, and this Convention came into force on  2nd September, 1990.    Under Article 1 of the CRC a child was  defined as every human being below the age of 18 years.  However, if the domestic law provided that the child attained  majority below the age of 18 years, then that would be treated to  be the age till which the child would remain a juvenile. Discretion  was left to the individual countries to fix the age of juvenility  under the domestic laws.  10.   The next development was the enactment of The Juvenile  Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000 (hereinafter  referred to as the Act of 2000) which repealed the Juvenile  Justice Act, 1986. Under the Act of 2000 a juvenile or child was  defined to mean a person who had not completed 18 years of age.  Even a juvenile in conflict with law was defined to mean a  juvenile who was alleged to have committed an offence.       Since  there was no clarity with regard to the date on which the age was  to be determined, the definition of juvenile in conflict with law  was amended and the juvenile in conflict with law has been                                                                     5 defined to mean a juvenile who is alleged to have committed an  offence and has not completed 18th year of age as on the day of  commission of the offence.  11.   An unfortunate incident of rape and murder of a young girl  (given the identity ‘Nirbhaya’) took place in Delhi in December  2012. One of the persons involved in the crime was a juvenile,  aged 17½ years. This led to a call from society to re­visit the law  and some sections of society felt that the word ‘juvenile’ had been  given a very wide meaning and juveniles have been dealt with  leniently. In one such matter Salil Bali vs. Union of India and  Another2, this Court rejected the writ petition which prayed for  reconsideration of Sections 2(k), 2(l), and 15 of the Act of 2000.  Thereafter, a writ petition titled Subramanian Swamy and  others     vs.   Raju through Member, Juvenile Justice Board  and Another3 was filed challenging the provisions of the Act of  2000, especially with regard to classification of juveniles.   This  petition was also dismissed. This Court held that the decision as  to who should be treated as a juvenile is a decision for the  Legislature to take and the courts cannot enter into this arena.  2 (2013) 7 SCC 705 3 (2014) 8 SCC 390                                                                     6 12.   Thereafter, the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of  Children) Act, 2015 (hereinafter referred to the Act of 2015) was  enacted.   For the first time, the Act of 2015 made a departure  from the earlier Acts.     Since this Act is the subject matter of  discussion in this case, we may refer to the following relevant  provisions of the Act.          “Section 2(12) “child” means a person who has not         completed eighteen years of age;         Section 2(13) “child in conflict with law” means a child         who is alleged or found to have committed an offence and         who has not completed eighteen years of age on the date         of commission of such offence;            xxx                     xxx                    xxx         Section 2(33) “heinous offences” includes the offences for         which the minimum punishment under the Indian Penal         Code (45 of 1860) or any other law for the time being in         force is imprisonment for seven years or more;            xxx                   xxx                  xxx         Section 2(35) “juvenile” means a child below the age of         eighteen years;            xxx                  xxx                   xxx         Section 2(45) “petty offences” includes the offences for         which the maximum punishment under the Indian Penal         Code (45 of 1860) or any other law for the time being in         force is imprisonment upto three years;            xxx                  xxx                   xxx         Section 2(54) “serious offences” includes the offences for         which the punishment under the Indian Penal Code (45         of 1860) or any other law for the time being in force, is         imprisonment between three to seven years;”                                                                          7 13.   A bare reading of Section 2(12), 2(13) and 2(35) clearly  shows that a child or a juvenile is a person who has not  completed 18 years of age, and a child in conflict with law is a  child/juvenile who commits an offence when that child/juvenile  has not completed 18 years of age. ‘Petty offences’ have been  defined under Section 2(45) to mean offences for which the  maximum punishment provided under any law including the  IPC, is imprisonment up to 3 years. ‘Serious offences’ means,  offences for which punishment under any law is imprisonment  between 3­7 years.       ‘Heinous offences’ have been defined to  mean offences for which the minimum punishment under any  law is imprisonment for 7 years or more. This was a departure  from the previous legislation on the subject where the offences  had not been categorised as heinous or serious.  14.   Section 14 of the Act of 2015 lays down the procedure to be  followed by the Juvenile Justice Board while conducting an  enquiry regarding a child in conflict with law under these  different categories. We are mainly concerned with sub­section  (5) (d), (e) and (f), which reads as follows :­           “14. Inquiry by Board regarding child in conflict with          law.                                                                     8               xxx                   xxx                    xxx         (5) The Board shall take the following steps to ensure fair         and speedy inquiry, namely:—         (a)    …                    …                            …         (b)    …                    …                            …         (c)    …                    …                            …         (d) cases of petty offences, shall be disposed of by the         Board through summary proceedings, as per the         procedure prescribed under the Code of Criminal         Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974);         (e) inquiry of serious offences shall be disposed of by the         Board, by following the procedure, for trial in summons         cases under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of         1974);         (f) inquiry of heinous offences,—                 (i) for child below the age of sixteen years as on                 the date of commission of an offence shall be                 disposed of by the Board under clause (e);                 (ii) for child above the age of sixteen years as on                 the date of commission of an offence shall be                 dealt with in the manner prescribed under                 section 15.”   15.   The inquiry for serious offences has to be disposed of by  following the procedure for trial in summons cases under the  Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (Cr.PC for short). As far as  heinous offences are concerned if the child is below 16 years  then the procedure prescribed for serious offences is to be  followed; but if the child is above 16 years then assessment in  terms of Section 15 has to be made.                                                                           9 16.   The above categorisation has been done with a purpose  which is reflected in Section 15 of the Act of 2015, which reads  as follows :­           “15.    Preliminary assessment into heinous offences          by Board. ­ (1) In case of a heinous offence alleged to          have been committed by a child, who has completed or is          above the age of sixteen years, the Board shall conduct a          preliminary assessment with regard to his mental and          physical capacity to commit such offence, ability to          understand the consequences of the offence and the          circumstances in which he allegedly committed the          offence, and may pass an order in accordance with the          provisions of sub­section (3) of section 18:          Provided that for such an assessment, the Board may          take the assistance of experienced psychologists or          psycho­social workers or other experts.          Explanation.—For the purposes of this section, it is          clarified that preliminary assessment is not a trial, but is          to assess the capacity of such child to commit and          understand the consequences of the alleged offence.          (2) Where the Board is satisfied on preliminary          assessment that the matter should be disposed of by the          Board, then the Board shall follow the procedure, as far          as may be, for trial in summons case under the Code of          Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974):          Provided that the order of the Board to dispose of the          matter shall be appealable under sub­section (2) of          section 101.          Provided further that the assessment under this section          shall be completed within the period specified in section          14. This Section provides that if the child offender has committed a  heinous offence, the Juvenile Justice Board shall conduct a  preliminary assessment with regard to the mental and physical  capacity of such child to commit such offence, the ability of the                                                                           10 child to understand the consequence of the offence and the  circumstances in which the said offence was allegedly committed.  The   Board    is   entitled   to   take    the    help    of   experienced  psychologists, psychosocial workers or other experts in the field.  The explanation makes it clear that the preliminary assessment  is not to go into the merits of the trial or the allegations against  the child. The inquiry is conducted only to assess the capacity of  the child to commit and understand the consequence of the  offence. If the Board is satisfied that the matter can be disposed  of by the Board, then the Board shall follow the procedure  prescribed in summons cases under the Cr.PC.  17.   Section 19 of the Act of 2015 empowers the Children’s  Court to re­assess the preliminary assessment of the Board  under Section 15. It reads as follows :­          “19. Powers of Children’s Court ­ (1) After the receipt of         preliminary assessment from the Board under section 15,         the Children’s Court may decide that—         (i) there is a need for trial of the child as an adult as per         the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2         of 1974) and pass appropriate orders after trial subject to         the provisions of this section and section 21, considering         the special needs of the child, the tenets of fair trial and         maintaining a child friendly atmosphere;         (ii) there is no need for trial of the child as an adult and         may conduct an inquiry as a Board and pass appropriate         orders in accordance with the provisions of section 18.                                                                             11         (2) The Children’s Court shall ensure that the final order,         with regard to a child in conflict with law, shall include         an individual care plan for the rehabilitation of child,         including follow up by the probation officer or the District         Child Protection Unit or a social worker.         (3) The Children’s Court shall ensure that the child who         is found to be in conflict with law is sent to a place of         safety till he attains the age of twenty­one years and         thereafter, the person shall be transferred to a jail:         Provided that the reformative services including         educational services, skill development, alternative         therapy such as counselling, behaviour modification         therapy, and psychiatric support shall be provided to the         child during the period of his stay in the place of safety.         (4) The Children’s Court shall ensure that there is a         periodic follow up report every year by the probation         officer or the District Child Protection Unit or a social         worker, as required, to evaluate the progress of the child         in the place of safety and to ensure that there is no ill­         treatment to the child in any form.         (5) The reports under sub­section (4) shall be forwarded         to the Children’s Court for record and follow up, as may         be required.” 18.   The Children’s Court constituted under the Act of 2015 has  to determine whether there is actually any need for trial of the  child as an adult under the provisions of Cr.PC and pass  appropriate orders in this regard. The Children’s Court should  also take into consideration the special needs of the child, tenets  of fair trial and maintaining child­friendly atmosphere.               The  Court can also hold that there is no need to try the child as an  adult. Even if the Children’s Court holds that the child has to be  tried as an adult, it must ensure that the final order includes an  individual care plan for rehabilitation of the child as specified in                                                                          12 Sub­section (2) of Section 19. Furthermore, under Sub­section(3)  such a child must be kept in a place of safety and cannot be sent  to jail till the child attains the age of 21 years, even if such a  child has to be tried as an adult. It is also provided that though  the child may be tried as an adult, reformative services,  educational services, skill development, alternative therapy,  counselling, behaviour modification, and psychiatric support is  provided to the child during the period the child is kept in the  place of safety.  19.   It would also be pertinent to refer to Section 21 of the Act of  2015 which clearly lays down that no child in conflict with law  shall be sentenced to death or life imprisonment without the  possibility of release whether tried under the Act or under the  IPC, or any other law.  20.   It is contended by Mr. Siddharth Luthra, that if the  definitions of offences, i.e., petty, serious and heinous are read  literally then there is one category of offences which is not  covered by the Act of 2015. He submits that petty offences are  those offences where the punishment is up to 3 years, serious  offences are those where the maximum punishment is of 7 years,                                                                      13 and as far as heinous offences are concerned, if the definition is  read literally, then these are only those offences which provide a  minimum sentence of 7 years and above. He submits that this  leaves out a host of offences falling within the 4 th category. The 4th  category of offences are those where the minimum sentence is  less than 7 years, or there is no minimum sentence prescribed  but the maximum sentence is more than 7 years.                He has  submitted a chart of such offences. It is not necessary to set out  the chart in­extenso but we may highlight a few of these offences.  Some of these offences relate to abetment but they also include  offences such as those under Section 121A, 122 of IPC, offences  relating to counterfeiting of currency, homicide not amounting to  murder (as in the present case), abetment to suicide of child or  innocent person and many others. He submits that it could not  have been the intention of the Legislature to leave out these  offences and they should have been in some category at least.  The submission of Mr. Luthra is that if from the definition of  ‘heinous offences’, the word ‘minimum’ is removed then all  offences other than petty and serious would fall under the  heading of ‘heinous offences’. He submits that if the 4 th category  of offences is left out it would result in an absurdity which could                                                                      14 not have been the intention of the Legislature.         He further  submits that applying the doctrine of surplusage, if the word  ‘minimum’ is removed then everything will fall into place.  21.     On the other hand, Mr. Mukul Rohatgi, learned senior  counsel for the juvenile ‘X’ submitted that this Court cannot  rewrite the law.    He further submits that the intention of the  Legislature cannot be deciphered by this Court only on the  ground that a category of offences have been left out. If there is a  lacuna in the scheme of the Act it is for the Legislature to correct  the lacuna and this Court cannot step in.  22.     It is true that if we accept the submission of Mr. Luthra,  then things will fall into place. There would be only 3 categories  of offences and all offences punishable with imprisonment of 7  years and above would be classified as ‘heinous offence’.  However, we are not solving a jigsaw puzzle where we have to put  all the pieces in place. We are interpreting a statute which must  be interpreted as per its language and intent.  23.     The Golden Rule of Interpretation was laid down by the  House of Lords in Grey vs. Pearson4, as follows :­   4 (1857) 6 HLC 61                                                                    15             “...I have been long and deeply impressed with the             wisdom of the rule, now, I believe, universally adopted, at             least in the Courts of Law in Westminster Hall, that in             construing wills and indeed statutes, and all written             instruments, the grammatical and ordinary sense of the             words is to be adhered to, unless that would lead to some             absurdity, or some repugnance or inconsistency with the             rest of the instrument, in which case the grammatical             and ordinary sense of the words may be modified, so as             to avoid that absurdity and inconsistency, but no farther.             ...”   24.     The Privy Council in Salmon vs. Duncombe and Others5  stated the principle in the following terms :­              “It is, however, a very serious matter to hold that when             the main object of a statute is clear, it shall be reduced to             a nullity by the draftsman’s unskilfulness or ignorance of             law. It may be necessary for a Court of Justice to come             to such a conclusion, but their Lordships hold that             nothing can justify it except necessity or the absolute             intractability of the language used. ...”   25.     In Justice G.P. Singh’s treatise, “Principles of Statutory  Interpretation’6 the doctrine of surplusage as a limit on the  traditional rule of strict construction has been referred to. The  main judgment on this point is the decision of the House of Lords  in McMonagle vs. Westminster City Council7. In that case the  defendant’s premises contained a machine which on insertion of  a coin revealed two naked women in a manifestly immoral  manner. The defendant was charged with using this premises as 5 (1886) 11 AC 627 6 14th Edn., Lexis Nexis, pp.89­90, 983 (2016) 7 [1990] 2 A.C. 716                                                                              16 a sex establishment without any licence. His contention was that  the Act (Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1982)  used the words ‘which is not unlawful’ and since he was  conducting an unlawful activity he did not require a licence. It  was in this context that the House of Lords held that the words  ‘which are not unlawful’ should be treated as surplusage and as  having been introduced by incompetent draftsmanship. In that  case the intention of the Legislature was clear that no sex  establishment could be set up without a licence.                       The words  ‘which is not unlawful’ would render the entire provision  nugatory.       That does not happen in this case.                     What has  happened in this case is that there is a 4th category of offences  which is not dealt with under the Act.                 It cannot be said with  certainty that the Legislature intended to include this 4 th category  of offences in the category of ‘heinous offences’. Merely because  removing the word ‘minimum’ would make the Act workable is  not a sufficient ground to hold that the word ‘minimum’ is  surplusage.   26.   This Court in Vasant Ganpat Padave                            vs.     Anant  Mahadev Sawant8 was dealing with the provisions of Section 32­  8 2019 SCC Online SC 1226 ( Judgment dated 18.09.2018 Civil Appeal No. 11774 of 2018)                                                                                    17 F(1)(a) of the Maharashtra Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act,  1948. It was an admitted case of the parties that this was a law  for agrarian reforms. The provision in issue deals with the rights  of the tenant to purchase the property where the landlord is a  widow, minor or person with mental or physical disability. This  Section essentially gave a right to the tenant to exercise his right  of purchase within one year from the expiry of the period during  which such landlord is entitled to terminate the tenancy.       The  Section literally provided that the landlord shall send an  intimation to the tenant of the fact that he has attained majority  before the expiry of the period during which the landlord is  entitled to terminate the tenancy under Section 31.      Though a  widow or a disabled person were not required to give notice for  the tenant to exercise his right of purchase, in the case of a  minor unless the minor on attaining majority issued such a  notice, the tenant would not be able to exercise his right of  purchase. Effectively the minor on attaining majority cold defeat  the right of the tenant by not issuing the notice.     It is in this  context that this Court held that this would create such an  anomaly that it would turn the entire scheme of agrarian reform  on its head. Therefore, it held as follows :­                                                                    18         “25. … This anomaly indeed turns the entire scheme of         agrarian reform on its head. We have thus to see         whether the language of Section 32­F can be added to or         subtracted from, in order that the absurdity         aforementioned and the discrimination between persons         who are similarly situate be obviated.”   After discussing various rules of interpretation the Court held  that instead of striking out the classification as a whole it would  delete the words ‘of the fact that he has attained majority’. We  may refer to para 43 which is relevant :­           “43.     Given the fact that the object of the 1956         Amendment, which is an agrarian reform legislation, and         is to give the tiller of the soil statutory title to land which         such tiller cultivates; and, given the fact that the literal         interpretation of Section 32­F(1)(a) would be contrary to         justice and reason and would lead to great hardship qua         persons who are similarly circumstanced; as also to the         absurdity of land going back to an absentee landlord         when he has lost the right of personal cultivation, in the         teeth of the object of the 1956 Amendment as mentioned         hereinabove, we delete the words “..of the fact that he has         attained majority..”. Without these words, therefore, the         landlord belonging to all three categories has to send an         intimation to the tenant, before the expiry of the period         during which such landlord is entitled to terminate the         tenancy under Section 31.”  27.   Mr. Luthra, drew our attention to the speech of the Minister  while introducing the Bill in relation to the Act of 2015. We need  not repeat the speech in detail but reading of the same clearly  indicates that the Minister while dealing with the issue of  ‘heinous offences’ wherein the children could be tried as adults                                                                             19 mainly made reference to the offences of murder, rape and  terrorism.   There are some other speeches that have been  referred to by Mr. Luthra, but we are not referring to the same  because the intention of the Legislature as a whole cannot be  gauged from the speeches of individual members, some of whom  supported the Bill and some of whom did not support the Bill.  The main reliance could only be made on the objects and reasons  and introduction of the Bill by the Minister which basically  makes reference to offences like murder, rape, terrorism, where  the minimum punishment is more than 7 years.  28.   There can be no quarrel with the submission made by Mr.  Siddharth Luthra that in a given circumstance, this Court can  even add or subtract words from a statute. However, this can be  done only when the intention of the Legislature is clear. We not  only have to look at the principles of statutory interpretation but  in the present case, the conundrum we face is that how do we  decipher the intention of the Legislature. It is not necessary that  the intention of the Legislature is the one what the judge feels it  should be. If the intention of the Legislature is clear then the  Court can get over the inartistic or clumsy wording of the statute.                                                                     20 However, when the wording of the statute is clear but the  intention of the Legislature is unclear, the Court cannot add or  subtract words from the statute to give it a meaning which the  Court feels would fit into the scheme of things.  29.   There can be no manner of doubt that if the intention of the  Legislature is absolutely clear from the objects and reasons of the  Act then the Court can correct errors made by the person who  drafted the legislation and may write down or omit/delete/add  words to serve the purpose of the legislation and ensure that the  legislation is given a meaning which was intended to by the  Legislature.   The issue is whether in the present case we can  clearly hold what was the intention of the Legislature.  30.   We must also while interpre"

These civil appeals emanate from the common judgment and    order dated 8.8.2018 passed by the High Court of Punjab and Signature Not Verified  Digitally signed by DEEPAK SINGH Date: 2020.01.13 16:16:23 IST    Haryana at Chandigarh (for short, ‘the High Court’) in cross appeals Reason:       being F.A.O. Nos. 1341 of 2016 (O&M) and 4023 of 2016 (O&M),                                       2  questioning the correctness of the award dated 4.12.2015 passed by  the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal, Jind (for short, ‘the Tribunal’) in  M.A.C.T. Case No. 205 of 2014.        The former appeal (arising out of  S.L.P.(C) No……/2020 @ Diary No. 47693/2018) has been preferred  by the insurance company and the latter appeal (arising out of S.L.P.  (C) No……./2020 @ Diary No. 17683/2019) by the claimants­  respondent Nos. 1 and 2.        The parties are referred to as per their  status in the former appeal for the sake of convenience.   4.   The claim petition was filed by the respondent Nos. 1 and 2  herein, who are the major sons of Smt. Sunheri Devi (deceased). The  deceased was on her way to attend the office of Tehsildar, Uchana  (where she was working as a Peon) from Dharoli Khera village on  20.10.2014 at about 9.00 a.m., travelling as a pillion rider on a  motorcycle bearing No. HR­32­G­8749. At that time, a dumper/tipper  bearing registration No. HR­56­A­3260 coming from the opposite  direction, being driven in a rash and negligent manner, collided with  the motorcycle, resulting in fatal injuries sustained to the deceased to  which she succumbed.   5.   The   respondent    Nos.     1   and   2   claimed   an   amount   of  Rs.50,00,000/­ (Rupees fifty lakhs only) along with interest at the rate  of 12% per annum on the assertion that the deceased was earning                                    3  Rs.28000/­ per month (Rs.21000/­ as salary and Rs.7000/­ as family  pension of her husband), she was hale and healthy and was the only  bread earner of her entire family and that they were largely dependant  upon her income and have also been deprived of her love and  affection.   The appellant disputed the claim and pleaded that the  accident did not occur with the offending vehicle (the dumper/tipper)  or due to fault of its driver, and that the respondent Nos. 1 and 2  were majors and not dependant upon the deceased and as such not  entitled for any compensation. Further, the vehicle in question was  being plied in contravention of terms and conditions of the insurance  policy and the driver was not holding a valid and effective driving  licence. Resultantly, the insurance company­appellant was not liable  to pay compensation.   6.   After analysing the evidence on record, the Tribunal held that  the accident of the deceased occurred due to rash and negligent  driving of the offending vehicle. The Tribunal further noted that the  driver and the owner of offending vehicle have placed on record the  driving licence of the driver, valid insurance policy, public carrier  permit and the registration certificate of the offending vehicle and the  appellant having failed to lead any evidence to prove that the terms  and conditions of the insurance policy were violated, cannot be                                     4  absolved of its liability. The Tribunal also noted that though the  respondent Nos. 1 and 2 were major and earning hands, the fact that  they were legal heirs of the deceased and have been deprived of the  pecuniary benefits through the deceased cannot be denied.   7.   Having decided the above issues in favour of the respondent  Nos. 1 and 2, the Tribunal while determining the quantum of  compensation took note of the gross monthly salary of the deceased  as on September, 2014, which according to her service record was  Rs.23,123/­ and the net take home salary was Rs.16,918/­.        The  Tribunal did not consider the family pension for computation, as the  deceased was getting it in her own right as widow and the same could  not be reckoned. Her date of birth was 1.4.1967 and date due for  retirement was 31.3.2027, for which multiplier of ‘13’ was applied.  The deduction towards personal expenses was kept at 50% as the  respondent Nos. 1 and 2 were major and earning hands. Thus, the  loss of dependency was determined at Rs. 17,15,532/­. In addition,  an amount of Rs.25,000/­ was awarded on account of funeral  expenses, etc. and the total compensation was computed at  Rs.17,40,532/­ along with interest at the rate of 9% per annum from  the date of institution of petition. The driver, owner and insurer of  the offending vehicle were held jointly and severally liable.                                   5  8.   Against the award passed by the Tribunal, cross appeals were  preferred being F.A.O. No. 1341 of 2016 (O&M) filed by the appellant  and F.A.O. No. 4023 of 2016 (O&M) filed by the respondent Nos. 1  and 2. The appellant (insurance company) primarily contended that  the respondent Nos. 1 and 2 are not entitled to compensation for loss  of dependency as they are major and earning and also because the  family of the deceased was entitled to receive financial assistance  under the Haryana Compassionate Assistance to the Dependants of  Deceased Government Employees Rules, 2006 (in short, ‘the 2006  Rules’). The respondent Nos. 1 and 2 contended that being major and  also earning by itself cannot be regarded as ineligibility to claim  compensation.   Further, the Tribunal has wrongly assessed loss of  dependency on take­home salary instead of the drawing salary and  without considering the family pension received by the deceased had  she been alive. They further claimed that the deduction of personal  expenses should be one­third (1/3rd) instead of 50%.   9.   The High Court by considering the monthly salary for computing  compensation as Rs.23,123/­, benefits of future prospects at 30%,  applying a multiplier of ‘13’ and deduction for personal expenses at  50% held that the respondent Nos. 1 and 2 were entitled to loss of  dependency qua loss of income at Rs.23,44,672/­. The High Court,                                          6  in addition, while considering the loss of dependency qua loss of  pension by taking monthly pension at Rs.7,000/­, applying a  multiplier of ‘13’ and deduction for personal expenses at 50%, held  that Rs.5,46,000/­ would be payable towards this head.               The  compensation under conventional heads was also increased from  Rs.25,000/­ to Rs.30,000/­.             Therefore, the total compensation  payable was determined as Rs.29,20,672/­. The High Court further  noted that financial assistance available to the family of the deceased,  under the 2006 Rules would be Rs.33,29,712/­ and deducted 50% of  the said amount from compensation whilst relying upon a judgment  of the same High Court in New India Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Ajmero  and others1.          The High Court then deducted that amount of  Rs.16,64,856/­ from the compensation amount of Rs.29,20,672/­  determined by it.            Resultantly, the High Court reduced the  compensation awarded by the Tribunal to the extent of Rs.4,84,716/­  and gave liberty to the appellant to recover the excess amount, if  already paid.   10.   The former appeal is preferred by the appellant on the ground  that the High Court ought to have deducted the entire amount of  financial assistance under the 2006 Rules, instead of deducting only   1 F.A.O.   No. 2648 of 2016, decided on 31.07.2017                                     7  50% thereof. Reliance was placed on the judgment of this Court in  Reliance General Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Shashi Sharma and Ors.2.  It is urged that claim for loss of dependency is unavailable to the  respondent Nos. 1 and 2 in the facts of the present case, they being  major sons of the deceased who were married and also gainfully  employed.       Reliance is placed on Manjuri Bera (Smt) v. Oriental  Insurance Co. Ltd. & Anr.3. It is urged that the respondent Nos. 1  & 2 may be entitled only to compensation under conventional heads  as held in National Insurance Company Limited v. Pranay Sethi  & Ors.4.   11.   The latter appeal has been preferred by the respondent Nos. 1  and 2, primarily on the ground that the High Court erred in deducting  50% of the amount from compensation instead of one­third (1/3 rd).  Further, deduction of 50% amount of the financial assistance  receivable under the 2006 Rules on the assumption that the  respondent Nos. 1 and 2 are eligible therefor is a manifest error.  Reliance is also placed on the decision of the High Court in Ajmero  (supra). It is urged that the High Court ought to have considered that  the respondent Nos. 1 and 2 were dependant on the deceased and  2 (2016)   9 SCC 627 3 (2007)   10 SCC 643 4 (2017)   16 SCC 680                                        8  that they have been deprived of her love and affection and income and  thus entitled to compensation as claimed in the original application in  that regard.   12.     We have heard Mr. Amit Kumar Singh, learned counsel for the  insurance company (appellant) and Ms. Abha R. Sharma, learned  counsel for the respondent Nos. 1 and 2. The principal issues which  arise for our consideration are as follows: ­   (i)     Whether the major sons of the deceased who are married and          gainfully employed or earning, can claim compensation under          the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (for short, ‘the Act’)?   (ii)    Whether    such   legal   representatives   are   entitled   only   for          compensation under the conventional heads?   (iii)   Whether the amount receivable by the legal representatives of          the deceased under the 2006 Rules is required to be deducted as          a whole or only portion thereof?   13.     Reverting to the first issue ­ that needs to be answered on the  basis of the scheme of the Act. Section 166 of the Act provides for  filing of application for compensation by persons mentioned in  clauses (a) to (d) of sub­Section (1) thereof. Section 166 of the Act, as  applicable at the relevant time, reads thus: ­                                          9              “Section 166.      Application for compensation.­ (1) An             application for compensation arising out of an accident of             the nature specified in sub­section (1) of section 165 may be             made­                   (a)   by the person who has sustained the injury; or                   (b)   by the owner of the property; or                   (c)   where death has resulted from the accident, by                         all or any of the legal representatives of the                         deceased; or                   (d)   by any agent duly authorised by the person                         injured or all or any of the legal representatives                         of the deceased, as the case may be:                    Provided that where all the legal representatives of the             deceased have not joined in any such application for             compensation, the application shall be made on behalf of or             for the benefit of all the legal representatives of the deceased             and the legal representatives who have not so joined, shall             be impleaded as respondents to the application.             (2)   Every application under sub­section (1) shall be made,             at the option of the claimant, either to the Claims Tribunal             having jurisdiction over the area in which the accident             occurred or to the Claims Tribunal within the local limits of             whose jurisdiction the claimant resides or carries on             business or within the local limits of whose jurisdiction the             defendant resides, and shall be in such form and contain             such particulars as may be prescribed:                    Provided that where no claim for compensation under             Section 140 is made in such application, the application             shall contain a separate statement to that effect immediately             before the signature of the applicant.             (3)   ***             (4)   The Claims Tribunal shall treat any report of accidents             forwarded to it under sub­section (6) of section 158 as an             application for compensation under this Act.”                                                        (emphasis supplied)  14.   The legal representatives of the deceased could move application  for compensation by virtue of clause (c) of Section 166(1). The major  married son who is also earning and not fully dependant on the  deceased,     would     be    still   covered    by    the    expression       “legal                                        10  representative” of the deceased. This Court in Manjuri Bera (supra)  had expounded that liability to pay compensation under the Act does  not cease because of absence of dependency of the concerned legal  representative. Notably, the expression “legal representative” has not  been defined in the Act. In Manjuri Bera (supra), the Court observed  thus:­             “9.    In terms of clause (c) of sub­section (1) of Section 166           of the Act in case of death, all or any of the legal           representatives of the deceased become entitled to           compensation and any such legal representative can file a           claim petition. The proviso to said sub­section makes the           position clear that where all the legal representatives had not           joined, then application can be made on behalf of the legal           representatives of the deceased by impleading those legal           representatives as respondents. Therefore, the High Court           was justified in its view that the appellant could maintain a           claim petition in terms of Section 166 of the Act.            10. …..The Tribunal has a duty to make an award,           determine the amount of compensation which is just and           proper and specify the person or persons to whom such           compensation would be paid. The latter part relates to the           entitlement of compensation by a person who claims for the           same.            11. According to Section 2(11) CPC, “legal representative”           means a person who in law represents the estate of a de­           ceased person, and includes any person who intermeddles           with the estate of the deceased and where a party sues or is           sued in a representative character the person on whom the           estate devolves on the death of the party so suing or sued.           Almost in similar terms is the definition of legal representa­           tive under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 i.e. un­           der Section 2(1)(g).            12. As observed by this Court in Custodian of Branches of           BANCO National Ultramarino v. Nalini Bai Naique [1989 Supp           (2) SCC 275 the definition contained in Section 2(11) CPC is           inclusive in character and its scope is wide, it is not confined           to legal heirs only. Instead it stipulates that a person who                                      11            may or may not be legal heir competent to inherit the prop­           erty of the deceased can represent the estate of the deceased           person. It includes heirs as well as persons who represent           the estate even without title either as executors or adminis­           trators in possession of the estate of the deceased. All such           persons would be covered by the expression “legal represen­           tative”. As observed in Gujarat SRTC v. Ramanbhai Prabhatb­           hai [(1987) 3 SCC 234 a legal representative is one who suf­           fers on account of death of a person due to a motor vehicle           accident and need not necessarily be a wife, husband, par­           ent and child.”  In paragraph 15 of the said decision, while adverting to the provisions  of Section 140 of the Act, the Court observed that even if there is no  loss of dependency, the claimant, if he was a legal representative, will  be entitled to compensation. In the concurring judgment of Justice  S.H. Kapadia, as His Lordship then was, it is observed that there is  distinction between “right to apply for compensation” and “entitlement  to compensation”. The compensation constitutes part of the estate of  the deceased.   As a result, the legal representative of the deceased  would inherit the estate. Indeed, in that case, the Court was dealing  with the case of a married daughter of the deceased and the efficacy  of Section 140 of the Act. Nevertheless, the principle underlying the  exposition in this decision would clearly come to the aid of the  respondent Nos. 1 and 2 (claimants) even though they are major sons  of the deceased and also earning.   15.   It is thus settled by now that the legal representatives of the  deceased have a right to apply for compensation. Having said that, it                                         12  must necessarily follow that even the major married and earning sons  of the deceased being legal representatives have a right to apply for  compensation and it would be the bounden duty of the Tribunal to  consider the application irrespective of the fact whether the concerned  legal representative was fully dependant on the deceased and not to  limit the claim towards conventional heads only.             The evidence on  record in the present case would suggest that the claimants were  working as agricultural labourers on contract basis and were earning  meagre income between Rs.1,00,000/­ and Rs.1,50,000/­ per annum.  In that sense, they were largely dependant on the earning of their  mother and in fact, were staying with her, who met with an accident  at the young age of 48 years.   16.   The next issue is about the deduction of the amount receivable  by the legal representatives of the deceased under the 2006 Rules  from the compensation amount determined by the Tribunal in terms  of the decision of three­Judge Bench of this Court in Shashi Sharma  (supra).     This Court, after analysing the relevant rules, opined as  follows: ­                “23. Reverting back to Rule 5, sub­rule (1) provides for the              period during which the dependants of the deceased              employee may receive financial assistance equivalent to the              pay and other allowances that was last drawn by the              deceased employee in the normal course without raising a                             13  specific claim. Sub­rule (2) provides that the family shall be eligible to receive family pension as per the normal Rules only after the period during which they would receive the financial assistance in terms of sub­rule (1). Sub­rule (3) guarantees the family of a deceased government employee of a government residence in occupation for a period of one year from the date of death of the employee, upon payment of normal rent/licence fee. By virtue of sub­ rule (4), an ex gratia assistance of Rs 25,000 is provided to the family of the deceased employee to meet the immediate needs on the loss of the bread earner. Sub­rule (5) clarifies that house rent allowance shall not be a part of allowance for the purposes of calculation of assistance.  24. …..As regards the second part, it deals with income from other source which any way is receivable by the dependants of the deceased government employee. That cannot be deducted from the claim amount for determination of a just compensation under the 1988 Act.  25. The claimants are legitimately entitled to claim for the loss of “pay and wages” of the deceased government employee against the tortfeasor or insurance company, as the case may be, covered by the first part of Rule 5 under the 1988 Act. The claimants or dependants of the deceased government employee (employed by the State of Haryana), however, cannot set up a claim for the same subject falling under the first part of Rule 5—“pay and allowances”, which are receivable by them from employer (the State) under Rule 5(1) of the 2006 Rules. In that, if the deceased employee was to survive the motor accident injury, he would have remained in employment and earned his regular pay and allowances. Any other interpretation of the said Rules would inevitably result in double payment towards the same head of loss of “pay and wages” of the deceased government employee entailing in grant of bonanza, largesse or source of profit to the dependants/claimants…..  26. Indeed, similar statutory exclusion of claim receivable under the 2006 Rules is absent. That, however, does not mean that the Claims Tribunal should remain oblivious to the fact that the claim towards loss of pay and wages of the deceased has already been or will be compensated by the employer in the form of ex gratia financial assistance on compassionate grounds under Rule 5(1). The Claims Tri­ bunal has to adjudicate the claim and determine the amount of compensation which appears to it to be just. The amount receivable by the dependants/claimants towards the head of                                        14            “pay and allowances” in the form of ex gratia financial assis­           tance, therefore, cannot be paid for the second time to the           claimants. True it is, that the 2006 Rules would come into           play if the government employee dies in harness even due to           natural death. At the same time, the 2006 Rules do not ex­           pressly enable the dependants of the deceased government           employee to claim similar amount from the tortfeasor or in­           surance company because of the accidental death of the de­           ceased government employee. The harmonious approach for           determining a just compensation payable under the 1988           Act, therefore, is to exclude the amount received or receiv­           able by the dependants of the deceased government em­           ployee under the 2006 Rules towards the head financial as­           sistance equivalent to “pay and other allowances” that was           last drawn by the deceased government employee in the nor­           mal course. This is not to say that the amount or payment           receivable by the dependants of the deceased government           employee under Rule 5(1) of the Rules, is the total entitle­           ment under the head of “loss of income”. So far as the claim           towards loss of future escalation of income and other bene­           fits is concerned, if the deceased government employee had           survived the accident can still be pursued by them in their           claim under the 1988 Act. For, it is not covered by the 2006           Rules. Similarly, other benefits extended to the dependants           of the deceased government employee in terms of sub­rule           (2) to sub­rule (5) of Rule 5 including family pension, life in­           surance, provident fund, etc., that must remain unaffected           and cannot be allowed to be deducted, which, any way would           be paid to the dependants of the deceased government em­           ployee, applying the principle expounded in Helen C. Re­           bello v. Maharashtra SRTC, (1999) 1 SCC 90 and United In­           dia Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Patricia Jean Mahajan, (2002) 6           SCC 281 cases.            27. A priori, the appellants must succeed only to the ex­           tent of amount receivable by the dependants of the deceased           government employee in terms of Rule 5(1) of the 2006           Rules, towards financial assistance equivalent to the loss of           pay and wages of the deceased employee for the period speci­           fied.”                                                   (emphasis supplied)   The learned Judge of the High Court has, however, after adverting to  the decision of the same High Court in Ajmero (supra), went on to  observe   that   50%     of   the    amount      receivable     by    the    legal                                        15  representatives of the deceased towards financial assistance under  the 2006 Rules is required to be deducted from the compensation  amount.    In the relied upon decision, the same learned Judge had  occasion to observe as follows: ­              “… However, perusal of the judgment would reveal that            the Court has not adverted to the issue that had the            Rules of 2006 extending assistance to family of a            deceased employee been not in existence, family would            have been entitled to pension to the extent of 50% of            the last drawn pay. As per the settled position in law, the            pensionary benefits available to family of a deceased            employee are not amenable for deduction for computing loss            of dependency. There is nothing on record suggestive of the            fact that in addition to compassionate assistance under the            Rules, family of the deceased is being paid pension till the            age of superannuation. Rather Rule 5(2) of the 2006 Rules            specifically denies family pension as per normal rules...”                                                       (emphasis supplied)   17.   The view so taken by the High Court is not the correct reading of  the decision of three­Judge Bench of this Court in Shashi Sharma  (supra) for more than one reason. First, this Court was conscious of  the fact that under Rule 5(2) of the 2006 Rules, the family pension  receivable by the family would be payable, however, only after the  period,   during   which    the    financial   assistance     is   received,   is  completed. In that context, in paragraph 24 of the reported decision,  the Court clearly noted that the amount towards family pension  cannot be deducted from the claim amount for determination of a just  compensation under the Act.                 Further, the High Court has                                     16  erroneously assumed that the family of the deceased would be  entitled for family pension amount immediately after the death of the  deceased employee. That is in the teeth of the scheme of the 2006  Rules, in particular Rule 5(2) thereof.     The said Rules provide for  financial assistance on compassionate grounds, as also, other  benefits to the family members of the deceased employee and as a  package thereof, Rule 5(2) stipulates that the family pension as per  the normal rules would be payable to the family members only after  the period of delivery of financial assistance is completed.          The  validity of this provision is not put in issue. Suffice it to say that the  view taken by the High Court in Ajmero (supra) is a departure from  the scheme envisaged by the 2006 Rules, in particular, Rule 5(2).  That cannot be countenanced.   18.   As a matter of fact, in the present case, the High Court  committed manifest error in assuming that the respondent Nos. 1 and  2 would be eligible to receive financial assistance under the 2006  Rules.   The eligibility to receive such financial assistance has been  spelt out in Rule 3 of the 2006 Rules read with the provision of  Pension/Family Pension Scheme, 1964. It appears that major sons  and married daughters are not included in the definition. However,  we need not dilate on that aspect in the present proceedings any                                    17  further. It has come in the evidence of Gobind Singh, Clerk in SDM  Office (PW­1) that the legal representatives of the deceased have not  submitted any request for getting financial assistance till he had  deposed. Indeed, respondent No. 1, who had entered the witness box,  did depose that they had applied for getting salary of their deceased  mother. The fact remains that there is no clear evidence on record  that respondent Nos. 1 and 2 are held to be eligible to get financial  assistance or in fact, they are getting such financial assistance under  the 2006 Rules. The High Court, therefore, instead of providing for  deduction of the amount receivable by the legal representatives of the  deceased   on   this   count   (under   the   2006   Rules),   from   the  compensation amount, should have independently determined the  compensation amount and ordered payment thereof subject to legal  representatives of the deceased filing affidavit/declaration before the  executing Court that they have not received nor would they claim any  amount towards financial assistance under the 2006 Rules, so as to  become entitled to withdraw the entire compensation amount.   19.   Reverting to the determination of compensation amount, it is  noticed that the Tribunal proceeded to determine the compensation  amount on the basis of net­salary drawn by the deceased for the  relevant period as Rs.16,918/­ per month, while taking note of the                                          18  fact that her gross­salary was Rs.23,123/­ per month (presumably  below taxable income).           Concededly, any deduction from the gross­  salary other than tax amount cannot be reckoned. In that, the actual  salary less tax amount ought to have been taken into consideration  by the Tribunal for determining the compensation amount, in light of  the dictum of the Constitution Bench of this Court in paragraph 59.3  of Pranay Sethi (supra).   20.   Similarly, the High Court despite having taken note of the  submission made by the respondent Nos. 1 and 2 that the deduction  for personal expenses of the deceased should be reckoned only as  one­third (1/3rd) amount for determining loss of dependency,  maintained the deduction of 50% towards that head as ordered by the  Tribunal.       This Court in Pranay Sethi (supra), in paragraph 37,  adverted to the dictum of this Court in Sarla Verma (Smt.) & Ors.  vs. Delhi Transport Corporation & Anr.5 with approval, wherein it  is held that if the dependant family members are 2 to 3, as in this  case, the deduction towards personal and living expenses of the  deceased should be taken as one­third (1/3rd). In other words, the  deduction towards personal expenses to the extent of 50% is  excessive and not just and proper considering the fact that the  5 (2009)   6 SCC 121 (para 30)                                      19  respondent Nos. 1 and 2 alongwith their respective families were  staying with the deceased at the relevant time and were largely  dependant on her income.   21.   Be that as it may, the Tribunal, for excluding the amount  received by the deceased as family pension due to demise of her  husband, had noted in paragraph 26, as under: ­            “26. Learned counsel for the claimants further requested           that about to family pension being drawn by the deceased           also be calculated "

RAVINDRA BHAT, J.  1.        The appellant questions a decision of the High Court of Delhi 1. On 18.05.2012, the appellant was injured in a motor accident while travelling to Hapur as a passenger in a bus, having paid the requisite fare. At about 1.30 pm when the bus reached village Sadikpur, PS-Hafizpur, Hapur, Uttar Pradesh, the driver of the offending bus (the first respondent) sought to overtake the bus in which the appellant was travelling, from the wrong side, and zipped the appellant’s bus, scratching it. This rash and negligent act caused a dent in the bus where the appellant was seated, as a result of which he suffered injuries. The appellant was removed to Dr. Khan’s Rehan hospital and thereafter, AIIMS Trauma Center. The appellant claimed compensation, impleading the owner, the driver of the vehicle, and the insurer. During the course of proceedings before the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, he applied for ascertainment of his disability. The disability report (Ex. PW-l/9 dated 01.04.2014 issued by Pandit   1     dated 13.09.2018, in M.A.C. APP. 520/ 2016                                         2   Madan Mohan Malviya Hospital, during the motor vehicles compensation claim proceedings) showed that he suffered 89% disability in relation to his right upper limb, which had to be amputated. The report also went on to say that the condition was “non progressive, not likely to improve. Reassessment is not recommended”. A first information report (FIR) regarding the accident was registered (FIR No. 57/12), as case Crime No. 255/12, Hazifpur Police Station, Hapur, Uttar Pradesh, under Sections 279 and 338 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860.  2.      The appellant, at that time unmarried, was working as a data entry operator/typist at Tis Hazari Courts. Prior to the injury, he earned an amount of ? 12,000 per month. He had applied for grant of compensation under Sections 166 and 140 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, (hereafter “the Act”) claiming a sum of ? 50 lakhs with interest at the rate of 12% per annum against the first respondent, (the driver of the bus at the time of the accident), the second respondent (owner of the vehicle), and third respondent (the insurer). The Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (hereafter the “Tribunal”) rejected the insurer’s objection regarding its jurisdiction and further held that the appellant had suffered serious injuries due to rash and negligent driving of the respondent. It awarded compensation in the following terms:          1.   Compensation for medical expenses          11,000          2.   Compensation for pain and suffering        30,000          3.   Compensation for special diet, attendant 30,000               and conveyance charges          4.   Loss of future earning capacity/ income    11,66,400          5.   Loss of amenities and enjoyment of life    15,000                                            3             6.    Compensation for disfigurement            25,000            7.    Loss of income during treatment           48,000            8.    Future medical expenses                   1,00,000            9.    TOTAL                                     14,25,400     3.        While assessing loss of earning capacity, the Tribunal took the appellant’s income to be ? 8000 per month, and added 50% towards future prospects. At the time of the accident, the appellant was only 20 years of age. Therefore, a multiplier of 18 was applied. The physical disability was assessed to be 45%, by the Tribunal. The High Court, to which the claimant appealed (and the insurer cross appealed), revised this head of compensation by doing away with the addition of 50% towards future prospects, and reassessed the compensation for loss of earning capacity as ? 7,77,600 (?8000 x 12 x 45% x 18). The total compensation was reassessed by the High Court to be ?14,36,600, after enhancing the compensation for disfigurement, diet, attendant and conveyance, loss of amenities and enjoyment of life, and pain and suffering. Further, an interest of 9% per annum was imposed. In reducing the amount awarded for loss of future prospects, the High Court noticed this court’s judgments in National Insurance Company Ltd. v. Pranay Sethi & Ors.2 and Jagdish v. Mohan & Ors3 both by three-judge benches of this court.    4.        The appellant argues that the impugned judgment is in material error, in misreading this court’s judgments in Pranay Sethi & Ors4 which was later  2     (2017) 16 SCC 860. 3     (2018) 4 SCC 571 4     Supra n.2                                            4   followed in Jagdish5 by a three judge Bench, which had ruled that the benefit of future prospects should not be confined only to those who have a permanent job and would extend to self-employed individuals, and in case of self- employed persons an addition of 40% of established income should be made where the age of the victim at the time of the accident was below 40 years. It was urged that the decision in Anant s/o of Sidheshwar Dukre v. Pratap s/o Zhamnnappa Lamzane & Anr.6 relied on by the High Court, did not assess future prospects. However, that per se did not preclude claims by persons incurring permanent disablement as a consequence of motor accidents, from seeking such heads of compensation. It is urged that the High Court misread and created a distinct category of cases where addition in income towards ""future prospects"" can only be given in case of death, and not for injury, which cannot be the intention of this court as no such observation is made. It was argued that the High Court should have reassessed and not reduced 'the loss of future earning capacity' of the appellant from ? 11,66,400/- (determined by the tribunal) to ? 7,77,600/- on the wrongly depressed income of ? 8000/-. Learned counsel submitted that the assessment of monthly income should have been Rs.12,000/- and not Rs.8,000/. It was submitted that the courts below ignored the fact that in 2012, persons earning Rs.12, 000/- per month did not have to file income tax returns or pay tax. The High Court further erred in assessment of physical permanent disability of injured as 45%, even though it was 100%.    5.        Counsel for the insurer, who contested the appeal, urged this court not to interfere with the impugned judgment, and stated that the assessment of compensation was made by the High Court in conformity with this Court’s decisions. It was highlighted that permanent disability of loss of one arm,  5     Supra n.3 6     2018 (9) SCC 450                                                         5   cannot lead to loss of earning capacity of up to 90% and consequently, the assessment of compensation on the head of loss of earning capacity was correctly fixed at 45%. He also argued that as far as income is concerned, although the appellant relied on the independent testimony of a lawyer (who stated that he used to pay him about ? 300/- per day), there was no proof of payment of income tax to support the claim that the appellant earned ? 12,000/- per month. The production of the PAN card ipso facto did not establish income at the level claimed. Further, the counsel urged that the impugned judgment correctly appreciated the law, and loss of alleged future earning capacity was turned down.  6.       The principle consistently followed by this court in assessing motor vehicle compensation claims, is to place the victim in as near a position as she or he was in before the accident, with other compensatory directions for loss of amenities and other payments. These general principles have been stated and reiterated in several decisions.7  7.       Two questions arise for consideration: one, whether in cases of permanent disablement incurred as a result of a motor accident, the claimant can seek, apart from compensation for future loss of income, amounts for future        7         Govind Yadav v. New India Insurance Co. Ltd. [Govind Yadav v. New India Insurance Co. Ltd., (2011)      10 SCC 683. This court referred to the pronouncements in R.D. Hattangadi v. Pest Control (India) (P) Ltd.,      (1995) 1 SCC 551; Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences v. Prasanth S. Dhananka (2009) 6 SCC      1; Reshma Kumari v. Madan Mohan (2009) 13 SCC 422; Raj Kumar v. Ajay Kumar, (2011) 1 SCC 343.      Govind Yadav spelt out these principles by stating that the courts should,           “in determining the quantum of compensation payable to the victims of accident, who are      disabled either permanently or temporarily. If the victim of the accident suffers permanent      disability, then efforts should always be made to award adequate compensation not only for the      physical injury and treatment, but also for the loss of earning and his inability to lead a normal      life and enjoy amenities, which he would have enjoyed but for the disability caused due to the      accident.”   These decisions were also followed in ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Ajay Kumar Mohanty, (2018) 3 SCC 686.                                          6   prospects too; and two, the extent of disability. On the first question, the High Court no doubt, is technically correct in holding that Pranay Sethi8 involved assessment of compensation in a case where the victim died. However, it went wrong in saying that later, the three-judge bench decision in Jagdish9 was not binding, but rather that the subsequent decision in Anant10 to the extent that it did not award compensation for future prospects, was binding. This court is of the opinion that there was no justification for the High Court to have read the previous rulings of this court, to exclude the possibility of compensation for future prospects in accident cases involving serious injuries resulting in permanent disablement. Such a narrow reading of Pranay Sethi11 is illogical, because it denies altogether the possibility of the living victim progressing further in life in accident cases - and admits such possibility of future prospects, in case of the victim’s death.  8.        This court has emphasized time and again that “just compensation” should include all elements that would go to place the victim in as near a position as she or he was in, before the occurrence of the accident. Whilst no amount of money or other material compensation can erase the trauma, pain and suffering that a victim undergoes after a serious accident, (or replace the loss of a loved one), monetary compensation is the manner known to law, whereby society assures some measure of restitution to those who survive, and the victims who have to face their lives. In Santosh Devi v. National Insurance Company Limited12, this Court held that:    8      Supra n.2 9      Supra n.3 10      Supra n.6 11      Supra n.2 12      (2012) 6 SCC 421                                  7   “14. We find it extremely difficult to fathom any rationale for the observation made in paragraph 24 of the judgment in Sarla Verma's case that where the deceased was self-employed or was on a fixed salary without provision for annual increment, etc., the Courts will usually take only the actual income at the time of death and a departure from this rule should be made only in rare and exceptional cases involving special circumstances. In our view, it will be nave to say that the wages or total emoluments/income of a person who is self-employed or who is employed on a fixed salary without provision for annual increment, etc., would remain the same throughout his life.   15. The rise in the cost of living affects everyone across the board. It does not make any distinction between rich and poor. As a matter of fact, the effect of rise in prices which directly impacts the cost of living is minimal on the rich and maximum on those who are self-employed or who get fixed income/emoluments. They are the worst affected people. Therefore, they put extra efforts to generate additional income necessary for sustaining their families.   16. The salaries of those employed under the Central and State Governments and their agencies/instrumentalities have been revised from time to time to provide a cushion against the rising prices and provisions have been made for providing security to the families of the deceased employees. The salaries of those employed in private sectors have also increased manifold. Till about two decades ago, nobody could have imagined that salary of Class IV employee of the Government would be in five figures and total emoluments of those in higher echelons of service will cross the figure of rupees one lac.   17. Although, the wages/income of those employed in unorganized sectors has not registered a corresponding increase and has not kept pace with the increase in the salaries of the Government employees and those employed in private sectors but it cannot be denied that there has been incremental enhancement in the income of those who are self-employed and even those engaged on daily basis, monthly basis or even seasonal basis. We can take judicial notice of the fact that with a view to meet the challenges posed by high cost of living, the persons falling in the                                            8             latter category periodically increase the cost of their labour. In           this context, it may be useful to give an example of a tailor who           earns his livelihood by stitching cloths. If the cost of living           increases and the prices of essentials go up, it is but natural for           him to increase the cost of his labour. So will be the cases of           ordinary skilled and unskilled labour, like, barber, blacksmith,           cobbler, mason etc.             18. Therefore, we do not think that while making the           observations in the last three lines of paragraph 24 of Sarla           Verma's judgment, the Court had intended to lay down an           absolute rule that there will be no addition in the income of a           person who is self-employed or who is paid fixed wages. Rather,           it would be reasonable to say that a person who is self-employed           or is engaged on fixed wages will also get 30 per cent increase in           his total income over a period of time and if he / she becomes           victim of accident then the same formula deserves to be applied           for calculating the amount of compensation.”   9.        In Jagdish13 the victim, a carpenter, suffered permanent disablement, and his claim for compensation including for loss of future prospects was considered by a three-judge bench (which included, incidentally, the judges who had decided Pranay Sethi14). This court held that:             “13. In the judgment of the Constitution Bench in Pranay           Sethi [National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Pranay Sethi, (2017) 16           SCC 680], this Court has held that the benefit of future prospects           should not be confined only to those who have a permanent job           and would extend to self-employed individuals. In the case of a           self-employed person, an addition of 40% of the established           income should be made where the age of the victim at the time of           the accident was below 40 years. Hence, in the present case, the           appellant would be entitled to an enhancement of Rs 2400           towards loss of future prospects.    13      Supra.n.3 14      Supra n.2                                    9   14. In making the computation in the present case, the court must be mindful of the fact that the appellant has suffered a serious disability in which he has suffered a loss of the use of both his hands. For a person engaged in manual activities, it requires no stretch of imagination to understand that a loss of hands is a complete deprivation of the ability to earn. Nothing—at least in the facts of this case—can restore lost hands. But the measure of compensation must reflect a genuine attempt of the law to restore the dignity of the being. Our yardsticks of compensation should not be so abysmal as to lead one to question whether our law values human life. If it does, as it must, it must provide a realistic recompense for the pain of loss and the trauma of suffering. Awards of compensation are not law's doles. In a discourse of rights, they constitute entitlements under law. Our conversations about law must shift from a paternalistic subordination of the individual to an assertion of enforceable rights as intrinsic to human dignity.  15. The Tribunal has noted that the appellant is unable to even eat or to attend to a visit to the toilet without the assistance of an attendant. In this background, it would be a denial of justice to compute the disability at 90%. The disability is indeed total. Having regard to the age of the appellant, the Tribunal applied a multiplier of 18. In the circumstances, the compensation payable to the appellant on account of the loss of income, including future prospects, would be Rs 18, 14,400. In addition to this amount, the appellant should be granted an amount of Rs 2 lakhs on account of pain, suffering and loss of amenities. The amount awarded by the Tribunal towards medical expenses (Rs 98,908); for extra nourishment (Rs 25,000) and for attendant's expenses (Rs 1 lakh) is maintained. The Tribunal has declined to award any amount towards future treatment. The appellant should be allowed an amount of Rs 3 lakhs towards future medical expenses. The appellant is thus awarded a total sum of Rs 25,38,308 by way of compensation. The appellant would be entitled to interest at the rate of 9% p.a. on the compensation from the date of the filing of the claim petition. The liability to pay compensation has been fastened by the Tribunal and by the High Court on the insurer, owner and driver jointly and severally which is affirmed. The amount shall be deposited before the Tribunal within a period of 6 weeks from today and shall be paid over to the appellant upon proper identification.”                                                           10   10.        The recent decision in Parminder Singh v. New India Assurance Co. Ltd15, involved an accident victim who underwent surgery for hemiplegia16. According to the treating medic, he could not work as a labourer or perform any agricultural work, or work as a driver (as he was wont to); the assessment of his disability was at 75%, and of a permanent nature. The court held that:             “5.2. On the basis of the affidavit filed by the employer of the            appellant, we accept that the income of the appellant was Rs            10,000 p.m. at the time of the accident, for the purpose of            computing the compensation payable to him.             5.1. The appellant has however, produced an affidavit by his            employer in this Court. As per the said affidavit, the appellant            was earning Rs 10,000 p.m. at the time of the accident.             5.3. Taking the income of the appellant as Rs 10,000 p.m., with            future prospects @ 50% as awarded by the High Court, the total            income of the appellant would come to Rs 15,000 p.m.             5.4. The appellant was 23 years old at the time when the accident            occurred. Applying the multiplier of 18, the loss of future            earnings suffered by the appellant would work out to Rs 15,000            × 12 × 18 = Rs 32,40,000.                       *********                   *********                   **********             5.7. In K. Suresh v. New India Assurance Co. Ltd (2012) 12 SCC            274, this Court held that17:                      “10. It is noteworthy to state that an adjudicating                     authority, while determining the quantum of                     compensation, has to keep in view the sufferings of the                     injured person which would include his inability to lead a                     full life, his incapacity to enjoy the normal amenities                     which he would have enjoyed but for the injuries and his                     ability to earn as much as he used to earn or could have  15      (2019) 7 SCC 217 16      Weakness of one half of the body on the left side; in this case, caused by an accident. 17      at page 279, para 10                                             11                     earned. Hence, while computing compensation the                   approach of the Tribunal or a court has to be broad-                   based. Needless to say, it would involve some guesswork                   as there cannot be any mathematical exactitude or a                   precise formula to determine the quantum of                   compensation. In determination of compensation the                   fundamental criterion of “just compensation” should be                   inhered.”            ********                    *********                       ********            5.9.

In such circumstances, the High           Court has rightly assessed the appellant's functional disability at           100% insofar as his loss of earning capacity is concerned. The           appellant is, therefore, awarded Rs 32,40,000 towards loss of           earning capacity.”   11.       Yet later and more recently in an accident case, which tragically left in its wake a young girl in a life-long state of paraplegia, this court, in Kajal v. Jagdish Chand,18 reiterated that in addition to loss of earnings, compensation for future prospects too could be factored in, and observed that:       “14. In Concord of India Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Nirmala Devi [Concord       of India Insurance Co. Ltd. v.

Broadly speaking while fixing the amount of   compensation payable to a victim of an accident, the   damages have to be assessed separately as pecuniary   damages and special damages. Pecuniary damages are those   which the victim has actually incurred and which are capable   of being calculated in terms of money; whereas non-   pecuniary damages are those which are incapable of being   assessed by arithmetical calculations. In order to appreciate   two concepts pecuniary damages may include expenses   incurred by the claimant: (i) medical attendance; (ii) loss of   earning of profit up to the date of trial; (iii) other material   loss. So far as non-pecuniary damages are concerned, they   may include : (i) damages for mental and physical shock,   pain and suffering, already suffered or likely to be suffered in   the future; (ii) damages to compensate for the loss of   amenities of life which may include a variety of matters i.e.   on account of injury the claimant may not be able to walk,   run or sit; (iii) damages for loss of expectation of life i.e. on   account of injury the normal longevity of the person   concerned is shortened; (iv) inconvenience, hardship,   discomfort, disappointment, frustration and mental stress in   life.”   16.

Ajay Kumar, (2011) 1 SCC 343 : (2011) 1 SCC (Civ) 164 : (2011) 1 SCC (Cri) 1161] , this Court laid down the heads under which compensation is to be awarded for personal injuries : (SCC p. 348, para 6)   “6. The heads under which compensation is awarded in  personal injury cases are the following:   Pecuniary damages (Special damages)  (i) Expenses relating to treatment, hospitalisation, medicines,  transportation, nourishing food, and miscellaneous  expenditure.  (ii) Loss of earnings (and other gains) which the injured would  have made had he not been injured, comprising:  (a) Loss of earning during the period of treatment;  (b) Loss of future earnings on account of permanent disability.  (iii) Future medical expenses.  Non-pecuniary damages (General damages)                                     13    (iv) Damages for pain, suffering and trauma as a consequence  of the injuries.  (v) Loss of amenities (and/or loss of prospects of marriage).  (vi) Loss of expectation of life (shortening of normal  longevity).  In routine personal injury cases, compensation will be  awarded only under heads (i), (ii)(a) and (iv). It is only in  serious cases of injury, where there is specific medical  evidence corroborating the evidence of the claimant, that  compensation will be granted under any of the heads (ii)(b),  (iii), (v) and (vi) relating to loss of future earnings on account  of permanent disability, future medical expenses, loss of  amenities (and/or loss of prospects of marriage) and loss of  expectation of life.”   17.

The quintessentiality lies in the    pragmatic computation of the loss sustained which has to be in the    realm of realistic approximation. Therefore, Section 168 of the    Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (for brevity “the Act”) stipulates that    there should be grant of “just compensation”. Thus, it becomes a    challenge for a court of law to determine “just compensation”    which is neither a bonanza nor a windfall, and simultaneously,    should not be a pittance.”                 *******                   ********             *********  Loss of earnings   20. Both the courts below have held that since the girl was a young  child of 12 years only notional income of Rs 15,000 p.a. can be taken  into consideration. We do not think this is a proper way of assessing  the future loss of income. This young girl after studying could have  worked and would have earned much more than Rs 15,000 p.a. Each  case has to be decided on its own evidence but taking notional  income to be Rs 15,000 p.a. is not at all justified. The appellant has  placed before us material to show that the minimum wages payable                                         14         to a skilled workman is Rs 4846 per month. In our opinion, this       would be the minimum amount which she would have earned on       becoming a major. Adding 40% for the future prospects, it works to       be Rs 6784.40 per month i.e. 81,412.80 p.a. Applying the multiplier       of 18, it works out to Rs 14,65,430.40, which is rounded off to Rs       14,66,000.”   12.    In view of the above decisive rulings of this court, the High Court clearly erred in holding that compensation for loss of future prospects could not be awarded. In addition to loss of future earnings (based on a determination of the income at the time of accident), the appellant is also entitled to compensation for loss of future prospects, @ 40% (following the Pranay Sethi principle). 13.    The factual narrative discloses that the appellant, a 20-year-old data entry operator (who had studied up to 12th standard) incurred permanent disability, i.e. loss of his right hand (which was amputated). The disability was assessed to be 89%. However, the tribunal and the High Court re-assessed the disability to be only 45%, on the assumption that the assessment for compensation was to be on a different basis, as the injury entailed loss of only one arm. This approach, in the opinion of this court, is completely mechanical and entirely ignores realities. Whilst it is true that assessment of injury of one limb or to one part may not entail permanent injury to the whole body, the inquiry which the court has to conduct is the resultant loss which the injury entails to the earning or income generating capacity of the claimant. Thus, loss of one leg to someone carrying on a vocation such as driving or something that entails walking or constant mobility, results in severe income generating impairment or its extinguishment altogether. Likewise, for one involved in a job like a carpenter or hairdresser, or machinist, and an experienced one at that, loss of an arm, (more so a functional arm) leads to near extinction of income generation. If the age of the victim is beyond 40, the scope of rehabilitation too diminishes. These individual factors are of crucial importance which are to be borne in mind while determining the                                            15   extent of permanent disablement, for the purpose of assessment of loss of earning capacity. 14.       In Neerupam Mohan Mathur v. New India Assurance Company19, this court considered the case of a victim, whose injury was assessed to 70% as loss of earning capacity for amputation of the arm; he was a postgraduate diploma holder in mechanical engineering, 32 years of age and earning about ? 3000/- per month. This court held, approving the High Court’s order (which had adopted the formula from the Workmen’s Compensation Act, to determine 70% for the purpose of deciding loss of earning capacity) as follows:           “12. In the present case, the percentage of permanent disability           has not been expressed by the doctors with reference to the full           body or with reference to a particular limb. However, it is not in           dispute that the claimant suffered such a permanent disability as           a result of injuries that he is not in a position of doing the           specialised job of designing, refrigeration and air conditioning.           For the said reason, the claimant's services were terminated by           his employer but that does not mean that the claimant is not           capable to do any other job including the desk job. Having           qualification of BSc degree and postgraduate diploma in           Mechanical Engineering, he can perform any job where           application of mind is required than any physical work.            13. In view of the forgoing discussion we find no grounds made           out to interfere with the finding of the High Court which           determined the percentage of loss of earning capacity to 70%           adopting the percentage of loss of earning capacity as per the           Workmen's Compensation Act. The total loss of income was thus           rightly calculated by the High Court at Rs 6, 04,800.”  15.       Later, in another judgment, i.e. Jakir Hussein v. Sabir20 this court had to consider the correctness of a compensation assessment based on the High Court’s analysis of the injury to the victim (a driver who suffered permanent injury to his arm, impairing movement as well as the wrist, which rendered him  19      (2013) 14 SCC 15 20      (2015) 7 SCC 252                                        16   incapable of driving any vehicle). The High Court had assessed permanent disablement at 30% though the doctor had certified it to be 55%. This court, reversing the High Court order, observed i"

These Civil Appeals have been referred to a Bench of three               honourable Judges of this Court by a Division Bench reference order dated Signature Not Verified   SUSHMA KUMARI BAJAJ              26.07.2019, dealing with the interpretation of Section 65B of the Indian Digitally signed by  Date: 2020.07.14 16:56:15 IST Reason:                                                                                         1      Evidence Act, 1872 (“Evidence Act”) by two judgments of this Court. In the       reference order, after quoting from Anvar P.V. v. P.K. Basheer & Ors.       (2014) 10 SCC 473 (a three Judge Bench decision of this Court), it was       found that a Division Bench judgment in SLP (Crl.) No. 9431 of 2011       reported as Shafhi Mohammad v. State of Himachal Pradesh (2018) 2       SCC 801 may need reconsideration by a Bench of a larger strength.  3.                 The brief facts necessary to appreciate the controversy in the       present case, as elucidated in Civil Appeals 20825-20826 of 2017, are as       follows:       i.            Two election petitions were filed by the present Respondents            before the Bombay High Court under Sections 80 and 81 of the            Representation of the People Act, 1951, challenging the election of the            present Appellant, namely, Shri Arjun Panditrao Khotkar (who is the            Returned Candidate [hereinafter referred to as the “RC”] belonging to            the Shiv Sena party from 101-Jalna Legislative Assembly Constituency)            to the Maharashtra State Legislative Assembly for the term commencing            November, 2014. Election Petition No.6 of 2014 was filed by the            defeated Congress (I) candidate Shri Kailash Kishanrao Gorantyal,            whereas Election Petition No.9 of 2014 was filed by one Shri Vijay                                                                                  2        Chaudhary, an elector in the said constituency. The margin of victory for         the RC was extremely narrow, namely 296 votes - the RC having         secured 45,078 votes, whereas Shri Kailash Kishanrao Gorantyal         secured 44,782 votes.  ii.             The entirety of the case before the High Court had revolved         around four sets of nomination papers that had been filed by the RC. It         was the case of the present Respondents that each set of nomination         papers suffered from defects of a substantial nature and that, therefore,         all four sets of nomination papers, having been improperly accepted by         the Returning Officer of the Election Commission, one Smt. Mutha,         (hereinafter referred to as the “RO”), the election of the RC be declared         void. In particular, it was the contention of the present Respondents that         the late presentation of Nomination Form Nos. 43 and 44 by the RC -         inasmuch as they were filed by the RC after the stipulated time of 3.00         p.m. on 27.09.2014 - rendered such nomination forms not being filed in         accordance with the law, and ought to have been rejected.  iii.            In order to buttress this submission, the Respondents sought         to rely upon video-camera arrangements that were made both inside         and outside the office of the RO. According to the Respondents, the                                                                                  3        nomination papers were only offered at 3.53 p.m. (i.e. beyond 3.00         p.m.), as a result of which it was clear that they had been filed out of         time. A specific complaint making this objection was submitted by Shri         Kailash Kishanrao Gorantyal before the RO on 28.09.2014 at 11.00         a.m., in which it was requested that the RO reject the nomination forms         that had been improperly accepted. This request was rejected by the         RO on the same day, stating that the nomination forms had, in fact,         been filed within time.  4.               Given the fact that allegations and counter allegations were       made as to the time at which the nomination forms were given to the RO,       and that videography was available, the High Court, by its order dated       16.03.2016, ordered the Election Commission and the concerned officers       to produce the entire record of the election of this Constituency, including       the original video recordings. A specific order was made that this electronic       record needs to be produced along with the ‘necessary certificates’.  5.               In compliance with this order, such video recordings were       produced by the Election Commission, together with a certificate issued       with regard to the CDs/VCDs, which read as follows:                                          “Certificate                                                                                  4              This is to certify that the CDs in respect of video recording              done on two days of filing nomination forms of date              26.9.2014 and 27.9.2014 which were present in the record              are produced.

Issue nos.6 and 7 as       framed by the High Court (and its answers to these issues) are important,       and are set out in the impugned judgment dated 24.11.2017, and extracted       hereinbelow:             “Issues                             Findings            6.

In answering issues 6 and 7, the High Court recorded:         “60. Many applications were given by the petitioner of        Election Petition No. 6/2014 to get the copies of electronic        record in respect of aforesaid incidents with certificate as        provided in section 65-B of the Evidence Act. The        correspondence made with them show that even after        leaving of the office by Smt. Mutha, the Government        machinery, incharge of the record, intentionally avoided to        give certificate as mentioned in section 65-B of the        Evidence Act. After production of the record in the Court in        this regard, this Court had allowed to Election Commission        by order to give copies of such record to applicants, but        after that also the authority avoided to give copies by        giving lame excuses. It needs to be kept in mind that the        RC is from political party which has alliance with ruling        party, BJP, not only in the State, but also at the center. It is        unfortunate that the machinery which is expected to be fair        did not act fairly in the present matter. The circumstances        of the present matter show that the aforesaid two officers        tried to cover up their mischief. However the material gives        only one inference that nomination forms Nos. 43 and 44        with A, B forms were presented before the RO by RC after        3.00 p.m. of 27.9.2014 and they were not handed over        prior to 3.00 p.m. In view of objection of the learned        counsels of the RC to using the information contained in        aforesaid VCDs, marked as Article A1 to A6, this Court        had made order on 11.7.2017 that the objections will be        considered in the judgment itself. This VCDs are already                                                                            6              exhibited by this Court as Exhs. 70 to 75. Thus, if the              contents of the aforesaid VCDs can be used in the              evidence, then the petitioners are bound to succeed in the              present matters.” 8.               The High Court then set out Sections 65-A and 65-B of the       Evidence Act, and referred to this Court’s judgment in Anvar P.V. (supra).       The Court held in paragraph 65 of the impugned judgment that the CDs       that were produced by the Election Commission could not be treated as an       original record and would, therefore, have to be proved by means of       secondary evidence. Finding that no written certificate as is required by       Section 65-B(4) of the Evidence Act was furnished by any of the election       officials, and more particularly, the RO, the High Court then held:               “69. In substantive evidence, in the cross examination of              Smt. Mutha, it is brought on the record that there was no              complaint with regard to working of video cameras used              by the office. She has admitted that the video cameras              were regularly used in the office for recording the              aforesaid incidents and daily VCDs were collected of the              recording by her office. This record was created as the              record of the activities of the Election Commission. It is              brought on the record that on the first floor of the building,              arrangement was made by keeping electronic gazettes              like VCR players etc. and arrangement was made for              viewing the recording. It is already observed that under              her instructions, the VCDs were marked of this recording.              Thus, on the basis of her substantive evidence, it can be              said that the conditions mentioned in section 65-B of the              Evidence Act are fulfilled and she is certifying the              electronic record as required by section 65-B (4) of the                                                                                 7              Evidence Act. It can be said that Election Commission, the              machinery avoided to give certificate in writing as required              by section 65-B (4) of the Evidence Act. But, substantive              evidence is brought on record of competent officer in that              regard. When the certificate expected is required to be              issued on the basis of best of knowledge and belief, there              is evidence on oath about it of Smt. Mutha. Thus, there is              something more than the contents of certificate mentioned              in section 65-B (4) of the Evidence Act in the present              matters. Such evidence is not barred by the provisions of              section 65-B of the Evidence Act as that evidence is only              on certification made by the responsible official position              like RO. She was incharge of the management of the              relevant activities and so her evidence can be used and              needs to be used as the compliance of the provision of              section 65-B of the Evidence Act. This Court holds that              there is compliance of the provision of section 65-B of the              Evidence Act in the present matter in respect of aforesaid              electronic record and so, the information contained in the              record can be used in the evidence.”       Based, therefore, on “substantial compliance” of the requirement of giving       a certificate under Section 65B of the Evidence Act, it was held that the       CDs/VCDs were admissible in evidence, and based upon this evidence it       was found that, as a matter of fact, the nomination forms by the RC had       been improperly accepted. The election of the RC was therefore was       declared void in the impugned judgment.  9.              Shri Ravindra Adsure, learned advocate appearing on behalf of       the Appellant, submitted that the judgment in Anvar P.V. (supra) covered       the case before us. He argued that without the necessary certificate in                                                                               8 writing and signed under Section 65B(4) of the Evidence Act, the  CDs/VCDs upon which the entirety of the judgment rested could not have  been admitted in evidence. He referred to Tomaso Bruno and Anr. v.  State of Uttar Pradesh (2015) 7 SCC 178, and argued that the said  judgment did not notice either Section 65B or Anvar P.V. (supra), and was  therefore per incuriam. He also argued that Shafhi Mohammad (supra),  being a two-Judge Bench of this Court, could not have arrived at a finding  contrary to Anvar P.V. (supra), which was the judgment of three Hon’ble  Judges of this Court. In particular, he argued that it could not have been  held in Shafhi Mohammad (supra) that whenever the interest of justice  required, the requirement of a certificate could be done away with under  Section 65B(4). Equally, this Court’s judgment dated 03.04.2018, reported  as (2018) 5 SCC 311, which merely followed the law laid down in Shafhi  Mohammad (supra), being contrary to the larger bench judgment in Anvar  P.V. (supra), should also be held as not having laid down good law. He  further argued that the Madras High Court judgment in K. Ramajyam v.  Inspector of Police (2016) Crl. LJ 1542, being contrary to Anvar P.V.  (supra), also does not lay down the law correctly, in that it holds that  evidence aliunde, that is outside Section 65B, can be taken in order to                                                                            9   make electronic records admissible. In the facts of the present case, he    contended that since it was clear that the requisite certificate had not been    issued, no theory of “substantial compliance” with the provisions of Section    65B(4), as was held by the impugned judgment, could possibly be    sustained in law.  10.           Ms. Meenakshi Arora, learned Senior Advocate appearing on    behalf of the Respondents, has taken us in copious detail through the facts    of this case, and has argued that the High Court has directed the Election    Commission to produce before the Court the original CDs/VCDs of the    video-recording done at the office of the RO, along with the necessary    certificate. An application dated 16.08.2016 was also made to the District    Election Commission and RO as well as the Assistant RO for the requisite    certificate under Section 65B. A reply was given on 14.09.2016, that this    certificate could not be furnished since the matter was sub-judice. Despite    this, later on, on 26.07.2017 her client wrote to the authorities again    requesting for issuance of certificate under Section 65B, but by replies    dated 31.07.2017 and 02.08.2017, no such certificate was forthcoming.    Finally, after having run from pillar to post, her client applied on 26.08.2017    to the Chief Election Commissioner, New Delhi, stating that the authorities                                                                                  10 were refusing to give her client the necessary certificate under Section 65B  and that the Chief Election Commissioner should therefore ensure that it  be given to them. To this communication, no reply was forthcoming from  the Chief Election Commissioner, New Delhi. Given this, the High Court at  several places had observed in the course of the impugned judgment that  the authorities deliberately refused, despite being directed, to supply the  requisite certificate under Section 65B, as a result of which the impugned  judgment correctly relied upon the oral testimony of the RO herself.  According to Ms. Arora, such oral testimony taken down in the form of  writing, which witness statement is signed by the RO, would itself amount  to the requisite certificate being issued under Section 65B(4) in the facts of  this case, as was correctly held by the High Court. Quite apart from this,  Ms. Arora also stated that - independent of the finding given by the High  Court by relying upon CDs/VCDs - the High Court also relied upon other  documentary and oral evidence to arrive at the finding that the RC had not  handed over nomination forms directly to the RO at 2.20 p.m (i.e. before  3pm). In fact, it was found on the basis of this evidence that the nomination  forms were handed over and accepted by the RO only after 3.00 p.m. and                                                                                11   were therefore improperly accepted, as a result of which, the election of    the Appellant was correctly set aside.  11.            On law, Ms. Arora argued that it must not be forgotten that    Section 65B is a procedural provision, and it cannot be the law that even    where a certificate is impossible to get, the absence of such certificate    should result in the denial of crucial evidence which would point at the truth    or falsehood of a given set of facts. She, therefore, supported the decision    in Shafhi Mohammad (supra), stating that Anvar P.V. (supra) could be    considered to be good law only in situations where it was possible for the    party to produce the requisite certificate. In cases where this becomes    difficult or impossible, the interest of justice would require that a procedural    provision be not exalted to such a level that vital evidence would be shut    out, resulting in manifest injustice.  12.            Shri Vikas Upadhyay, appearing on behalf of the Intervenor,    took us through the various provisions of the Information Technology Act,    2000 along with Section 65B of the Evidence Act, and argued that Section    65B does not refer to the stage at which the certificate under Section    65B(4) ought to be furnished. He relied upon a judgment of the High Court    of Rajasthan as well as the High Court of Bombay, in addition to Kundan                                                                                   12   Singh v. State 2015 SCC OnLine Del 13647 of the Delhi High Court, to    argue that the requisite certificate need not necessarily be given at the time    of tendering of evidence but could be at a subsequent stage of the    proceedings, as in cases where the requisite certificate is not forthcoming    due to no fault of the party who tried to produce it, but who had to apply to    a Judge for its production. He also argued that Anvar P.V. (supra) required    to be clarified to the extent that Sections 65A and 65B being a complete    code as to admissibility of electronic records, the “baggage” of Primary and    Secondary Evidence contained in Sections 62 and 65 of the Evidence Act    should not at all be adverted to, and that the drill of Section 65A and 65B    alone be followed when it comes to admissibility of information contained in    electronic records.  13.           It is now necessary to set out the relevant provisions of the    Evidence Act and the Information Technology Act, 2000. Section 3 of the    Evidence Act defines “document” as follows:            “Document.-- ""Document"" means any matter expressed           or described upon any substance by means of letters,           figures or marks, or by more than one of those means,           intended to be used, or which may be used, for the           purpose of recording that matter.”    “Evidence” in Section 3 is defined as follows:                                                                                 13              “Evidence.""-- ""Evidence"" means and includes—(1) all              statements which the Court permits or requires to be              made before it by witnesses, in relation to matters of fact              under inquiry;               such statements are called oral evidence;               (2) all documents including electronic records produced for              the inspection of the Court; such documents are called              documentary evidence.”    The Evidence Act also declares that the expressions “Certifying    Authority”, “electronic    signature”, “Electronic     Signature   Certificate”,    “electronic form”, “electronic records”, “information”, “secure electronic    record”, “secure digital signature” and “subscriber” shall have the meanings    respectively assigned to them in the Information Technology Act.  14.             Section 22-A of the Evidence Act, which deals with the    relevance of oral admissions as to contents of electronic records, reads as    follows:               “22A. When oral admission as to contents of              electronic records are relevant. -- Oral admissions as to              the contents of electronic records are not relevant, unless              the genuineness of the electronic record produced is in              question.”  15.             Section 45A of the Evidence Act, on the opinion of the    Examiner of Electronic Evidence, then states:                                                                                    14       “45A. Opinion of Examiner of Electronic Evidence.--       When in a proceeding, the court has to form an opinion on       any matter relating to any information transmitted or stored       in any computer resource or any other electronic or digital       form, the opinion of the Examiner of Electronic Evidence       referred to in section 79A of the Information Technology       Act, 2000 (21 of 2000), is a relevant fact.        Explanation.-- For the purposes of this section, an       Examiner of Electronic Evidence shall be an expert.”  16.      Sections 65-A and 65-B of the Evidence Act read as follows:        “65A. Special provisions as to evidence relating to       electronic record.--The contents of electronic records       may be proved in accordance with the provisions of       section 65B.”        “65B.

(5) For the purposes of this section,  (a) information shall be taken to be supplied to a computer if it is supplied thereto in any appropriate form and                                                                    17           whether it is so supplied directly or (with or without human           intervention) by means of any appropriate equipment; --            (b) whether in the course of activities carried on by any           official, information is supplied with a view to its being           stored or processed for the purposes of those activities by           a computer operated otherwise than in the course of those           activities, that information, if duly supplied to that           computer, shall be taken to be supplied to it in the course           of those activities;            (c) a computer output shall be taken to have been           produced by a computer whether it was produced by it           directly or (with or without human intervention) by means           of any appropriate equipment.

The following definitions as contained in Section 2 of the    Information Technology Act, 2000 are also relevant:            “(i) “computer” means any electronic, magnetic, optical or           other high-speed data processing device or system which           performs logical, arithmetic, and memory functions by           manipulations of electronic, magnetic or optical impulses,           and includes all input, output, processing, storage,           computer software or communication facilities which are           connected or related to the computer in a computer           system or computer network;”            “(j) “computer network” means the inter-connection of one           or more computers or computer systems or           communication device through– (i) the use of satellite,                                                                            18           microwave, terrestrial line, wire, wireless or other           communication media; and (ii) terminals or a complex           consisting of two or more interconnected computers or           communication device whether or not the inter-connection           is continuously maintained;”            “(l) “computer system” means a device or collection of           devices, including input and output support devices and           excluding calculators which are not programmable and           capable of being used in conjunction with external files,           which contain computer programmes, electronic           instructions, input data and output data, that performs           logic,    arithmetic,  data   storage    and   retrieval,           communication control and other functions;”            “(o) “data” means a representation of information,           knowledge, facts, concepts or instructions which are being           prepared or have been prepared in a formalised manner,           and is intended to be processed, is being processed or           has been processed in a computer system or computer           network, and may be in any form (including computer           printouts magnetic or optical storage media, punched           cards, punched tapes) or stored internally in the memory           of the computer;”            “(r) “electronic form”, with reference to information, means           any information generated, sent, received or stored in           media, magnetic, optical, computer memory, micro film,           computer generated micro fiche or similar device;”            “(t) “electronic record” means data, record or data           generated, image or sound stored, received or sent in an           electronic form or micro film or computer generated micro           fiche;”  18.

Pyarelal, Pawan Verma S/o Banshilal, Uma                    Verma w/o Pyarelal and their Nepali Domestic help Raju                    from past 6 months are not allowing the applicant to                    work on her fields. All the above persons used to abuse                    the applicant her husband and other family members                    and use to give death threats and use Caste coloured                    abuses. On 10.12.2019 at around 10 am, all these                    persons entered illegally in to four walls of her building                    and started hurling abuses on myself and my labourers                    and     gave    death    threats   and     used    castes’                    remarks/abuses and took away the construction                    material such as Cement, Iron, Rod, Bricks.            The                    Applicant is a Scheduled Caste and all of the above                    person uses castes’ remarks/abuses (used bad                    language) and said that you are persons of bad caste                    and that we will not let you live in this mohalla/vicinity.                    Respect Sir, the applicant and her family has threat to                    her life from such persons. Thus, it is requested that an                    FIR may be lodged against such persons and necessary                    action may be taken against them…..”     3.     Pursuant to the FIR filed by Respondent No. 2, Police filed a report         disclosing offences under Sections 504, 506 IPC and Section 3(1)(x)         of the Act, cognizance for the same was taken by the Trial Court on         25.6.2020. It is the said order which was challenged along with the         charge-sheet before the High Court, which was unsuccessful.  4.     On the other hand, on the basis of the statement of Mr. Pawan         Verma, an FIR No. 174 at about 23:47 hours was lodged on  2    For short, “the Act”.                                                                                   2        11.12.2019 in respect of an occurrence which had taken place         allegedly at 9:45 hours on 11.12.2019. A charge-sheet in the said         matter has been submitted against respondent No. 2 and others.         Thereafter, the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Pithoragarh had         taken cognizance for the offences under Sections 323 and 354 IPC         against respondent No. 2 and others on 2.7.2020.  5.     The Appellant invoked the jurisdiction of the High Court by way of a         petition under Section 482 of the Code to challenge the charge-         sheet and the order taking cognizance. The Appellant relied upon         Gerige Pentaiah v. State of Andhra Pradesh & Ors. 3 wherein         the allegation was of abusing the complainant in the name of their         caste and this Court quashed the complaint. The attention of the         High Court was drawn to another judgment reported as Ashabai         Machindra Adhagale v. State of Maharashtra & Ors. 4 wherein         this Court refused to quash the FIR on the ground that the caste of         the accused was not mentioned in the first information report. The         High Court found that both the abovementioned cases dealt with         the same issue with regard to applicability of the provisions of the         Act. It was observed by the High Court that the appellant had         categorically admitted that the informant belonged to Scheduled         Caste and that she and her labourers were abused. Therefore, the         provisions of the Act were found to be applicable and accordingly,         after investigation, charge-sheet has been submitted.       The High         Court dismissed the petition with the aforesaid findings.   3    (2008) 12 SCC 531 4    (2009) 3 SCC 789                                                                            3 6.   The learned counsel for the appellant argued that the disputes       relating to the property are pending before the Civil Court and that,       the present FIR has been filed on patently false grounds by       respondent No. 2 only to harass the appellant and to abuse of       process of law. It is argued that the allegations levelled in the FIR       and   the   subsequent   report   submitted   by   the   Police   after       investigations does not disclose any offence under the Act.       Furthermore, it is argued that the report neither discloses the caste       of the informant nor the allegations are that they were made in       public view. Also, the offending words are not purported to be made       for the reason that the informant is a person belonging to       Scheduled Caste.   7.   The learned counsel for the State on the contrary, submitted that       during investigations, certain persons have supported the version       of the informant. It is argued on behalf of respondent No. 2 that in       fact the appellant and his family are encroacher on the informant’s       land. Therefore, the appellant was rightly not granted any       indulgence by the High Court.    8.   Against the backdrop of these facts, it is pertinent to refer to the       Statement of Objects and Reasons of enactment of the Act. It is       provided as under:                “Despite various measures to improve the socio-              economic conditions of the Scheduled Castes and the              Scheduled Tribes, they remain vulnerable. They are              denied number of civil rights. They are subjected to                                                                             4             various   offences,    indignities,  humiliations    and             harassment. They have, in several brutal incidents,             been deprived of their life and property. Serious crimes             are committed against them for various historical, social             and economic reasons.              2. Because of the awareness created amongst the             Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes through             spread of education, etc., they are trying to assert their             rights and this is not being taken very kindly by the             others.     When they assert their rights and resist             practices of untouchability against them or demand             statutory minimum wages or refuse to do any bonded             and forced labour, the vested interests try to cow them             down and terrorise them. When the Scheduled Castes             and the Scheduled Tribes try to preserve their self-             respect or honour of their women, they become irritants             for the dominant and the mighty.         Occupation and             cultivation of even the Government allotted land by the             Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes is resented             and more often these people become victims of attacks             by the vested interests. Of late, there has bene an             increase in the disturbing trend of commission of certain             atrocities like making the Scheduled Caste persons eat             inedible substances like human excreta and attacks on             and mass killings of helpless Scheduled Castes and the             Scheduled Tribes and rape of women belonging to the             Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes. Under the             circumstances, the existing laws like the Protection of             Civil Rights Act, 1955 and the normal provisions of the             Indian Penal Code have been found to be inadequate to             check these crimes. A special Legislation to check and             deter crimes against them committed by non-Scheduled             Castes and non-Scheduled Tribes has, therefore, become             necessary.”   9.   The long title of the Act is to prevent the commission of offences of       atrocities against the members of the Scheduled Castes and the       Scheduled Tribes, to provide for Special Courts and Exclusive       Special Courts for the trial of such offences and for the relief and       rehabilitation of the victims of such offences and for matters       connected therewith or incidental thereto.                                                                            5 10.   The Act was enacted to improve the social economic conditions of        the vulnerable sections of the society as they have been subjected        to   various   offences    such    as   indignities,    humiliations   and        harassment. They have been deprived of life and property as well.        The object of the Act is thus to punish the violators who inflict        indignities, humiliations and harassment and commit the offence        as defined under Section 3 of the Act. The Act is thus intended to        punish the acts of the upper caste against the vulnerable section of        the society for the reason that they belong to a particular        community.   11.   It may be stated that the charge-sheet filed is for an offence under        Section 3(1)(x) of the Act. The said section stands substituted by        Act No. 1 of 2016 w.e.f. 26.1.2016. The substituted corresponding        provision is Section 3(1)(r) which reads as under:                “3(1)(r) intentionally insults or intimidates with intent to               humiliate a member of a Scheduled Caste or a               Scheduled Tribe in any place within public view;”   12.   The basic ingredients of the offence under Section 3(1)(r) of the Act        can be classified as “1) intentionally insults or intimidates with        intent to humiliate a member of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled        Tribe and 2) in any place within public view”.   13.   The offence under Section 3(1)(r) of the Act would indicate the        ingredient of intentional insult and intimidation with an intent to        humiliate a member of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe.                                                                                  6         All insults or intimidations to a person will not be an offence under          the Act unless such insult or intimidation is on account of victim          belonging to Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe. The object of the          Act is to improve the socio-economic conditions of the Scheduled          Castes and the Scheduled Tribes as they are denied number of civil          rights. Thus, an offence under the Act would be made out when a          member of the vulnerable section of the Society is subjected to          indignities, humiliations and harassment. The assertion of title over          the land by either of the parties is not due to either the indignities,          humiliations or harassment. Every citizen has a right to avail their          remedies in accordance with law. Therefore, if the appellant or his          family members have invoked jurisdiction of the civil court, or that          respondent No.2 has invoked the jurisdiction of the civil court, then          the parties are availing their remedies in accordance with the          procedure established by law. Such action is not for the reason that          respondent No.2 is member of Scheduled Caste.   14.     Another key ingredient of the provision is insult or intimidation in          “any place within public view”. What is to be regarded as “place in          public view” had come up for consideration before this Court in the          judgment reported as Swaran Singh & Ors. v. State through          Standing Counsel & Ors.5.         The Court had drawn distinction          between the expression “public place” and “in any place within          public view”. It was held that if an offence is committed outside the          building e.g. in a lawn outside a house, and the lawn can be seen   5     (2008) 8 SCC 435                                                                                7       by someone from the road or lane outside the boundary wall, then        the lawn would certainly be a place within the public view. On the        contrary, if the remark is made inside a building, but some        members of the public are there (not merely relatives or friends)        then it would not be an offence since it is not in the public view.        The Court held as under:                 “28. It has been alleged in the FIR that Vinod Nagar, the               first informant, was insulted by Appellants 2 and 3 (by               calling him a “chamar”) when he stood near the car               which was parked at the gate of the premises. In our               opinion, this was certainly a place within public view,               since the gate of a house is certainly a place within               public view. It could have been a different matter had               the alleged offence been committed inside a               building, and also was not in the public view. However, if               the offence is committed outside the building e.g. in a               lawn outside a house, and the lawn can be seen by               someone from the road or lane outside the boundary               wall, the lawn would certainly be a place within the               public view. Also, even if the remark is made inside a               building, but some members of the public are there (not               merely relatives or friends) then also it would be an               offence since it is in the public view. We must, therefore,               not confuse the expression “place within public view”               with the expression “public place”. A place can be a               private place but yet within the public view. On the               other hand, a public place would ordinarily mean a place               which is owned or leased by the Government or the               municipality (or other local body) or gaon sabha or an               instrumentality of the State, and not by private persons               or private bodies.”   15.   As per the FIR, the allegations of abusing the informant were within        the four walls of her building. It is not the case of the informant        that there was any member of the public (not merely relatives or        friends) at the time of the incident in the house.         Therefore, the        basic ingredient that the words were uttered “in any place within                                                                                8         public view” is not made out. In the list of witnesses appended to          the charge-sheet, certain witnesses are named but it could not be          said that those were the persons present within the four walls of          the building. The offence is alleged to have taken place within the          four walls of the building. Therefore, in view of the judgment of this          Court in Swaran Singh, it cannot be said to be a place within          public view as none was said to be present within the four walls of          the building as per the FIR and/or charge-sheet.   16.     There is a dispute about the possession of the land which is the          subject matter of civil dispute between the parties as per          respondent No.2 herself. Due to dispute, appellant and others were          not permitting respondent No.2 to cultivate the land for the last six          months. Since the matter is regarding possession of property          pending before the Civil Court, any dispute arising on account of          possession of the said property would not disclose an offence under          the Act unless the victim is abused, intimated or harassed only for          the reason that she belongs to Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe.   17.     In another judgment reported as Khuman Singh v. State of          Madhya Pradesh6, this Court held that in a case for applicability          of Section 3(2)(v) of the Act, the fact that the deceased belonged          to Scheduled Caste would not be enough to inflict enhanced          punishment.      This Court held that there was nothing to suggest          that the offence was committed by the appellant only because the          deceased belonged to Scheduled Caste. The Court held as under: 6     2019 SCC OnLine SC 1104                                                                              9                   “15. As held by the Supreme Court, the offence must be                   such so as to attract the offence under Section 3(2)(v) of                   the Act. The offence must have been committed against                   the person on the ground that such person is a member                   of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe. In the present                   case, the fact that the deceased was belonging                   to “Khangar”-Scheduled Caste is not disputed. There is                   no evidence to show that the offence was committed                   only on the ground that the victim was a member of the                   Scheduled Caste and therefore, the conviction of the                   appellant-accused under Section 3(2)(v) of the                   Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of                   Atrocities) Act is not sustainable.”   18.     Therefore, offence under the Act is not established merely on the          fact that the informant is a member of Scheduled Caste unless          there is an intention to humiliate a member of Scheduled Caste or          Scheduled Tribe for the reason that the victim belongs to such          caste.      In the present case, the parties are litigating over          possession of the land.        The allegation of hurling of abuses is          against a person who claims title over the property. If such person          happens to be a Scheduled Caste, the offence under Section 3(1)(r)          of the Act is not made out.   19.     This Court in a judgment reported as Dr. Subhash Kashinath          Mahajan v. State of Maharashtra & Anr. 7 issued certain          directions in respect of investigations required to be conducted          under the Act.      In a review filed by the Union against the said          judgment, this Court in a judgment reported as Union of India v.          State of Maharashtra & Ors.8 reviewed the directions issued by          this Court and held that if there is a false and unsubstantiated FIR,  7     (2018) 6 SCC 454 8     (2020) 4 SCC 761                                                                                 10         the proceedings under Section 482 of the Code can be invoked.          The Court held as under:                     “52. There is no presumption that the members of the                   Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes may misuse the                   provisions of law as a class and it is not resorted to by                   the members of the upper castes or the members of the                   elite class. For lodging a false report, it cannot be said                   that the caste of a person is the cause. It is due to the                   human failing and not due to the caste factor. Caste is                   not attributable to such an act. On the other hand,                   members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes                   due to backwardness hardly muster the courage to                   lodge even a first information report, much less, a false                   one. In case it is found to be false/unsubstantiated, it                   may be due to the faulty investigation or for other                   various reasons including human failings irrespective of                   caste factor. There may be certain cases which may be                   false that can be a ground for interference by the Court,                   but the law cannot be changed due to such misuse. In                   such a situation, it can be taken care of in proceeding                   under Section 482 CrPC.”   20.     Later, while examining the constitutionality of the provisions of the          Amending Act (Central Act No. 27 of 2018), this Court in a          judgment reported as Prathvi Raj Chauhan v. Union of India &          Ors.9 held that proceedings can be quashed under Section 482 of          the Code. It was held as under:                     “12. The Court can, in exceptional cases, exercise                   power under Section 482 CrPC for quashing the cases to                   prevent misuse of provisions on settled parameters, as                   already observed while deciding the review petitions.                   The legal position is clear, and no argument to the                   contrary has been raised.”   21.     In Gerige Pentaiah, one of the arguments raised was non-          disclosure of the caste of the accused but the facts were almost 9     (2020) 4 SCC 727                                                                                 11       similar as there was civil dispute between parties pending and the        allegation was that the accused has called abuses in the name of        the caste of the victim. The High Court herein has misread the        judgment of this Court in Ashabai Machindra Adhagale as it was        not a case about the caste of the victim but the fact that the        accused was belonging to upper caste was not mentioned in the        FIR. The High Court of Bombay had quashed the proceedings for        the reason that the caste of the accused was not mentioned in the        FIR, therefore, the offence under Section 3(1)(xi) of the Act is not        made out. In an appeal against the decision of the Bombay High        Court, this Court held that this will be the matter of investigation as        to whether the accused either belongs to or does not belong to        Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe.       Therefore, the High Court        erred in law to dismiss the quashing petition relying upon later        larger Bench judgment.  22.   The appellant had sought quashing of the charge-sheet on the        ground that the allegation does not make out an offence under the        Act against the appellant merely because respondent No. 2 was a        Scheduled Caste since the property dispute was not on account of        the fact that respondent No. 2 was a Scheduled Caste. The        property disputes between a vulnerable section of the society and        a person of upper caste will not disclose any offence under the Act        unless, the allegations are on account of the victim being a        Scheduled Caste. Still further, the finding that the appellant was        aware of the caste of the informant is wholly inconsequential as the                                                                               12       knowledge does not bar, any person to protect his rights by way of        a procedure established by law.  23.   This Court in a judgment reported as Ishwar Pratap Singh & Ors.        v. State of Uttar Pradesh & Anr.10 held that there is no        prohibition under the law for quashing the charge-sheet in part. In        a petition filed under Section 482 of the Code, the High Court is        required to examine as to whether its intervention is required for        prevention of abuse of process of law or otherwise to secure the        ends of justice. The Court held as under:                 “9. Having regard to the settled legal position on                external interference in investigation and the specific                facts of this case, we are of the view that the High Court                ought to have exercised its jurisdiction under Section                482 CrPC to secure the ends of justice. There is no                prohibition under law for quashing a charge-sheet in                part. A person may be accused of several offences                under different penal statutes, as in the instant case. He                could be aggrieved of prosecution only on a particular                charge or charges, on any ground available to him in                law. Under Section 482, all that the High Court is                required to examine is whether its intervention is                required for implementing orders under the Criminal                Procedure Code or for prevention of abuse of process, or                otherwise to secure the ends of justice. A charge-sheet                filed at the dictate of somebody other than the police                would amount to abuse of the process of law and hence                the High Court ought to have exercised its inherent                powers under Section 482 to the extent of the abuse.                There is no requirement that the charge-sheet has to be                quashed as a whole and not in part. Accordingly, this                appeal is allowed. The supplementary report filed by the                police, at the direction of the Commission, is quashed.”    24.   In view of the above facts, we find that the charges against the        appellant under Section 3(1)(r) of the Act are not made out.        Consequently, the charge-sheet to that extent is quashed.             The 10 (2018) 13 SCC 612                                                                               13          appeal is disposed of in the above terms.   25.      The FIR in respect of other offences will be tried by the competent           Court in accordance with law along with the criminal case 11, though           separately initiated, for the reason that it relates to interparty           dispute and is in respect of same subject matter of property,           despite of the fact that two different dates of the incident have           been provided by the parties.                                             .............................................J.

The present Civil Appeal has been filed to challenge the             impugned Judgment and Order dated 19.10.2016 passed by a             Division Bench of the Gujarat High Court, which affirmed the             Order of the Trial Court, allowing the application filed by             Defendant Nos. 2 and 3/Respondent Nos. 2 and 3 herein under             Order VII Rule 11(d), CPC holding that the suit filed by the             Appellant and Respondent Nos. 9 to 13 herein (hereinafter referred             to as the “Plaintiffs”) was barred by limitation.  Signature Not Verified   Digitally signed by  2.                        The subject-matter of the present proceedings pertains to a  ARJUN BISHT  Date: 2020.07.09  16:06:33 IST  Reason:                plot of agricultural land of old tenure, admeasuring approximately                                                       1      8701 sq. mtrs. in Revenue Survey No. 610, Block No.573 situated       in village Mota Varachha, Sub-District Surat (hereinafter referred       to as the “suit property”) which was in the ownership of the       Plaintiffs.   3.         The land was under restrictive tenure as per Section 73AA of       the Land Revenue Code. The Plaintiffs filed an application dated       13.05.2008 before the Collector, Surat to obtain permission for       selling the suit property to Respondent No.1/Defendant No.1,       which was non-irrigated, and stated that they had no objection to       the sale of the suit property.   4.         The Collector vide Order dated 19.06.2009, after carrying out       verification of the title of the Plaintiffs, permitted sale of the suit       property, and fixed the sale price of the suit property as per the       jantri issued by the State Government @ Rs. 2000/- per sq. mtr.,       which would work out to Rs. 1,74,02,000/-. The Collector granted       permission for the sale subject to the terms and conditions       contained in Section 73AA of the Land Revenue Code.             It was       stipulated that the purchaser shall make the payment by cheque,       and reference of the payment shall be made in the Sale Deed.                                            2 5.        After obtaining permission from the Collector, the Plaintiffs       sold the suit property to Respondent No.1 herein vide registered       Sale Deed dated 02.07.2009.           Respondent No. 1 - purchaser issued 36 cheques for       Rs.1,74,02,000 towards payment of the sale consideration in       favour of the Plaintiffs, the details of which were set out in the       registered Sale Deed dated 02.07.2009.   6.        The Respondent No. 1 subsequently sold the suit property to       Respondent Nos. 2 and 3 herein vide registered Sale Deed dated       01.04.2013, for a sale consideration of Rs. 2,01,00,000/-.   7.        On 15.12.2014, the Plaintiffs filed Special Civil Suit No.       718/2014 before the Principal Civil Judge, Surat against the       original purchaser i.e. Respondent No. 1, and also impleaded the       subsequent purchasers i.e. Respondent Nos. 2 and 3 as       defendants. It was inter alia prayed that the Sale Deed dated       02.07.2009 be cancelled and declared as being illegal, void,       ineffective and not binding on them, on the ground that the sale       consideration fixed by the Collector, had not been paid in entirety       by Respondent No. 1.           The Plaintiffs contended that they were totally illiterate, and       were not able to read and write, and were only able to put their                                       3      thumb impression on the Sale Deed dated 02.07.2009. The Sale       Deed was obtained without payment of full consideration. The       Respondent No.1 had paid only Rs. 40,000 through 6 cheques, and       remaining 30 cheques for Rs.1,73,62,000 were “bogus” cheques.       The Plaintiffs prayed for cancellation of the Sale Deed dated       02.07.2009, and also prayed that the subsequent Sale Deed dated       01.04.2013 be declared as illegal, void and ineffective; and, the       physical possession of the suit property be restored to the       Plaintiffs.   8.         Respondent Nos. 2 and 3 filed an Application for Rejection of       the Plaint under Order VII Rule 11 (a) and (d) of the CPC,       contending that the suit filed by the Plaintiffs was barred by       limitation, and that no cause of action had been disclosed in the       plaint.           It was inter alia submitted that the Plaintiffs had admitted the       execution of the Sale Deed dated 02.07.2009 in favour of       Respondent No.1 before the Sub-Registrar, Surat. The only dispute       now sought to be raised was that they had not received a part of       the sale consideration. This plea was denied as being incorrect.                                           4     It was further submitted that if the Sale Deed dated  02.07.2009 was being challenged, then the suit ought to have been  filed within three years i.e. on or before 02.07.2012.      It was further submitted that pursuant to the execution of the  registered Sale Deed dated 02.07.2009, the Plaintiffs had  participated in the proceedings before the Revenue Officer for  transfer of the suit property in the revenue records in favour of  Respondent No.1. On that basis, the suit property had been  transferred to Respondent No.1 vide Hakk Patrak Entry No. 6517  dated 24.07.2009. Before certifying the said entry, notice under  Section 135D of the Land Revenue Code had been duly served on  the Plaintiffs, and ever since, Respondent No. 1 had been paying  the land revenue on the suit property, and taking the produce  therefrom.      Respondent Nos. 2 and 3 further submitted that they had  purchased the suit property from Respondent No.1 after verifying  the title, and inspecting the revenue records. The Respondent No.1  had sold the suit property vide a registered Sale Deed dated  01.04.2013, on payment of valuable consideration of Rs.  2,01,00,000/-.     Pursuant    thereto,   the   suit   property   was  transferred in the name of Respondent Nos. 2 and 3 in the revenue  records.                                   5          It was further submitted that the Plaintiffs, with a view to       mislead the Court, had deliberately filed copies of the 7/12       extracts dated 20.07.2009, which was prior to the mutation being       effected in the name of Respondent No.1. It was submitted that       the suit was devoid of any merit, and clearly time-barred, and       liable to be rejected.   9.        The Trial Court carried out a detailed analysis of the       averments in the plaint alongwith the documents filed with the       plaint, including the registered Sale Deed dated 02.07.2009,       executed by the Plaintiffs. The undisputed facts which emerged       from the averments in the plaint was that the suit property was of       restrictive tenure under Section 73AA of the Land Revenue Code.       Since the Plaintiffs were in dire need of money, and wanted to sell       the suit property to Respondent No. 1, they had filed an application       before the Collector, Surat on 13.05.2008 to obtain permission for       sale of the suit property. The Collector vide Order dated       19.06.2009 granted permission to the Plaintiffs and fixed the sale       price at Rs. 1,74,02,000/- which was to be paid through cheques.       It was contended in the plaint that the Respondent No. 1 had in       fact paid only Rs. 40,000/-, and false cheques of Rs. 1,73,62,000/-       were issued, which remained unpaid.                                         6     On a perusal of the registered Sale Deed dated 02.07.2009,  [marked as Exhibit 3/9] it was noted that the Plaintiffs had in fact  accepted and acknowledged the payment of the full sale  consideration from Respondent No.1, through cheques which were  issued prior to the execution of the Sale Deed, during the period  07.07.2008 to 02.07.2009.      As per the Plaintiffs, the Sale Deed was executed on  02.07.2009 in favour of Respondent No.1, which was registered  before the Office of the Sub-Registrar, for which the Plaintiffs  would have remained personally present. The transaction having  been executed through a registered document, was in the public  domain, and in the knowledge of the Plaintiffs right from the  beginning.      The Trial Court noted that there was no averment in the plaint  that the cheques had not been received by them. Once the cheques  were received by them, in the normal course, they would have  presented the cheques for encashment within 6 months.           The  Court held that had the Plaintiffs not been able to encash 30  cheques, a complaint ought to have been filed, or proceedings  initiated for recovery of the unpaid sale consideration. There was  however, nothing on record to show that the Plaintiffs had made  any complaint in this regard for a period of over 5 years.                                   7     The Plaintiffs also failed to produce the returned cheques, their  passbooks, bank statements, or any other document to support  their averments in the plaint.      A notice for transfer of the suit property in the revenue records  under Section 135D was served on the Plaintiffs, to which no  objection was raised. The name of Respondent No. 1 was entered  into the revenue records, which was certified by the Revenue  Officer.      The Trial Court held that the period of limitation for filing the  suit was 3 years from the date of execution of the Sale Deed dated  02.07.2009. The suit was filed on 15.12.2014. The cause of action  as per the averments in the plaint had arisen when the Defendant  No.1/Respondent No.1 had issued ‘false’ or ‘bogus’ cheques to the  Plaintiffs in 2009. The suit for cancellation of the Sale Deed dated  02.07.2009 could have been filed by 2012, as per Articles 58 and  59 of the Limitation Act, 1963. The suit was however filed on  15.12.2014, which was barred by limitation.      The suit property was subsequently sold by Respondent No.1  to Respondent Nos. 2 and 3 by a registered Sale Deed dated  01.04.2013. Before purchasing the suit property, the Respondent  Nos. 2 and 3 had issued a public notice on 14.08.2012. The  Plaintiffs did not raise any objection to the same.                                   8             The Trial Court, on the basis of the settled position in law, held        that the suit of the Plaintiffs was barred by limitation, and allowed        the application under Order VII Rule 11(d) CPC.   10.          Aggrieved by the Judgment dated 12.08.2016 passed by the        Sr.    Civil   Judge,   Surat,   the    Plaintiffs   filed   First   Appeal        No.2324/2016 before the High Court of Gujarat at Ahmedabad.              The Division Bench of the High Court took note of the fact that        the Plaintiffs did not deny having executed the registered Sale Deed        dated 02.07.2009 in favour of Respondent No.1. In the said Sale        Deed, it was specifically admitted and acknowledged by the        Plaintiffs that they had received the full sale consideration. The        Sale Deed contained the complete particulars with respect to the        payment of sale consideration by Respondent No. 1 through 36        cheques, the particulars of which were recorded therein. Since the        execution of the Sale Deed was not disputed, and the conveyance        was duly registered in the presence of the Plaintiffs before the Sub-        Registrar, the Sale Deed could not be declared to be void, illegal,        or ineffective.              The suit property was subsequently sold by Respondent No. 1        in favour of Respondent Nos. 2 and 3 vide registered Sale Deed        dated 01.04.2013 for a sale consideration of Rs. 2,01,00,000/-.                                             9 Respondent Nos. 2 and 3 were bona fide purchasers for valuable  consideration.      The present suit for cancellation of the Sale Deed was filed by  the Plaintiffs after a period of over 5 years after the execution of  the Sale Deed dated 02.07.2009, and 1 year after the execution of  the Sale Deed dated 01.04.2013 by Respondent No.1. It was noted  that prior to the institution of the suit on 15.12.2014, at no point  of time did the Plaintiffs raise any grievance whatsoever, of not  having received the full sale consideration mentioned in the Sale  Deed dated 02.07.2009. It was for the first time that such an  allegation was made after over 5 years from the date of execution  of the Sale Deed dated 02.07.2009.      Since the suit in respect of the Sale Deed dated 02.07.2009  was held to be barred by law of limitation, the High Court was of  the view that the suit could not be permitted to be continued even  with respect to the subsequent Sale Deed dated 01.04.2013. The  Plaintiffs had not raised any allegation against Respondent Nos. 2  and 3, and there was no privity of contract between the Plaintiffs  and Respondent Nos. 2 and 3.      The High Court rightly affirmed the findings of the Trial Court,  and held that the suit was barred by limitation, since it was filed  beyond the period of limitation of three years.                                  10 11.        Aggrieved by the impugned Judgment and Order dated        12.08.2016 passed by the High Court, the original Plaintiff No.1        has filed the present Civil Appeal.   12.        We have heard the learned Counsel for the parties, perused        the plaint and documents filed therewith, as also the written        submissions filed on behalf of the parties.          12.1     We will first briefly touch upon the law applicable for                 deciding an application under Order VII Rule 11 CPC,                 which reads as under:                   “11. Rejection of plaint.– The plaint shall be rejected in                  the following cases:–                      (a) where it does not disclose a cause of action;                      (b) where the relief claimed in undervalued, and the                      plaintiff, on being required by the Court to correct the                      valuation within a time to be fixed by the Court, fails to                      do so;                      (c) where the relief claimed is properly valued but the                      plaint is written upon paper insufficiently stamped, and                      the plaintiff, on being required by the Court to supply the                      requisite stamp-paper within a time to be fixed by the                      Court, fails to do so;                      (d) where the suit appears from the statement in                      the plaint to be barred by any law;                      (e) where it is not filed in duplicate;                      (f) where the plaintiff fails to comply with the provisions                      of rule 9                          Provided that the time fixed by the Court for the                      correction of the valuation or supplying of the requisite                      stamp-paper shall not be extended unless the Court, for                      reasons to be recorded, is satisfied that the plaintiff was                      prevent by any cause of exceptional nature for correction                      the valuation or supplying the requisite stamp-paper, as                      the case may be, within the time fixed by the Court and                      that refusal to extend such time would cause grave                      injustice to the plaintiff.”                                                              (emphasis supplied)                                                11                      The remedy under Order VII Rule 11 is an            independent and special remedy, wherein the Court is            empowered to summarily dismiss a suit at the threshold,            without proceeding to record evidence, and conducting a            trial, on the basis of the evidence adduced, if it is satisfied            that the action should be terminated on any of the grounds            contained in this provision.                       The underlying object of Order VII Rule 11 (a) is            that if in a suit, no cause of action is disclosed, or the suit            is barred by limitation under Rule 11 (d), the Court would            not permit the plaintiff to unnecessarily protract the            proceedings in the suit. In such a case, it would be            necessary to put an end to the sham litigation, so that            further judicial time is not wasted.                       In Azhar Hussain v. Rajiv Gandhi1 this Court held            that the whole purpose of conferment of powers under this            provision      is   to   ensure      that    a    litigation    which     is            meaningless, and bound to prove abortive, should not be     11986 Supp. SCC 315 Followed in Maharaj Shri Manvendrasinhji Jadeja v. Rajmata Vijaykunverba w/o Late Maharaja Mahedrasinhji, (1998) 2 GLH 823                                             12              permitted to waste judicial time of the court, in the               following words :                   “12. …The whole purpose of conferment of such power is to                  ensure that a litigation which is meaningless, and bound to                  prove abortive should not be permitted to occupy the time of                  the Court, and exercise the mind of the respondent. The                  sword of Damocles need not be kept hanging over his head                  unnecessarily without point or purpose. Even if an ordinary                  civil litigation, the Court readily exercises the power to reject                  a plaint, if it does not disclose any cause of action.”        12.2       The power conferred on the court to terminate a civil               action is, however, a drastic one, and the conditions               enumerated in Order VII Rule 11 are required to be strictly               adhered to.        12.3       Under Order VII Rule 11, a duty is cast on the Court to               determine whether the plaint discloses a cause of action               by scrutinizing the averments in the plaint2, read in               conjunction with the documents relied upon, or whether               the suit is barred by any law.        12.4       Order VII Rule 14(1) provides for production of               documents, on which the plaintiff places reliance in his               suit, which reads as under :                   “Order 7 Rule 14: Production of document on which                  plaintiff sues or relies.–                  (1)Where a plaintiff sues upon a document or relies upon                  document in his possession or power in support of his claim,                  he shall enter such documents in a list, and shall produce it                  in Court when the plaint is presented by him and shall, at  2   Liverpool & London S.P. & I Assn. Ltd. v. M.V. Sea Success I & Anr., (2004) 9 SCC 512.                                                  13          the same time deliver the document and a copy thereof, to          be filed with the plaint.          (2)Where any such document is not in the possession or          power of the plaintiff, he shall, wherever possible, state in          whose possession or power it is.          (3)A document which ought to be produced in Court by the          plaintiff when the plaint is presented, or to be entered in the          list to be added or annexed to the plaint but is not produced          or entered accordingly, shall not, without the leave of the          Court, be received in evidence on his behalf at the hearing          of the suit.          (4)Nothing in this rule shall apply to document produced for          the cross examination of the plaintiff's witnesses, or,          handed over to a witness merely to refresh his memory.”                                                  (emphasis supplied)           Having regard to Order VII Rule 14 CPC, the documents         filed alongwith the plaint, are required to be taken into         consideration for deciding the application under Order VII         Rule 11 (a). When a document referred to in the plaint,         forms the basis of the plaint, it should be treated as a part         of the plaint.  12.5     In exercise of power under this provision, the Court         would determine if the assertions made in the plaint are         contrary to statutory law, or judicial dicta, for deciding         whether a case for rejecting the plaint at the threshold is         made out.  12.6     At this stage, the pleas taken by the defendant in the         written statement and application for rejection of the plaint                                         14              on the merits, would be irrelevant, and cannot be adverted               to, or taken into consideration.3        12.7      The test for exercising the power under Order VII Rule               11 is that if the averments made in the plaint are taken in               entirety, in conjunction with the documents relied upon,               would the same result in a decree being passed. This test               was laid down in Liverpool & London S.P. & I Assn. Ltd. v.               M.V.Sea Success I & Anr.,4 which reads as :                  “139. Whether a plaint discloses a cause of action or not is                 essentially a question of fact. But whether it does or does                 not must be found out from reading the plaint itself. For the                 said purpose, the averments made in the plaint in their                 entirety must be held to be correct. The test is as to whether                 if the averments made in the plaint are taken to be correct                 in their entirety, a decree would be passed.”                         In Hardesh Ores (P.) Ltd. v. Hede & Co.5 the Court               further held that it is not permissible to cull out a sentence               or a passage, and to read it in isolation.                       It is the               substance, and not merely the form, which has to be               looked into. The plaint has to be construed as it stands,               without addition or subtraction of words. If the allegations               in the plaint prima facie show a cause of action, the court     3   Sopan Sukhdeo Sable v. Assistant Charity Commissioner, (2004) 3 SCC 137 4   (2004) 9 SCC 512. 5   (2007) 5 SCC 614.                                               15            cannot embark upon an enquiry whether the allegations             are true in fact.6      12.8      If on a meaningful reading of the plaint, it is found that             the suit is manifestly vexatious and without any merit, and             does not disclose a right to sue, the court would be justified             in exercising the power under Order VII Rule 11 CPC.      12.9      The power under Order VII Rule 11 CPC may be             exercised by the Court at any stage of the suit, either             before registering the plaint, or after issuing summons to             the defendant, or before conclusion of the trial, as held by             this Court in the judgment of Saleem Bhai v. State of             Maharashtra.7 The plea that once issues are framed, the             matter must necessarily go to trial was repelled by this             Court in Azhar Hussain (supra).      12.10     The provision of Order VII Rule 11 is mandatory in             nature. It states that the plaint “shall” be rejected if any             of the grounds specified in clause (a) to (e) are made out. If             the Court finds that the plaint does not disclose a cause of             action, or that the suit is barred by any law, the Court has             no option, but to reject the plaint.  6 D. Ramachandran v. R.V. Janakiraman, (1999) 3 SCC 267; See also Vijay Pratap Singh v.  Dukh Haran Nath Singh, AIR 1962 SC 941. 7 (2003) 1 SCC 557.                                                16 13.              “Cause of action” means every fact which would be        necessary for the plaintiff to prove, if traversed, in order to support        his right to judgment. It consists of a bundle of material facts,        which are necessary for the plaintiff to prove in order to entitle him        to the reliefs claimed in the suit.                 In Swamy Atmanand v. Sri Ramakrishna Tapovanam8 this        Court held :                        “24. A cause of action, thus, means every fact, which if                       traversed, it would be necessary for the plaintiff to prove an                       order to support his right to a judgment of the court. In other                       words, it is a bundle of facts, which taken with the law                       applicable to them gives the plaintiff a right to relief against                       the defendant. It must include some act done by the                       defendant since in the absence of such an act, no cause of                       action can possibly accrue. It is not limited to the actual                       infringement of the right sued on but includes all the                       material facts on which it is founded”                                                                 (emphasis supplied)                 In T. Arivandandam v. T.V. Satyapal & Anr.9 this Court held        that while considering an application under Order VII Rule 11 CPC        what is required to be decided is whether the plaint discloses a real        cause of action, or something purely illusory, in the following        words : -                        “5. …The learned Munsiff must remember that if on a                       meaningful – not formal – reading of the plaint it is                       manifestly vexatious, and meritless, in the sense of not                       disclosing a clear right to sue, he should exercise his power                       under O. VII, R. 11, C.P.C. taking care to see that the ground                       mentioned therein is fulfilled. And, if clever drafting has         8   (2005) 10 SCC 51.       9   (1977) 4 SCC 467.                                                    17                       created the illusion of a cause of action, nip it in the bud at                       the first hearing …”                                                                  (emphasis supplied)                 Subsequently, in I.T.C. Ltd. v. Debt Recovery Appellate        Tribunal,10 this Court held that law cannot permit clever drafting        which creates illusions of a cause of action. What is required is        that a clear right must be made out in the plaint.                 If, however, by clever drafting of the plaint, it has created the        illusion of a cause of action, this Court in Madanuri Sri        Ramachandra Murthy v. Syed Jalal11 held that it should be nipped        in the bud, so that bogus litigation will end at the earliest stage.                 The Court must be vigilant against any camouflage or        suppression, and determine whether the litigation is utterly        vexatious, and an abuse of the process of the court.  14.            The Limitation Act, 1963 prescribes a time-limit for the        institution of all suits, appeals, and applications. Section 2(j)        defines the expression “period of limitation” to mean the period of        limitation prescribed in the Schedule for suits, appeals or        applications. Section 3 lays down that every suit instituted after        the prescribed period, shall be dismissed even though limitation           10   (1998) 2 SCC 170.       11   (2017) 13 SCC 174.                                                   18 may not have been set up as a defence. If a suit is not covered by  any specific article, then it would fall within the residuary article.           Articles 58 and 59 of the Schedule to the 1963 Act, prescribe  the period of limitation for filing a suit where a declaration is  sought, or cancellation of an instrument, or rescission of a  contract, which reads as under :            Description of suit      Period of       Time from which                                   limitation        period begins to                                                             run          58. To obtain any        Three years     When the right to          other declaration.                       sue first accrues.          59. To cancel or set     Three years     When       the    facts          aside an instrument                      entitling the plaintiff          or decree or for the                     to      have        the          rescission    of   a                     instrument or decree          contract.                                cancelled      or    set                                                   aside or the contract                                                   rescinded          first                                                   become known to                                                   him.             The period of limitation prescribed under Articles 58 and 59  of the 1963 Act is three years, which commences from the date  when the right to sue first accrues.           In Khatri Hotels Pvt. Ltd. & Anr. v. Union of India & Anr.,12 this  Court held that the use of the word ‘first’ between the words ‘sue’  and ‘accrued’, would mean that if a suit is based on multiple  causes of action, the period of limitation will begin to run from the    12   (2011) 9 SCC 126.                                        19 date when the right to sue first accrues. That is, if there are  successive violations of the right, it would not give rise to a fresh  cause of action, and the suit will be liable to be dismissed, if it is  beyond the period of limitation counted from the date when the  right to sue first accrued.           A three-Judge Bench of this Court in State of Punjab v.  Gurdev Singh,13 held that the Court must examine the plaint and  determine when the right to sue first accrued to the plaintiff, and  whether on the assumed facts, the plaint is within time. The words  “right to sue” means the right to seek relief by means of legal  proceedings. The right to sue accrues only when the cause of  action arises. The suit must be instituted when the right asserted  in the suit is infringed, or when there is a clear and unequivocal  threat to infringe such right by the defendant against whom the  suit is instituted.           Order VII Rule 11(d) provides that where a suit appears from  the averments in the plaint to be barred by any law, the plaint shall  be rejected.     13   (1991) 4 SCC 1.                                      20 15. Analysis and Findings          We have carefully perused the averments in the plaint read     with the documents relied upon.        15.1 On a reading of the plaint and the documents relied upon,             it is clear that the Plaintiffs have admitted the execution of             the registered Sale Deed dated 02.07.2009 in favour of             Defendant No.1/Respondent No.1 herein.

Chandrachud, J    1        The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission 1 dismissed a  consumer complaint filed by 339 flat buyers, accepting the defence of DLF  Southern Homes Pvt. Ltd. and Annabel Builders and Developers Pvt. Ltd. that  there was no deficiency of service on their part in complying with their contractual  obligations and, that despite a delay in handing over the possession of the  residential flats, the purchasers were not entitled to compensation in excess of  what was stipulated in the Apartment Buyers Agreement2.     2        The complaint before the NCDRC was initially instituted by nine flat  buyers. These nine complainants had booked residential flats in a project called  Westend Heights at New Town, DLF, BTM Extension at Begu, Bengaluru. The  project was being developed in an area admeasuring 27.5 acres and was to  consist of 1980 units, spread across nineteen towers each consisting of a stilt  and eighteen floors.    3        The Brochure of the first respondent advertised the nature of the project  and the amenities which would be provided to buyers. It held out the following  representations on the basis of which buyers were induced to invest:   1     “NCDRC” 2     “ABA”                                             2 “New Town - the premier choice for Bangalore living.

The flat buyers entered into  agreements with the developer. Clause 11(a) of the ABA indicated that the  developer would endeavour to complete construction within a period of thirty-six  months from the date of the execution of the agreement save and except for  force majeure conditions. Clause 11(a) provided:               “11. (a) Schedule for Possession of the Said Apartment              The Company/LOC based on the present plans and              estimates and subject to all just exceptions, endeavors to              complete construction of the Said Building /Said Apartment              within a period of thirty six (36) months from the date of              execution of this Agreement unless there shall be delay or              failure due to Force Majeure conditions including but not              limited to reasons mentioned in Clauses 11(b) and 11(c) or              due to failure of Allottee to pay in time the Total Price and              other charges taxes, securities etc. and dues/payments or              any failure on the part of the Allottee to abide by all or any of              the terms and conditions of this Agreement.”                                                    5 5     Force majeure stipulations were illustrated in sub-clauses (b) and (c) of  clause 11, which included delay due to the reasons beyond the control of the  developer and failure to deliver possession due to Government rules, orders or  notifications, respectively. Construction was behind schedule. The flat purchasers  were informed on 12 January 2011 that possession of the apartments was  expected to be completed by the middle of 2012. This assurance was not fulfilled.  By a communication dated 18 June 2013, the developers issued a revised  timeline intimating all flat buyers that the delivery of possession would commence  from October 2013. However, on 8 August 2013 another communication was  issued stating that the real estate industry was affected by an economic slow-  down which had hampered the pace of construction. The date for handing over  possession was extended to June 2014. A tentative schedule for delivery was  indicated under which Towers D1 and D2 would be handed over by January  2014, and Towers A3 to A6, A7, B3 and B4 would be handed over by May 2014.  On 8 August 2014, the timelines for handing over possession were again  extended by the developers : under the revised schedule the flats in Towers D1  and D2 were to be handed over in August 2014, those in A1 to A-7 in February  2015, B1 to B6 in April 2015 and C1 to C4 in June 2015. On 4 May 2015, the  developers issued another communication indicating the progress of the work  and informed the purchasers that site visits had been initiated for the project “till  we receive the occupancy certificate for clusters A, B and C”. This is an  admission of the fact that until then the occupation certificate had not been  received. The obligation to handover possession within a period of thirty-six  months was not fulfilled.                                             6 6         The first batch of nine flat purchasers moved a consumer complaint before  the NCDRC complaining of a breach by the developer of the obligation,  contractually assumed, under the terms of the ABA. Since the nine complainants  purported to represent the entire group of flat purchasers, a notice of the  complaint under Section 12(1)(c) of the Consumer Protection Act 19863 was  published in the newspapers.    7         Numerous applications for impleadment were allowed by the NCDRC and  an amended complaint was ordered to be filed. On the complainants moving an  application under Section 12(1)(c), the NCDRC by its order dated 21 November  2017 permitted them to file the complaint on behalf or for the benefit of all the flat  buyers who were interested in the reliefs. However, flat buyers who had (i)  executed deeds of conveyance; or (ii) executed affidavits while accepting the  agreed compensation in full and final satisfaction; or (iii) received possession  within the stipulated time period; or (iv) had sold their flats after the execution of  the conveyance; or (v) who were subsequent purchasers having purchased the  flat after the execution of the conveyance deed were to remain outside the  purview of the proceedings. Further, the buyers from whom Preferential Location  Charges, charges for the preferential location of the apartment, were not charged  and were not chargeable were to remain out of the class on whose behalf or  benefit the complaint was instituted. On a challenge to the order, this Court by an   3     “CP Act 1986”                                              7 order dated 10 April 2018 directed:                            “Since the complaint filed by the appellants was only by nine                           persons jointly for their benefit, the same could not be treated                           to be in representative capacity. Accordingly, the impugned                           order is set aside.                             Aggrieved parties are at liberty to file an appropriate fresh                           application under Section 12(1)(c) of the Consumer                           Protection Act, 1986 before the National Consumer Disputes                           Redressal Commission within two weeks from today. The                           same may be disposed of by the National Commission in                           accordance with law within three months from the date of                           filing of such an application.”     8          Pursuant to the liberty which was granted by this Court, an I.A.4 was filed  before the NCDRC under Section 12(1)(c). The application was disposed of on  13 July 2018 which led to an appeal before this Court.    9          On 28 September 2018, this Court set aside the order of the NCDRC with  the following directions:                            “Having heard learned counsel for the appellants, we are of                           the view that the impugned judgment dated 13.07.2018                           needs to be set aside. We set it aside and direct the National                           Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission to treat the                           complaint, as amended, that has been filed, as a complaint                           filed on behalf of all 339 persons and to proceed on merits.                             It will be open for the respondents to give their say on the                           merits of each of the 339 complainants.                             The Commission will decide the matter within a period of six                           months from today.                             The Civil Appeals are disposed of accordingly.”    4     IA No. 8083 of 2013                                                           8 10    Procedural directions issued upon several impleadment applications  resulted in a further order of this Court of 8 May 2019 reiterating that the  complaint would be treated as having been filed on behalf of 339 persons. By its  order dated 28 September 2018, which was reiterated again on 8 May 2019, this  Court had laid down a peremptory time schedule of six months for the disposal of  the complaint. Eventually, on 2 July 2019, the complaint was dismissed by the  NCDRC.     11    Civil Appeal No 6239 of 2019 comprises of 83 appellants. Civil Appeal No  6303 of 2019 comprises of 88 appellants. Thus, there are before this Court a total  of 171 flat purchasers in the appeals. The complaint before the NCDRC, which  was confined by the order of this Court dated 28 September 2018 to 339  complainants, now covers a more restricted field of 171 flat purchasers.  Annexure-1 to Civil Appeal No 6239 of 2019 contains a tabulation of (i) names of  the flat purchasers; (ii) dates on which the flats were booked; (iii) dates on which  the ABAs were signed; (iv) dates by which possession was to be handed over  under the ABAs; and (v) dates on which the letter for possession was issued by  the developers.     12    The NCDRC divided the group of 339 flat buyers into six groups based on  whether or not they had taken possession, executed deeds of conveyance,  settled the dispute or sold the flats before or during the pendency of the  complaint or their applications for impleadment:                                             9                  ?   Group A: Complainants who took possession of their                      flats before the filing of the complaint/impleadment                      applications.                    ?   Group B: Complainants who took possession and                      executed deeds of conveyance during the pendency                      of the complaint/impleadment applications.                    ?   Group C: Complainants who took possession during                      the pendency of the complaint/impleadment                      applications but have not executed deeds of                      conveyance.                    ?   Group D: Complainants who settled their dispute                      during the pendency of the complaint/ impleadment                      applications.                    ?   Group E: Complainants who sold their flats during the                      pendency of the complaint/impleadment applications.                    ?   Group F: Complainants who have not taken                      possession of the flats and have not executed a deed                      of conveyance.     13    The NCDRC held that flat buyers in Groups A and B who had taken  possession before the filing of the complaint / impleadment applications and  those who took possession and executed deeds of conveyance before or during  the pendency of the proceedings would not be entitled to pursue their claims. The  execution of the deed of conveyance, according to the NCDRC, is a transfer of a  right in property and it is not within the jurisdiction of the Commission to entertain  a grievance that the conveyances have been entered into under coercion.  Additionally, according to NCDRC, under the conveyance deed, such flat buyers  had accorded their satisfaction to the services provided by the developer and                                                10 voluntarily discharged the developer of all its liabilities under the ABA. As regards  flat purchasers in Group C, the NCDRC noted that even those who have taken  possession but have not executed a deed of conveyance have voluntarily  discharged the developer. The NCDRC observed that flat buyers in Group C had  taken possession without protest, without its permission and without lodging any  complaint with it after taking the possession. Those in Group D who had settled  their dispute during the pendency of the complaint were held to be estopped from  pursuing their grievances. The NCDRC did not accept the contention of the flat  buyers in Group D that that they had settled the matter under coercion and undue  influence since, according to the NCDRC, no specific facts and circumstances  were pleaded by such flat buyers which made them surrender their free will. The  buyers in Group E who have sold their flats during the pendency of the complaint  were held to have no subsisting right. The NCDRC noted that as regards Group F  (complainants who had neither taken possession nor executed a conveyance), as  many as 337 out of 339 flat purchasers had in fact taken possession. The  NCDRC had to deal with the claims of two remaining complainants, who had  accepted the delayed compensation but did not accept possession. Their  complaints were dismissed.     14          The primary grounds on which compensation have been sought before the  NCDRC were:       (i)      Delay in handing over possession of the flats;       (ii)     Reimbursement of taxes and interest charged to the flat purchasers                under clause 1.10 of the ABA;                                                 11 (iii)   Deficiency in providing amenities; (iv)    Levy of electricity charges by the developer; and  (v)     Failure to construct the club house.     15      The NCDRC, in the course of its judgment, observed that delay in the  handing over of flats to the flat purchasers was admitted. While recording a  finding of fact that there was an admitted delay on the part of the developer, the  NCDRC held that the agreements provided compensation at the rate of Rs 5 per  square foot of the super area for every month of delay. The NCDRC held that the  flat purchasers who agreed to this stipulation in the agreements were not entitled  to seek any amount in addition. Paragraph 470 of the judgment of the NCDRC  contains its finding:                    “470. There is no dispute to the fact that the completion of the                   project had been delayed. Delay had been acknowledged by                   the opposite parties. They had also offered to these                   complainants the delayed compensation calculated @ Rs 5/-                   per sq. ft. of the super area.”     The NCDRC observed that the developer had while computing the final demand  made an adjustment on account of delayed compensation at the rate stipulated in  the ABA. The flat purchasers having been provided credit at the rate agreed by  the developers, it was held that no further entitlement existed under the law. In  the view of the NCDRC, the flat purchasers had failed to prove that the stipulation  contained in the agreement for the payment of compensation at Rs 5 per square  foot was unreasonable. In taking this view, the Commission has lent support to its  decision by relying upon the decisions of this Court in DLF Homes Panchkula                                                 12 Pvt. Ltd. v. D S Dhanda, Etc.5 (“Dhanda”) and Ghaziabad Development  Authority v. Balbir Singh6(“Balbir Singh”). On the merits of the other  grievances, the NCDRC has held that        (i)        The charges recovered towards tax and interest are in terms of clause                   1.10 of the ABA;        (ii)       Charges recovered for electricity are in terms of the ABA;        (iii)      The levy of parking charges is valid; and        (iv)       The club house has been constructed.    16            In order to facilitate the final disposal of the Civil Appeals, counsel  appearing on behalf of the appellants formulated the nature of the grievances of  the flat buyers in the written submissions tendered during the hearing. Mr  Prashant Bhushan, learned Counsel appearing for the appellants has formulated  his submissions under the following heads:        (i)        There is a gross delay ranging between two and four years in handing                   over possession and the flat buyers ought not to be constrained by the                   terms of the agreement which are one-sided and unreasonable;        (ii)       The execution of conveyances or settlement deeds would not operate                   to preclude the flat buyers from claiming compensation. The emails of                   the developer clearly indicate that the flat buyers were not permitted to                   execute conveyances or to receive possession under protest;        (iii)      The amenities which have been contracted for have not been provided  5     2019 SCC OnLine SC 689 6     (2004) 5 SCC 65                                                   13        by the developers; and  (iv)   The flat buyers are not liable to indemnify the developer for the demand         of interest and penalty raised by the tax authorities as a result of the         failure to deposit the tax on time. During the oral arguments, it was         clarified that only interest has been recovered from the flat buyers.    The above submissions of Mr Prashant Bhushan have been reiterated in the  submissions urged before the Court by Mr Bishwajit Bhattacharya, learned Senior  Counsel appearing on behalf of another group of purchasers. Mr R  Balasubramanian, learned Senior Counsel has, while adopting the submissions  which were urged by Mr Prashant Bhushan, advanced submissions on the levy of  electricity charges and charges for parking spaces.     17     Opposing the submissions which have been urged on behalf of the  appellants, Mr Pinaki Misra, learned Senior Counsel urged that:  (i)    Despite the order of this Court dated 28 September 2018, no evidence         has been led by the complainants to discharge the onus placed upon         them to establish coercion or duress while executing conveyances or         settlements;  (ii)   Possession of the complex, which is situated on land admeasuring         about 27 acres and comprising of 813 apartments in nineteen towers         has been handed over between four to six years ago and the developer         has transferred his right, title and interest to the Residents? Welfare         Association (“RWA”);                                            14 (iii)   The allottees have benefited by the appreciation in the value of their          flats;  (iv)    Out of 171 applicants, 145 have received compensation at the agreed          rate while handing over possession. The allotments were escalation          free and the burden of increased costs has been borne by the          developer;  (v)     Under clause 14 of the ABA, the flat buyers have been compensated at          the rate of Rs 5 per square foot per month which would work out to          about Rs 7500 per month for a flat admeasuring 1500 square feet. No          proof or measure of actual loss suffered has been adduced;  (vi)    The facts pertaining to the appellants would indicate that:              (a)   Eighteen appellants executed conveyances before filing the                    complaints;              (b)   Fifty-four appellants executed conveyances during the course                    of the proceedings;              (c)   Fifty appellants executed conveyances after the impugned                    judgment;              (d)   The above individuals include 11 who have entered into                    written settlement deeds;              (e)   There is no delay in offering possession to seven appellants;                    and              (f)   Three appellants are continuing to agitate their grievances                    despite having transferred their rights in the flats. Out of 171                                           15             appellants, 122 executed conveyances before the complaint;              during the pendency of the proceedings or thereafter. Eleven              appellants who have entered into settlements did not raise a              ground of coercion prior to a reply which was filed in              December 2018 shortly before the final hearing;  (vii)       As regards the construction of facilities and amenities, a club house              containing a swimming pool, gymnasium, tennis court, indoor              badminton court and squash courts has been constructed and an              occupation certificate has been received on 13 May 2019. The RWA is              conscious of the fact that difficulties in the allotment arose as a result of              the action of the Bangalore Development Authority7 which led to the              filing of writ proceedings before the High Court of Karnataka both by the              developer and the RWA. Even after the receipt of the occupation              certificate, the developers have been corresponding with BDA for              permission to hand over possession to the RWA. Other amenities              including a school and health care facilities were going to be developed              in the entire township comprising of 80 acres of which the complex of              27 acres was a part. The flat buyers were aware of the fact that under              the terms of the ABA, the allottees have no right, title or interest in the              amenities outside their residential complex and forming a part of the              wider complex of 80 acres. Moreover, this issue is rendered academic              since the area around DLF township has become urbanized where              adequate facilities are available;   7     “BDA”                                                     16       (viii)   Clauses 1.3, 1.10, 2 and 3 require the allottees to bear tax liabilities                 including towards works contract tax. When the project commenced in                 2009, there was an absence of clarity in regard to the liability on                 account of works contract tax which was settled eventually by the                 judgment of this Court in Larsen and Toubro Limited v. State of                 Karnataka8. It was as a result of this judgment that the issue was                 settled following which, the developer while computing the amount                 payable in the final statements of accounts passed on the liability on                 account of the interest (but not towards penalty) on a proportionate                 basis in terms of clause 1.10 of the ABA;        (ix)     Clause 23(b) entitles the developer to raise a demand on a                 proportionate basis from the flat buyers for electricity charges. Initially,                 BESCOM provided a connection for electricity but subsequently as a                 substantial load was required, the developer was permitted to build its                 own electricity sub-station. This was built at a cost of Rs. 18.01 crores                 for which the pro rata cost could be allocated to flat buyers in terms of                 clause 23(b); and        (x)      The price of the apartment, as agreed in the ABA, included in the                 breakup, parking charges for exclusive use of earmarked parking                 spaces. Parking charges were also revealed upfront in the brochure.                 The appellants had erroneously relied on the decision of this Court in                 Nahalchand Laloochand Private Limited v. Panchali Cooperative     8     (2014) 1 SCC 708                                                  17           Housing Society Limited9, which turned on the construction of the            provisions of the Maharashtra Apartment Ownership Act 1971 and            Development Control Regulations for Greater Bombay 1991. This has            subsequently been explained in the decision in DLF Limited v.            Manmohan Lowe10. There is no prohibition in the Karnataka Apartment            Ownership Act upon the developer providing earmarked parking            charges in the breakup of the total price of the apartment.  The rival submissions will now be analysed.    Compensation for delayed possession  18        The fulcrum of the case of the developer rests on clause 14 of the ABA  which is in the following terms:                           “14. The Allottee agrees and understands that if the company                          is unable to give possession within the period as mentioned                          above or such extended period as permitted under this                          Agreement, due to reasons other than those mentioned in this                          Agreement, then the Company agrees to pay only to the                          Allottee and not to anyone else, subject to the Allottee, not                          being in default under any terms of this Agreement                          compensation @ Rs. 5/- per sq. feet of the Super Area of the                          said apartment per month for the period of such Delay. The                          adjustment of such compensation shall be done only at the                          time of execution of the Conveyance Deed of the Said                          Apartment to the Allottee first named under this Agreement                          and not, earlier.”     19        Clause 11(a) of the ABA indicates that subject to “all just exceptions” the  developer endeavoured to complete construction within a period of thirty-six  months from the date of the execution of the agreement unless hindered by force  9     (2010) 9 SCC 536 10      (2014) 12 SCC 231                                                        18 majeure conditions. Undoubtedly, the expression „endeavour? indicates that the  developer did not bind itself to an inflexible timeline of thirty-six months. But then  again, the timeline of thirty-six moths was subject to just exceptions and could be  excused in the event of force majeure conditions coming into operation. By the  provisions of clause 14, the developer agreed to compensate the flat buyers at  the rate of Rs. 5 per square feet of the super area of the apartment per month for  the period of delay. According to the developer (i) the flat purchasers are bound  by the above stipulations under which their entitlement was to receive  compensation at the agreed rate (and hence not beyond); and (ii) no evidence  has been adduced to indicate that the rate which has been prescribed in the  agreement is unreasonable. The developer relies on the observation in the  decision of this Court in Dhanda11 that when parties have agreed to a  consequence of delay in handing over possession, there must be exceptional  and strong reasons for the consumer fora to award compensation at more than  the agreed rate. In assessing these submissions, we must at the outset note the  submission of Mr Prashant Bhushan, learned Counsel that:                  “There are a total of 4 blocks in „WESTEND HEIGHTS?                 project. In Blocks A, B and C, the delay is huge, over 4 years.                 For block D, the average delay is 2 years. Out of 339                 complainants, for 268, the delay is huge, over 4 years.

Leave granted.       2.        The reference made to this Constitution Bench relates      to the grant of time for filing response to a complaint under the      provisions of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 (for short ‘the      Act’). The first question referred is as to whether Section 13(2)      (a) of the Consumer Protection Act, which provides for the      respondent/opposite party filing its response to the complaint      within 30 days or such extended period, not exceeding 15 days,      should be read as mandatory or directory; i.e., whether the      District Forum has power to extend the time for filing the      response beyond the period of 15 days, in addition to 30 days.      The second question which is referred is as to what would be                                                                   5  the commencing point of limitation of 30 days stipulated under  the aforesaid Section.   3.        The first question was referred by a two judge Bench of  this Court vide an Order dated 11.02.2016 passed in Civil Appeal  No(s).1083­1084    of    2016,   M/s    Bhasin      Infotech    and  Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. versus M/s Grand Venezia Buyers  Association (Reg), the relevant portion of which is as under:                 “There is an apparent conflict               between the decisions of this Court               in Topline Shoes Limited vs.               Corporation Bank [(2002) 6 SCC 33],               Kailash Vs. Nankhu [(2005) 4 SCC               480],     Salem      Advocate      Bar               Association Vs. Union of India               [(2005) 6 SCC 344] on the one hand               and J.J. Merchant & Ors. Vs.               Shrinath Chaturvedi [(2002) 6 SCC               635 and NIA Vs. Hilli Multipurpose               Cold Storage [2014 AIOL 4615] on               the other in so far as the power of               the Courts to extend time for filing of               written     statement/reply     to   a               complaint is concerned. The earlier               mentioned line of decisions take the               view that the relevant provisions               including those of Order 8 Rule 1 of               the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 are               directory in nature and the Courts               concerned have the power to extend               time for filing the written statement.               The second line of decisions which               are also of coordinate Benches                                                              6                however takes a contrary view and               hold that when it comes to power of               the Consumer Fora to extend the               time for filing a reply there is no               such power.                   Since the question that falls for               determination here often arises               before the Consumer Fora and               Commissions all over the country it               will be more appropriate if the               conflict    is   resolved    by     an               authoritative    judgment.     Further               since the conflict is between               Benches comprising three Judges               we deem it fit to refer these appeals               to a five­Judge Bench to resolve the               conflict once and for all. While we do               so we are mindful of the fact that in               the ordinary course a two­Judge               Bench ought to make a reference to               a three­Judge Bench in the first               place but in the facts and               circumstances of the case and               keeping in view the fact that the               conflict is between coordinate               Benches comprising three Judges a               reference to three Judges may not               suffice.”     4.        The other question has been referred by another  Division Bench of this Court by an Order dated 18.01.2017  passed in this very appeal being Civil Appeal No(s).10941­10942  of 2013, NIA Vs. Hilli Multipurpose Cold Storage Pvt. Ltd, the  relevant portion of the judgment is as under:                                                                  7                 “……….what is the commencing                point of the limitation of 30 days                stipulated in Section 13 of the Act is                required      to      be      decided                authoritatively.   The     declaration                made in JJ Merchant’s case that the                said period is to be reckoned from                the date of the receipt of the notice                by the opposite party or complaint                under the Act requires in our humble                opinion, a more critical analysis.”   5.        We have heard the learned Counsel for the parties at  length and have carefully gone through the records.   6.        In the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the  Consumer Protection Act, in paragraph 4, it has been specifically  provided that the Consumer Protection Act is “To provide speedy  and simple redressal to consumer disputes, a quasi­judicial  machinery is sought to be set up at the district, State and Central  levels…….”. The Preamble of the Consumer Protection Act also  mentions that the Act is “to provide for better protection of the  interests of the consumers”.   The nomenclature of this Act also  goes to show that it is for the benefit or protection of the  consumer. From the above, it is evident that the Consumer  Protection Act has been enacted to provide for expeditious                                                               8  disposal of consumer disputes and that, it is for the protection  and benefit of the consumer.   7.        Before we proceed to analyse and determine the  questions referred, we may, for ready reference, reproduce the  relevant provisions of the Consumer Protection Act and its  Regulations.                  “Section 13.

(2) Notwithstanding     anything contained in sub­section (1), a complaint may be entertained after the period specified in sub­section    (1),    if    the complainant     satisfies    the District   Forum,    the   State Commission or the National Commission, as the case may be, that he had sufficient cause                                                         14               for not filing the complaint              within such period:                    Provided    that   no   such              complaint shall be entertained              unless the National Commission,              the State Commission or the              District Forum, as the case may be,              records its reasons for condoning              such delay.”                              (emphasis supplied)    Relevant Provisions of the Consumer Protection Regulations,  2005 are reproduced below:                “Reg.­10. Issue of notice.­(1)              Whenever the Consumer Forum              directs the issuance of a notice in              respect of a complaint, appeal or              revision petition, as the case may              be,        to      the      opposite              party(ies)/respondent(s),              ordinarily such notice shall be              issued for a period of 30 days              and      depending      upon    the              circumstances of each case              even for less than 30 days.              (2) When there is a question of              raising presumption of service, 30              days notice shall be required.

(4)     Whenever appointing the              courier for the purpose of effecting                                          15  service, security deposit may also be taken. (5)    Along with the notice, copies     of    the   complaint, memorandum of grounds of appeal, petitions as the case may be and other documents filed shall be served upon the opposite party(ies)/respondent(s). (6)   After the opposite party or respondent has put in appearance, no application or document shall be received by the Registrar unless it bears an endorsement that a copy thereof has been served upon the other side.”   Reg.­14. Limitation. (1) Subject to the provisions of sections 15, 19 and 24A, the period of limitation in the following matters shall be as follows:­ (i)    Revision Petition shall be filed within 90 days from the date of the order or the date of receipt of the order as the case may be; (ii)   Application for setting aside the ex parte order under section 22A or dismissal of the complaint in default shall be maintainable if filed within thirty days from the date of the order or date of receipt of the order, as the case may be; (iii)  An application for review under sub­section (2) of section 22 shall be filed to the National Commission within 30 days from                                         16  the date of the order or receipt of the order, as the case may be; (iv)   The period of limitation for filing any application for which no period of limitation has been specified in the Act, the rules of these regulations shall be thirty days from the date of the cause of action or the date of knowledge.

(6)………………..”                 (emphasis supplied)                                                                    17  Question No. 1:      Whether the District Forum has power to                       extend the time for filing of response to                       the complaint beyond the period of 15                       days, in addition to 30 days, as envisaged                       under Section 13(2)(a) of the Consumer                       Protection Act?   8.         A bare reading of Section 13(2)(a) of the Act makes it  clear that the copy of the complaint which is to be sent to the  opposite party, is to be with the direction to give his version of (or  response to) the case (or complaint) within a period of 30 days. It  further provides that such period of 30 days can be extended by  the District Forum, but not beyond 15 days.   9.         Sub­Section 2(b)(i) of Section 13 of the Act provides for  a complaint to be decided on the basis of the response by the  opposite party and the evidence of the complainant and the  opposite party, where allegations contained in the complaint are  denied or disputed by the opposite party. Sub­Section 2(b)(ii) of  Section 13 of the Act provides that where no response is filed by  the opposite party, the complaint may be decided ex parte on the  basis of evidence brought forth by the complainant.                                                                  18  10.       Sub­Section 2(c) of Section 13 of the Consumer  Protection Act further provides that where the complainant fails  to appear on the date of hearing before the District Forum, the  District Forum may either dismiss the complaint for default or  decide it on merits. The aforesaid provision [sub­Section 2(c)] was  inserted by Act 62 of 2002, w.e.f. 15.03.2003. Similarly, Section  (3A) of Section 13 of the Consumer Protection Act, which was also  inserted by Act 62 of 2002, provides for deciding every complaint  as expeditiously as possible and endeavour       shall be made to  decide the complaint within a period of three months from the  receipt of notice by the opposite party, and within five months, if  the complaint requires analysis or testing of commodities. It also  provides that no adjournment shall ordinarily be granted by the  District Forum, and if the same is to be granted, costs may be  imposed, and further that reasons be recorded if the complaint is  disposed of after the time so provided.   11.       From the above, it is clear that as mentioned in the  Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Consumer Protection  Act, the District Forum is to provide speedy disposal of consumer  disputes. The same has been further reiterated by the legislature  by insertion of Section 13(2)(c) and 13(3A) by Act 62 of 2002.                                                                   19  12.          Section 13 of the Consumer Protection Act clearly  contemplates where time can be extended by the District Forum,  and where it is not to be extended. Like, under sub­Section (3A)  of Section 13, despite the best efforts of the District Forum, in  situations where the complaint cannot be decided within the  period specified therein, the same can be decided beyond the  specified period for reasons to be recorded in writing by the  District Forum at the time of disposing of the complaint. Meaning  thereby that the same would not be mandatory, but only  directory.    The phrase “endeavour shall be made”, makes the  intention of the legislature evident that the District Forum is to  make every effort to decide the case expeditiously within time, but  the same can also be decided beyond the said period, but for  reasons to be recorded.   13.          On the contrary, sub­Section (2)(a) of Section 13 of the  Consumer Protection Act provides for the opposite party to give  his response ‘within a period of 30 days or such extended period  not exceeding 15 days as may be granted by the District Forum’.  The intention of the legislature seems to be very clear that the  opposite party would get the time of 30 days, and in addition  another 15 days at the discretion of the Forum to file its                                                                 20  response. No further discretion of granting time beyond 45 days  is intended under the Act.            The question of natural justice is dealt with by the  legislature in sub­Section (3) of Section 13 of the Consumer  Protection Act, which clearly provides that “No proceedings  complying with the procedure laid down in the sub­Section (1) and  (2) shall be called in question in any court on the ground that the  principles of natural justice have not been complied with.”    The  legislature was conscious that the complaint would result in  being decided ex parte, or without the response of the opposite  party, if not filed within such time as provided under the  Consumer Protection Act, and in such a case, the opposite party  will not be allowed to take the plea that he was not given  sufficient time or that principles of natural justice were not  complied with.    Any other interpretation would defeat the very  purpose of sub­Section (3) of Section 13 of the Consumer  Protection Act.   14.       The maximum period of 45 days, as provided under the  Consumer Protection Act, would not mean that the complainant  has a right to always avail such maximum period of 45 days to  file its response.   Regulation 10 of the Consumer Protection                                                                     21  Regulations, 2005 clearly provides that ordinarily such notice to  the opposite party to file its response shall be issued for a period  of 30 days, but the same can be even less than 30 days,  depending upon the circumstances of each case.   15.        Now, reverting back to the provisions of the Consumer  Protection Act to consider as to whether the provision of sub­  Section 2(a) of Section 13 granting a maximum period of 15 days  in addition to 30 days has to be read as mandatory or not, we  may also consider the other provisions of the Consumer  Protection Act where the legislature intended to allow extension of  period of limitation.        Section 15 of the Consumer Protection Act provides for filing  of an appeal from the order of the District Forum to the State  Commission within a period of 30 days.          However, it leaves a  discretion with the State Commission to entertain an appeal filed  after the expiry of the said period of 30 days, if it is satisfied that  there was sufficient cause for not filing it within the stipulated  period. Similarly, discretion for filing an appeal before the  National Commission beyond the period of 30 days has also been  provided under Section 19 of the Consumer Protection Act.                                                                    22        Section 24A provides for the limitation period of 2 years for  filing the complaint.     However, sub­Section (2) of Section 24A  gives a discretion to entertain a complaint even after the period of  2 years, if there is a satisfactory cause for not filing the complaint  within such period, which has to be recorded in writing.  16.        Regulation 14 of the Consumer Protection Regulations,  2005 also deals with limitation. In addition, the same provides for  limitation while dealing with appeals (under Section 15 and 19)  and complaint (under Section 24A).           Sub­Regulation (2) of  Regulation 14 provides for condonation of delay for sufficient  reasons to be recorded.  17.        The legislature in its wisdom has provided for filing of  complaint or appeals beyond the period specified under the  relevant provisions of the Act and Regulations, if there is  sufficient cause given by the party, which has to be to the  satisfaction of the concerned authority. No such discretion has  been provided for under Section 13(2)(a) of the Consumer  Protection Act for filing a response to the complaint beyond the  extended period of 45 days (30 days plus 15 days).          Had the  legislature not wanted to make such provision mandatory but  only directory, the provision for further extension of the period for                                                                       23  filing the response beyond 45 days would have been provided, as  has been provided for in the cases of filing of complaint and  appeals. To carve out an exception in a specific provision of the  statute is not within the jurisdiction of the Courts, and if it is so  done, it would amount to legislating or inserting a provision into  the statute, which is not permissible.             By specifically enacting a provision under sub­Section  (3) of Section 13, with a specific clarification that violation of the  principles of natural justice shall not be called in question where  the procedure prescribed under sub­Sections (1) and (2) of  Section 13 of the Consumer Protection Act has been followed or  complied with, the intention of the legislature is clear that mere  denial of further extension of time for filing the response (by the  opposite party) would not amount to denial or violation of the  principles of natural justice. This provision of Section 13(3)  reinforces the time limit specified in Section 13(2)(a) of the Act.  18.        This Court in the case of Lachmi Narain vs Union of  India (1976) 2 SCC 953 has held that “if the provision is couched  in prohibitive or negative language, it can rarely be directory, the  use of peremptory language in a negative form is per se indicative  of the interest that the provision is to be mandatory”.      Further,                                                                  24  hardship cannot be a ground for changing the mandatory nature  of the statute, as "

The appellant was tried with 4 others and was            convicted under Sections 394, 460 and 302 read with             Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (hereinafter             referred to as, ‘the IPC’, for short). He was also             found guilty of offences under Sections 11 and 13 of             the Madhya Pradesh Dakaiti Avam Vyapharan Adhiniyam,             1981          (hereinafter   referred   to   as,    ‘Madhya   Pradesh             Adhiniyam’). The appellant was, in fact, sentenced to             death for the offence under Section 302 read with Signature Not Verified  Digitally signed by GULSHAN KUMAR              Section 34 of the IPC along with two other accused ARORA Date: 2020.05.29 16:57:08 IST Reason:                apart from a fine of Rs. 5000/-. He was sentenced to                                                1 10 years Rigorous Imprisonment in regard to the offence  under Section 460 of the IPC. He was also handed down  a sentence of 10 years for the offence under Section  394 read with Section 34 of the IPC. Still further, he  was also sentenced to 7 years for the offence under  Sections 11 and 13 of the Madhya Pradesh Adhiniyam. By  the impugned judgment, the High Court answered the  death reference by holding that in the circumstances,  the death penalty was not warranted. In place of death  penalty, the High Court sentenced the appellant and two  other accused to life imprisonment and enhanced the  fine to Rs. 25,000/-. The appeal filed by the appellant  was   dismissed   otherwise.    The   prosecution    case,   in  brief, appears to be as follows:           On   08.09.2008,      in   the   night,    Bharosilal           (hereinafter referred to as, ‘the deceased’,           for short) was at his village Bilaua. He was           residing alone. One Abhay Sharma-PW9, who is           the son of the deceased, was informed by one           Neeraj Bhargav that his father has not opened           the door on that day.            On receiving such           information, PW9, who also turned out to be                                 2         the complainant, finally went to his father’s          residence and it was found that his father was          dead and the First Information Report (FIR)          was lodged on 10.09.2008. On the basis of the          investigation conducted, Kalli, Hariom, Veeru,          Virendra and the appellant came to be charged          with the offences as noticed. In fact, the          appellant was charged under Section 397 of the          IPC also.   2. PW1 to PW15 were examined as prosecution witnesses. Material objects were also produced. The following are  the questions, which were framed by the Trial Court:        “(i) Whether accused Kalli @ Gopal Sharma,            Sonu @ Sunil and Hariom on the date of            incident after sunset and before            sunrise after committing house tress            pass in the residential house of            deceased Bharosilal, committed the            murder of Bharosilal?       (ii) Whether accused Kalli @ Gopal Sharma,            Sonu @ Sunil and Hariom formed common            intention   to   commit   murder   of            Bharosilal?       (iii) Whether accused Kalli @ Gopal Sharma,            Hariom and Sonu @ Sunil in fulfilment            of their common intention committed            murder of Bharosilal by strangulation            and cutting by a chhuri (knife)?                              3       (iv) Whether accused Kalli @ Gopal Sharma,            Hariom and Sonu @ Sunil by using            deadly weapon in committing robbery,            committed the murder of Bharosilal and            looted gold and silver jewellery and            two mobile phones of Nokia made from            the possession of Bharosilal?       (v) Whether accused Veeru and Virendera           along with accused Kalli @ Gopal           Sharma, Hariom and Sonu @ Sunil, at           the house of accused Virendra Singh,           Kushmah    hatched   conspiracy   of           committing robbery in the house of           Bharosilal?       (vi) Whether the accused persons committed            the offence defined and specified            under Section 2(b) of MPDVPK Act and            committed the offence u/s 11/13 of the            above said Act?”   3. The Trial Court found that it was a case entirely based on circumstantial evidence. It noticed that the  deceased had suffered the following injuries:        “Injury No.1   Incised of 6x1.5x1 c.m. on                      the right side of the chin.       Injury No. 2   Incised wound of 4 x 1 ½ cm                      below 1 cm from the injury                      no. 1.       Injury No. 3   Incised wound of 6 x 3 x 2cm                      left fore arm anteriority                      middle.       Injury No. 4   Incised wound of 6 x 1 x 1cm,                      just 2cm below injury no. 3.       Injury No. 5   Incised wound of 6 x 1 x 1cm,                      just 2cm below injury no. 4.                             4        Injury No. 6        Incised wound on abdomen 3”                            below measuring 3 x 2 x deep                            upto peritoneum, part of                            intestine coming out from                            the wound.”   4. The cause of death was found to be shock and hemorrhage      due   to   excessive    bleeding    caused     by  multiple wounds. The death was caused within 36 hours  of the postmortem report. The postmortem was conducted  on 10.09.2008. It cannot be disputed that the death  was homicidal and it was caused with the intent to  commit murder. The Trial Court further proceeded to  find that the certain articles were found missing from  the almirah in the house where the deceased stayed.  PW8 is wife of the deceased. PW9, as already noticed,  is   one   of   the   sons   of   the   deceased.   PW13     held  identification of the gold and silver jewellery and  the mobile phones, which according to them, belonged  to   the   deceased.       The    identified   articles      were  belonging to the deceased. One hasli (necklace) made  of silver, one pair of earrings and two mobile phones  were identified. The contention of the accused that  PW13, who held the identification proceedings, deposed  that at that time a Police Officer was present, was                                    5 rejected by finding that from the Identification Memo-  Exhibit P21, it was clear that no Police Officer was  present at the time of the identification of the  proceedings. The Court also relied upon the evidence  of PW8 and PW9, who were found to have not stated about  the presence of Police Officers at the time of the  identification proceedings. The evidence of PW9 and  the evidence of PW8, were also referred to, to find  that the Police came to open the door. It was opened  and   it   was   seen   that   the   almirah   was   opened   and  goods/gold articles were scattered, and out of the  said goods, one hasli (necklace) made of silver, one  pair of gold earrings and two mobile phones, were  missing. The evidence of PW3-another son, was relied  upon to find that PW5 had overheard the conversation  between all the accused which was to the effect that  the deceased was living alone and they were making a  plan for committing a loot in his house. No doubt, the  Court also noticed that PW1, who was cited by the  prosecution, to prove the said conversation, turned  hostile. PW3 had also deposed that he was told by PW5  about having overheard the conversation between the                                   6 accused. The evidence of PW3 was relied upon to find  that both Virendra and Veeru used to come to massage  the body of his father and his father used to say that  they would be got employed. PW3 deposed about his  familiarity with accused Virendra, Veeru and Kalli  present in the Court. PW6- another son of the deceased,  has deposed that Kalli used to come to his village to  sell ghee and used to sit and talk with the deceased  and used to massage the body of his father. The Trial  court finds that Veeru, Virendra and Kalli used to  come and they were also acquainted with the deceased  and his family members. Thereafter, the Trial Court  also referred to the recoveries of the articles. From  Hariom, one mobile phone was recovered. From Kalli,  the Chhuri(knife), used for committing the offence,  was   recovered.   From   the   appellant,   another   mobile  phone of Nokia Company, Model 5110, of black colour,  upon which the Number 97321820 was written in red ink,  was also seized. The evidence of PW9 was relied upon  wherein he has deposed, that a Nokia Mobile on which  B.L. in English was written with red marker, and on  the battery of the same, Number 97321820 in red ink,                                   7 had been written, was stolen. From accused Virendra,  the recovery of hasli(necklace) was effected. From  Veeru, one pair of gold earrings was seized. On the  basis   of   the    same,    it    was       found    that    the    stolen  property and weapon have been seized on the statement  of   the     accused,       and    that       these     circumstances,  completed     the    chain        of       circumstantial      evidence.  Reliance was placed on the deposition by PW5, who had  overheard the conversation between the accused about  the criminal conspiracy. PW7, a witness to the recovery  statement     of    the     appellant-Exhibit           P13    and     also  evidence of PW12- the Police Inspector, who arrested  the appellant, has been relied upon to prove the  statement leading to the recovery of the mobile from  the appellant. The following findings may be noted:              “In the above said analysis it is         proved that there is criminal conspiracy         amongst the accused persons to commit         theft or loot in the house of deceased,         on the basis of memorandum statement of         accused Hariom, the looted mobile is         recovered/ seized from the possession of         accused Hariom on the basis of memorandum         of accused Kalli @ Gopal Sharma and on         producing by him one blood stained sharp         edged chhuri (knife) used in the offence         has been seized from the possession of         accused Kalli @ Gopal Sharma. On the basis                                         8 of memorandum statement of accused Sonu @ Sunil and on producing by him the looted mobile Nokia is seized from accused Sonu @ Sunil. In the same manner on the basis of Accused Virendra one old and used hasli (necklace) made of silver is seized from the possession of accused Virendra. On the basis of accused Veeru and on producing by him the looted property i.e. one pair of earrings are seized by the police from the possession of accused Veeru. All the four looted properties i.e. two mobile phones, one hasli (necklace) and one pair of gold earrings have been identified by Rukmani (PW-8) and   Abhay   Kumar   Sharma    (PW-9)   in identification    proceedings    and   they admitted that the same belong to them. All these circumstances complete the chain   of   circumstances    against   the accused persons. The accused persons have not produced any evidence in rebuttal of the same. The defence did not explain the fact that the looted property and weapon of offence have been recovered from their possession in this situation it is clear that.   The   accused    persons    hatched criminal conspiracy of committing loot in the house of the deceased, accused Kalli @ Gopal Sharma, Hariom and Sonu @ Sunil has committed murder of deceased before sun rises and after sun set by entering in the house of the deceased.     From the criminal conspiracy and in fulfillment of the same and from the seizure of weapon of offence and looted property from the accused Kalli @ Gopal Sharma, Hariom, Sonu @ Sunil and no explanation of the same on behalf of defence it would be presumed that accused Kalli @ Gopal, Sonu @ Sunil and Hariom by entering in the house of deceased before sun rise and after sun set has committed                      9       loot and in committing of the said loot       has committed the murder of deceased       Bharosilal Sharma by inflicting injuries       with knife. Because at the time of       committing loot all the three accused       persons Kalli @ Gopal, Hariom and Sonu @       Sunil were present at the place of       occurrence, all the three have also       committed loot and in committing of the       said   loot  the   murder   of   deceased       Bharosilal has been committed, from this       it is clearly concluded that there were       common intention amongst the accused       persons Kalli @ Gopal, Hariom and Sonu @       Sunil to commit the murder of deceased       Bharosilal.   Therefore,    the   offence       u/s460/302/34 against accused Kalli @       Gopal, Hariom and Sonu @ Sunil are proved       beyond reasonable doubt.           So far as the question of offence u/s       397/34 IPC against accused Kalli @ Gopal,       Hariom and Sonu @ Sunil is concerned the       weapon used in the offence knife is only       seized from accused Kalli @ Gopal Sharma,       it is clear from the same that at the time       of incident a chhuri, used in the incident       which is deadly and sharp edged was in       possession of accused Kalli @ Gopal       Sharma.”                               (Emphasis supplied)   5. The appellant was found along with Hariom, guilty of the offence under Section 394 read with Section 34  of the IPC, whereas, Section 397 of the IPC was found  proved against Kalli. The Trial Court found Kalli  guilty under Section 397 read with Section 34 of the  IPC. Appellant was also convicted under Section 302                           10 read with Section 34 of the IPC. Thereafter, it was  also found that the appellant and others were guilty  of the offences under Sections 11 and 13 of the Madhya  Pradesh    Adhiniyam,    based    on    the    offences   proved  otherwise.   6. The High Court, in appeal, proceeded to find that eleven circumstances emerged before the Trial Court:      i.     The incident in connection with the loot took        place on 08.09.2008 after locking the doors from        inside in the house of the deceased who was        residing alone.      ii. That the postmortem confirms the prosecution        case. It is found that it is natural that on        09.09.2008 when the deceased did not appear to        be seen and was not responding on knocking the        door, Neeraj Bhargava informed PW9 that he was        not responding. PW9 and PW8 departed to the        place to know about the welfare of the deceased.      iii.       Upon     request    of   PW9,    his   neighbor-        Phoolchand climbed through the stairs and he        found the deceased with blood on his hand and                                 11   was lying dead. He went to the Police Station    Bilaua for lodging the report which was recorded    at about 11:30 P.M in night. The dead body was    referred for postmortem on the same day and the    FIR was lodged in the evening of 10.09.2008.  iv. On 10.09.2008, Ashok Kumar(PW3), in his Case    Diary Statement, disclosed that the Cell Phone    Number 9406586386, generally used by his father,    was   also   found   missing.      Another      Cell    Phone    Number 9928120429, which was made available by    son of deceased, was also found missing.  v.   Investigation     was     conducted     by    PW15     and    initially    names   of     the   assailants     were    not    dictated by that time.  vi. The   successor      of     PW15-(PW14)        conducted    subsequent     investigation.            Statements       of    witnesses were recorded, call details of stolen    mobile sets from Cyber Cell was received. On    18.10.2008,    he    came    to   know    the    names    of    assailants from Cyber Cell. Within two days,    arrests were made of the accused, viz., Kalli,                            12   Hariom, Parihar, Virendra Kachhi and Veeru. The    Churri(knife) was seized from accused Kalli, one    necklace     from     Virendra,     one   pair     of    gold    earrings from Veeru.  vii.       The accused cannot get benefit for the    inaction/ latches of the investigation.  viii.      On 02.11.2008, D.P. Sharma-PW12, arrested    appellant and recovered from him one mobile    phone bearing SIM No. 97321820.  ix. As per medical evidence, it is clear that the    deceased was put to death by the accused or any    one    of   them.   Looking    to   the   nature    of   the    incised wounds seen on the body of the deceased,    the death appears to be homicidal.  x.     Identification     of    properties,    which       were    seized/     recovered    in    between    18.10.2008      to    02.11.2008, was conducted on 10.12.2008, which    cannot be said delayed because the persons who    have identified the articles, were the residents    of Gwalior.                               13       xi. The motive of the incident is apparently         clear.     It   was      committed     for   committing         loot/theft, and during the incident of theft,         the deceased was killed by the accused.    7. We have heard learned Senior Counsel for the appellant and also learned counsel for the state.  Learned Senior Counsel would complain that there is no  evidence against the appellant for convicting him for  the   offences,   he   has   been    found    guilty   of.    He  complained that the Court’s below have erred in placing  reliance   upon    PW-5   who     allegedly    overheard      the  conversation    between   the    five   accused     persons   by  standing outside the house of one of them. He points  out that the witness could not be believed. It is  pointed out that PW-1 who was cited by the prosecution  to prove the said conversation has not adhered to the  version which was sought to be attributed to him. It  is highly improbable that PW-5 could have overheard  any such conversation. He pointed out that a clear  discrepancy in regard to the recovery of the mobile  phone from the appellant. In the memorandum relating                                   14 the alleged recovery of the mobile phone, what is  stated is that the appellant took one mobile phone  make of Nokia of the deceased and he has hidden the  same on the roof of his house. The seizure memo reveals  the following as what was recovered:      “     S.No.   Property                       Signatures                                            obtained on                                            packets    or                                            property     1.      One mobile phone of Nokia             company of black colour old             and used, model No. 5110             made in Finland CE 0188X no.             490541/30/26305416        is             written. Code No. 0502182 is             written. B.L. is written on             the mobile in red ink and on             its battery a no. 97321820             is written with red ink.             (some       portion      not             illegible).                                                            “   8. He would then point out that the High Court, in the recital of circumstances, has found that a Cell  Phone Number 9928120429 was found missing, and then he  points out the eighth circumstance, which is noted by  the Court, is that one mobile phone, bearing SIM Number  97321820, was recovered from the appellant. Therefore,  the phone that was seized from the appellant was not                             15 the phone number which was mentioned by the son of the  deceased, PW-3, as was being used by his father. He  further pointed out about the mysterious maxi found at  the   premises.   In   this   regard,   we   may   notice   the  following findings by the Trial Court:              “It is argued on behalf of defence        that one blood stained and sleeveless        maxi of white colour having lines of brown        colour, the lower portion of the same is        blood stained and the same is used is        seized by the police wide Ex P-6 from the        place of occurrence, while there was no        woman present at the place of occurrence.        In such a situation, on account of seizure        of maxi from the place of occurrence, the        presence of any woman at the time of the        incident is proved, but who was that        woman, the prosecution did not produce        any evidence in this regard hence, the        prosecution    case  is   doubtful.   Only        recovery/ seizure of blood stained maxi        from the place of occurrence does not make        doubtful to the prosecution case. Human        blood was detected on the shirt of        deceased and on the said maxi, there is        no evidence that there was blood of any        other person on the maxi. Because the wife        of the deceased Rukmani Sharma is alive        and Rukmani Sharma (Pw-8) has admitted in        her cross examination that she used to go        occasionally to the house/ place of        occurrence at Bilaua. In this sitation        where there are visits of the wife of        deceased    in   the   house   then   this        probability could not be denied that the        said maxi would be of the wife of the        deceased. In this situation from the                                 16       seizure of maxi from place occurrence the       incident could not be doubtful.”   9. He would point out that the Investigating Officer admitted that he did not carry out any investigation  regarding the maxi. He would further contend that there  is no evidence, as far as the appellant is concerned,  to convict him of the offences. The evidence, even  according to the prosecution witnesses, show that the  other accused, viz., Veeru, Virendra and Kalli, were  known to the prosecution witnesses as persons who would  frequent the house of the deceased. As far as the  appellant is concerned, there is no such evidence. In  short, the contention is that the case is one where  the appellant is convicted without any evidence and  the injustice may be set right.   10. Per   contra,   learned    Counsel   for   the   State  supported the judgment.   11. As already noticed the appellant stands convicted under Section 460, 302 read with Section 34 of the IPC  and Section 394 read with Section 34 of the IPC. This  is besides convicting the appellant under Sections 13                             17 and 14 of the Madhya Pradesh Adhiniyam. The case hinges  entirely on circumstantial evidence. Though eleven  circumstances have been enlisted by the High Court,  the    circumstances    Nos.   2    and   3   relate    to   the  prosecution version as to the discovery of the death  of the deceased by his son and his wife. They relate  to going to the place of his residence, finding out  the dead body and the lodging of the FIR. Circumstance  No. 5 also does not amount to a circumstance. Equally,  we are not convinced that the circumstance No. 7, viz.,  that    the   accused    cannot     get   benefit      for   the  inaction/latches of the investigation, can amount to  a piece of circumstantial evidence for the prosecution  to discharge its burden to prove the case against the  accused.   12. The circumstances, which can be culled out, can be put as follows:                The deceased died in his house where            he was living alone, as a result of            shock and hemorrhage from 6 incised            wounds as noticed and proved by medical            evidence. The death is homicidal too.            There were valuable articles, namely, a            silver necklace, gold earring and two            mobile phones which were found missing            too. These articles have been recovered                                 18             from the accused as already mentioned.             A knife stood recovered from Kalli, one             of the accused. The other valuable             articles identified by the closed             relative, namely, his wife and his son             stood recovered. From the articles so             recovered,   one   mobile   phone   was             recovered from the appellant.   13. There is evidence of prosecution witnesses that out   of    the   five   accused,       viz.,   Kalli,    Veeru   and  Virendra used to frequent the house of the deceased.  The over hearing of the conversation by PW-5 amongst  the accused prior to the death of the deceased about  their plans to commit loot/theft from the house of the  deceased is another circumstance relied upon.  WHETHER A MOBILE PHONE WAS RECOVERED BASED ON STATEMENT BY APPELLANT   14. PW12     has    deposed      that    on     01.11.2008,     after  arresting the appellant and on enquiry in custody, he  (appellant) made Statement-P13 to the effect that the  looted mobile seized was hidden on the loft of his  room and he would recover the same. He further deposed  that appellant took the looted mobile from the loft  and    he     prepared     the      Seizure       Memo.    In     the  cross-examination, he states that the seized mobile                                   19 was   of   the    deceased.       He    further     stated    that    no  documents were produced. He denied that he had planted  the mobile from anywhere and false proceedings have  been done. PW7 has been examined to prove, inter alia,  that he was called to the Police Station, and after 15  to 20 days of the proceedings relating to the recovery  of the knife from Kalli, enquiry was made from the  person, who he has told was Sonu-appellant. On making  enquiry, he gave an information in respect of the  mobile.    He     deposed       that    he   has    signed     on    the  Statement-P13 [the Statement purportedly to be under  Section    27      of     the    Indian      Evidence    Act,       1872  (hereinafter referred to as, ‘the Evidence Act’, for  short)]. He also admits that he had signed on the  Seizure          Memo       prepared          based       on         the  Statement-P14.          Thus,   PW7    and   PW12     prove    that    a  statement was given by the appellant while in custody.  Based on the statement, a mobile phone was recovered  from the appellant. The recovery was from his house.  It was not from an open space.                                        20 WHETHER RECOVERED PHONE PROVED AS BELONGING TO THE DECEASED. EVIDENCE RELATED TO THE MOBILE PHONE, RECOVERED FROM THE APPELLANT  15. PW3-son of the deceased has this to say:             On 10.09.2008, his brother told him that some      persons had committed murder of his father causing      injuries with sharp-edged weapon and took away      goods/articles from the almirah.              Along with this,      they also took away two mobile phones of his      father.      The    mobile    phone     of    his   father     is      940655863866 which is of BSNL. The sim of the same      has been issued either from Dabra or Bilaua (We      are not concerned with this phone as this phone      has been recovered from another accused).            What is stated next is as follows:            The other phone bearing number 9920121429 make      of M-Nokia was fitted with square LKD Red LED which      had a light while charging the mobile. The mobile      was bought by him at Bombay prior to three months      ago   when    his    father      came   to    Bombay   so    that      information        about   him    could      be   communicated.                                    21 He, however, also says in his cross-examination  that he had stated in his statement to the Police  that when his father came to Bombay, then, he had  given him another phone of make Nokia which had  LED and showing light while charging the mobile.  The mobile number of the other phone was mentioned  in Exhibit D1. He is unable to explain as to why  if such statement is not found in the statement  given by him to the Police. He said that again he  is unable to give the reason as to why it is not  mentioned in the statement to the Police that he  had stated that the father had two sims out of  which one was of Vodafone which was purchased from  Bombay. Lastly, he states in further cross as  follows:-     “Cross-examination by Sh. A.K. Shrotiya,   Advocate for Sunu@Sunil.    I could not tell the date on which I had   given mobile phone to my father the above   said mobile I had purchased from Mahesh   Gahera, Mahesh Gahera is residing Bombay   he lived at Bandra the same was given in   gift the EMI of the same. I could not tell   today I can not produce a receipt of the   same as I was given the above said mobile   as gift to me by Mahesh Gahera, he deals   in mobile phone he as several sets of the                       22       same. My father had another mobile phone       made of Nokia EMI no of the same I would       not tell I neither have receipt of the       same nor I could produce the same.”   16. PW9 is another son of the deceased, who has identified the mobile phones. This is what he has to  say in regard to the mobile phones:          The mobiles were of black colour and having      old antenna. On the battery of one mobile A-      9406586386 is written in red ink and on the other      mobile on the back side it is written capital ‘BL’,      in English and number 97321820 was written with      red marker. He says that after 8 to 10 days, when      they checked the goods, they came to know that      some articles had been stolen. He further states      that they had informed the Police by that day about      the theft of the mobiles. He and his mother went      to identify the goods. His mother was called first      and he went later.      It is to be remembered that PW3 says he had given  the mobile in question prior to 3 months ago when  deceased came to Bombay. The deceased was staying                              23 alone. It is PW9 now who has identified by the number  written in the battery.     17. PW8 is the mother. She says first, on the next day, Police Officer came and they opened the room and  they saw that almirah was opened and articles were  scattered. Out of the articles, one hensli (necklace  made of silver), gold earrings and two mobile phones  of Nokia Company, were stolen. Except this, no article  was   stolen.   She   says   that   identification   of   the  articles was got done by her. In cross-examination on  behalf of Kali alias Gopal, she says that on 11th or  12th, she came to know about the articles which were  stolen. She says that in her statement to the Police,  she has stated that on the next day of incident, the  almirah was opened and the articles were scattered  and, then, she came to know that her goods had been  stolen. She had not made any complaint anywhere in  respect of her stolen goods. She denies allegation  that they have concocted a false story of goods being  stolen after 8 to 10 days of the incident for creating                                 24 evidence. In this regard, it may be noticed that in  the evidence of PW9-son, he has stated that after going  to the lower room on the next day, he saw the almirah  on that day. Articles were lying outside. Therefore,  they guessed that something had been stolen. At that  time, it could not be known what had been stolen. After  8 to 10 days, when they checked the goods, they came  to know that some articles had been stolen.  "

This judgment decides the reference to three Judges made                           vide order dated 28th February, 2019 in Civil Appeal No. 2402 of                           2019 titled Vidya Drolia and Others v. Durga Trading                           Corporation,1 as it doubts the legal ratio expressed in Himangni                           Enterprises v. Kamaljeet Singh Ahluwalia2 that landlord-tenant                           disputes governed by the provisions of the Transfer of Property Signature Not Verified  Digitally signed by SATISH KUMAR YADAV Date: 2020.12.14 19:38:59 IST Reason:              1 2019 SCC OnLine SC 358          2 (2017) 10 SCC 706                                                       1      Act, 1882, are not arbitrable as this would be contrary to public       policy.    2.   A deeper consideration of the order of reference reveals that the       issues required to be answered relate to two aspects that are       distinct and yet interconnected, namely:          (i)    meaning of non-arbitrability and when the subject matter of                 the dispute is not capable of being resolved through                 arbitration; and          (ii) the conundrum – “who decides” – whether the court at the                 reference stage or the arbitral tribunal in the arbitration                 proceedings would decide the question of non-arbitrability.                The second aspect also relates to the scope and ambit of        jurisdiction of the court at the referral stage when an objection of        non-arbitrability is raised to an application under Section 8 or 11        of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (for short, the        ‘Arbitration Act’).   3.   We are not reproducing and examining the factual matrix, as we       are only answering the legal issues raised. However, we would       refer, in brief, to the legal reasoning and the ratio in Himangni                                        2        Enterprises and the counter view expressed in the order of         reference in Vidya Drolia.  4.     Himangni Enterprises upheld the decision of the High Court and         the District Court rejecting the application filed by the defendant-         tenant under Section 8 of the Arbitration Act in a civil suit seeking         its eviction from a shop in a commercial complex in New Delhi. The         suit was also for the recovery of arrears of rent and permanent         injunction. The tenancy in question was not protected under the         rent control legislation and the rights and obligations were         governed by the Transfer of Property Act. Two Judges of this         Court held that the issue of non-arbitrability is no longer res integra         as it stood answered by decisions in Natraj Studios (P) Ltd. v.         Navrang Studios3 and Booz Allen & Hamilton Inc. v. SBI Home         Finance Ltd.4 In Natraj Studios (P) Ltd., wherein an application         under Section 8 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 was dismissed as the         tenancy was protected under the Bombay Rents, Hotel and         Lodging Houses Rates Control Act, 1947, it was observed that on         broader consideration of public policy, the arbitrator lacked         jurisdiction to decide the question whether the licensee-landlord         was entitled to seek possession. The dispute could be exclusively  3 (1981) 1 SCC 523 4 (2011) 5 SCC 532: (2011) 2 SCC (Civ) 781                                               3      decided by the Court of Small Causes, which alone had       jurisdiction. In Booz Allen & Hamilton Inc., it was held that in       eviction or tenancy matters governed by special statutes and       where the tenant enjoys statutory protection, only the specified       court has been conferred jurisdiction. Himangni Enterprises       relying on the said ratios holds that though the Delhi Rent Act is       not applicable, it does not follow that the Arbitration Act would be       applicable so as to confer jurisdiction on the arbitrator. Even in       cases of tenancies governed by the Transfer of Property Act, the       dispute would be triable by the civil court and not by the arbitrator.       The exemption from the applicability of the Rent Act could be       withdrawn and thereupon the rights would be governed by the rent       control legislation.   5.   In Vidya Drolia, another division bench referring to Section 11(6-       A) has observed that the referral stage requirement is to only       examine ‘existence of an arbitration agreement’ and not validity of       the arbitration agreement. 246th Report of the Law Commission of       India had suggested twin examination whether the agreement       ‘exists’ or is ‘null and void’, albeit the Section 11(6-A), as enacted,       requires ‘existence of an arbitration agreement’, and the                                       4        prerequisite that the arbitration agreement should not be ‘null and         void’ was deliberately omitted. The wording of Section 11(6-A) was         contrasted with Section 16(1) to draw distinction between ‘validity         of an arbitration agreement’ and ‘existence of an arbitration         agreement’.     Reference was made to observations of Kurian         Joseph, J. in Duro Felguera, S.A v. Gangavaram Port Limited,5         to the effect that the scope of Section 11(6-A) is limited, only to see         whether an arbitration agreement exists – nothing more, nothing         less. The legislative policy and purpose are to essentially minimize         judicial intervention at the appointment stage. Referring to Sections         111, 114 and 114A of the Transfer of Property Act, it is observed         that there is nothing in this Act and law to show that a dispute         relating to the determination of lease, arrears of rent etc. cannot be         decided by an arbitrator. The grounds predicated on public policy         could be raised before the arbitrator as they could be raised before         the court. The arbitrator could well abide by the provisions of         Sections 114 and 114A, and apply the public policy considerations         for the protection of tenants as a class. Referring to Booz Allen &         Hamilton Inc., it was observed that the right in rem is a right         exercisable against the world at large and is not amenable to   5 (2017) 9 SCC 729                                        5        arbitration, whereas in case of rights in personam an interest is         protected against a specific individual, and is referable to         arbitration. Further, subordinate rights in personam arising from         rights in rem have always been considered to be arbitrable.         Decision in Natraj Studios (P) Ltd. was distinguishable, as the         rent control legislation being applicable, the tenancy disputes were         to be exclusively decided by the small cause court in Bombay. The         legislation had provided that no other court would have jurisdiction         to entertain any suit, proceedings or deal with such claim or         questions. The exception in the form of non-arbitrable landlord-         tenant disputes, as per Booz Allen & Hamilton Inc., was confined         only to those cases/matters governed by: (i) special statues, (ii)         where the tenant enjoys statutory protection and (iii) where only         specific courts are conferred jurisdiction to decide disputes.         Transfer of Property Act does not negate arbitrability. In Olympus         Superstructures Pvt. Ltd. v. Meena Vijay Khetan and Others,6 it         was held that there is no prohibition in the Specific Relief Act, 1963         for referring disputes relating to specific performance of contracts         to arbitration. Equally, the discretion to refuse or grant specific         performance would not militate against arbitrability. Reference was   6 (1999) 5 SCC 651                                        6        made to Vimal Kishor Shah and Others v. Jayesh Dinesh Shah         and Other,7 which had referred to Dhulabhai Etc. v. State of         Madhya Pradesh and Another,8 in the context of whether the         disputes under the Indian Trusts Act, 1882 were arbitrable. The         disputes under the Trusts Act were held to be non-arbitrable by         necessary implication, as the Trusts Act had conferred specific         powers on the principal judge of the civil court, which powers an         arbitrator could not exercise. The judgment in Vimal Kishor Shah         was followed by another Division Bench in Emaar MGF Land         Limited v. Aftab Singh,9 a case relating to the Consumer         Protection Act, 1986. Reasoning that the exemption from rent         control legislation can be withdrawn and thereupon Arbitration Act         would not apply, it was observed, was not a valid justification and         ground to hold that the subject matter was not arbitrable.   6.     Learned counsel for the parties have primarily relied upon the         reasoning given in Himangni Enterprises and Vidya Drolia and         have referred to other case law which we would subsequently         examine. To avoid prolixity and repetition, we are not reproducing         the respective contentions and arguments, as the same would be  7 (2016) 8 SCC 788 8 (1968) 3 SCR 662 9 (2019) 12 SCC 751                                       7      dealt with and appreciated during the course of our reasoning.       However, we acknowledge that the oral submissions and       compilations have been of immense help. Similarly, scholarly       writings in books and articles expressing diverse views on non-       arbitrability and Who Decides Non-arbitrability have facilitated us       unclog the legal and jurisprudential nuances and contradictions to       try and resolve the issues in the context of domestic law of       arbitration in India.    7.   At the outset we begin with the caveat that this judgment does not       examine and interpret the transnational provisions of arbitration in       Part II of the Arbitration Act.   Non-Arbitrability  8.   Non-arbitrability is basic for arbitration as it relates to the very       jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal. An arbitral tribunal may lack       jurisdiction for several reasons. Non-arbitrability has multiple       meanings. Booz Allen & Hamilton Inc. refers to three facets of       non-arbitrability, namely: -                “(i) Whether the disputes are capable of adjudication               and settlement by arbitration? That is, whether the               disputes, having regard to their nature, could be               resolved by a private forum chosen by the parties (the               Arbitral Tribunal) or whether they would exclusively               fall within the domain of public fora (courts).                                        8                    (ii) Whether the disputes are covered by the                    arbitration agreement? That is, whether the disputes                    are enumerated or described in the arbitration                    agreement as matters to be decided by arbitration or                    whether the disputes fall under the “excepted matters”                    excluded from the purview of the arbitration                    agreement.                     (iii) Whether the parties have referred the disputes to                    arbitration? That is, whether the disputes fall under                    the scope of the submission to the Arbitral Tribunal, or                    whether they do not arise out of the statement of                    claim and the counterclaim filed before the Arbitral                    Tribunal. A dispute, even if it is capable of being                    decided by arbitration and falling within the scope of                    an arbitration agreement, will not be “arbitrable” if it is                    not enumerated in the joint list of disputes referred to                    arbitration, or in the absence of such a joint list of                    disputes, does not form part of the disputes raised in                    the pleadings before the Arbitral Tribunal.”                 John J. Barcelo III, in his paper titled ‘Who Decides the         Arbitrator’s         Jurisdiction?         Separability         and       Competence-         Competence in Transnational Perspective’,10 in the context of         transnational commercial transactions, has divided facets relating         to non-arbitrability into seven categories:                     “Stage 1# is crucial concerning whether arbitration is                    allowed to go forward efficaciously or is obstructed by                    court intervention. At Stage 1, a party opposing                    arbitration may raise any of a series of legal issues                    requiring court, rather than arbitrator, decision. These                    may include any or all of the following claims: (1) the                    container contract is invalid (for a reason that would not                    directly invalidate the arbitration clause); (2) no                    arbitration agreement came into existence between the                    parties; (3) an existing arbitration agreement is either  10 Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law, vol. 36, no.4, October 2003, p. 1115-1136                                                   9              formally invalid (for example, not in writing) or materially              invalid (for example, violative of mandatory law); (4) a              disputed issue is not within the scope of the arbitration              agreement; (5) mandatory law prohibits a disputed              issue, though within the scope of the parties’ arbitration              agreement, to be arbitrated (a special type of material              invalidity respecting a specific issue fraught with public              policy concerns, such as (formerly) antitrust or              securities fraud); (6) some precondition for permissible              arbitration has not been met (for example, a time-limit              on initiating arbitration); (7) the party seeking arbitration              has waived its right to arbitrate or is estopped from              claiming that right.”              (#Stage 1 is the referral stage.)   9.   Validity of the legal ratio in Himangni Enterprises cannot be       decided without examining when a subject matter or dispute is       non-arbitrable. Understanding of the different facets of non-       arbitrability is important as it would help us appreciate the       consequences. This would assist in deciding whether the court or       the arbitral tribunal has the jurisdiction to decide the particular facet       of non-arbitrability. The jurisdiction could well depend on the nature       and type of the non-arbitrability alleged. The order of reference in       Vidya Drolia draws distinction for the purpose of exercise of       jurisdiction between non-arbitrability on account of existence and       non-arbitrability on account of the validity of an arbitration       agreement.                                           10 10.   Arbitration is a private dispute resolution mechanism whereby two        or more parties agree to resolve their current or future disputes by        an arbitral tribunal, as an alternative to adjudication by the courts        or a public forum established by law. Parties by mutual agreement        forgo their right in law to have their disputes adjudicated in the        courts/public forum. Arbitration agreement gives contractual        authority to the arbitral tribunal to adjudicate the disputes and bind        the parties. The expression ‘arbitration agreement’ has been        defined in clause (d) of sub-section (2) to mean an agreement as        defined in Section 7 of the Arbitration Act. Section 7 of the        Arbitration Act reads:                “7. Arbitration agreement. — (1) In this Part,               “arbitration agreement” means an agreement by the               parties to submit to arbitration all or certain disputes               which have arisen or which may arise between them               in respect of a defined legal relationship, whether               contractual or not.                (2) An arbitration agreement may be in the form of an               arbitration clause in a contract or in the form of a               separate agreement.                (3) An arbitration agreement shall be in writing.                (4) An arbitration agreement is in writing if it is               contained in—                  (a) a document signed by the parties;                                           11                       (b) an exchange of letters, telex, telegrams or                       other means of telecommunication which provide                       a record of the agreement; or                        (c) an exchange of statements of claim and                       defense in which the existence of the agreement                       is alleged by one party and not denied by the                       other.                     (5) The reference in a contract to a document                    containing an arbitration clause constitutes an                    arbitration agreement if the contract is in writing and                    the reference is such as to make that arbitration                    clause part of the contract.”   11.     The term ‘agreement’ is not defined in the Arbitration Act, albeit it is          defined in Section 10 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 (for short,          the ‘Contract Act’),11 as contracts made by free consent of parties          competent to contract, for a lawful consideration and with a lawful          object, and are not thereby expressly declared to be void. Section          10 of the Contract Act also stipulates that aforesaid requirements          shall not affect any law in force in India (and not expressly          repealed) by which a contract is required to be made in writing, in          presence of witnesses or any law relating to registration of          documents. Thus, an arbitration agreement should satisfy the          mandate of Section 10 of the Contract Act, in addition to satisfying  11 10. What agreements are contracts. — All agreements are contracts if they are made by the free consent of parties competent to contract, for a lawful consideration and with a lawful object, and are not hereby expressly declared to be void. Nothing herein contained shall affect any law in force in India, and not hereby expressly repealed, by which any contract is required to be made in writing or in the presence of witnesses, or any law relating to the registration of documents.                                                    12 other requirements stipulated in the Section 7 of the Arbitration Act.  Sections 12 to 18 of the Contract Act state when a person can be  said to be of a sound mind for the purpose of contracting and  define the expressions ‘consent’, ‘free consent’, ‘coercion’, ‘undue  influence’, ‘fraud’ and ‘misrepresentation’. Sections 19 to 23 relate  to voidability of agreements, the power to set aside contracts  induced by undue influence, when both the parties are under  mistake as to a matter of fact, effect of a mistake as to the law,  effect of a mistake by one party as to a matter of fact and what  considerations and objects are lawful and unlawful. Sections 24 to  30 relate to void contracts and Sections 26 and 27 therein state  that agreements in restraint of marriage and agreements in  restraint of trade, respectively are void, albeit Explanation (1) to  Section 27 saves agreements for not carrying out the business of  which goodwill is sold. Section 28 of the Contract Act states that  agreements in restraint of legal proceedings are void, but  Explanation (1) specifically saves contracts by which two or more  persons agree that any dispute, or one which may arise between  them, in respect of any subject or class of subjects shall be  referred to arbitration. Arbitration agreement must satisfy the  objective mandates of the law of contract to qualify as an                                13         agreement. Clauses (g) and (h) of Section 2 of the Contract Act          state that an agreement not enforceable in law is void and an          agreement enforceable in law is a contract. As a sequitur, it follows          that an arbitration agreement that is not enforceable in law is void          and not legally valid.   12.     Sub-section (1) to Section 7 ordains that the arbitration agreement          should be in respect of disputes arising from a defined legal          relationship, whether contractual or not. The expression ‘legal          relationship’, again not defined in the Arbitration Act, means a          relationship which gives rise to legal obligations and duties and,          therefore, confers a right. These rights may be contractual or even          non-contractual.12 Non-contractual disputes would require a          separate or submission arbitration agreement based on the cause          of action arising in tort, restitution, breach of statutory duty or some          other non-contractual cause of action.13     12 Legal relationship will be normally followed by certain immediate or remote consequences in the form of action or non-action by the judicial and executive agents of the society as distinct from purely private affairs or other events which have nothing to do with law. Legal relationship exists in every situation that is or may be procedurally asserted for a declaration or denial of a right or for imposition of a sanction or any other purpose within the scope of adjudicative action. In actual practice, objection regarding defined legal relationship is seldom raised and tested.  13 Russell on Arbitration, 24th Edition # 2-004                                                     14 13.   Sub-section (2) to Section 7 is of some importance as it states that        an arbitration clause may be in the form of a separate agreement        or form a part of the underlying or another contract. Clause (3) of        Section 7 of the Arbitration Act states that the arbitration        agreement shall be in writing, that is, the agreement should be        evidenced in writing. By clause (4) the term ‘arbitration agreement        in writing’ would include any agreement by exchange of letters,        telegrams, electronic mails or communications which provide a        record of the agreement or exchange of statements of claim and        defence in which one party claims the existence of the agreement        and the other party does not deny it. Sub-section (5) to Section 7        states that reference in a contract to a document containing an        arbitration clause would constitute a valid arbitration agreement if        the contract is in writing and reference is made to the arbitration        clause that forms a part of the contract.    14.   Questions as to the existence of an arbitration agreement also        arise when a party opposing the reference raises plea of novation        of contract by entering into a new contract in substitution of the        original or ‘accord and satisfaction’ by acceptance of modified        obligations in discharge of the contract by performance or simple                                       15       termination by express or implied consent. Similar plea of        discharge can be raised opposing an application for reference on        the ground that the claim is long barred and dead or there are no        outstanding   disputes    as   the   parties     have   accepted   part        performance or have absolved the other side from performance,        fully or partly, on account of frustration or otherwise. The        contention is that once the original contract stands extinguished,        abandoned, repudiated or substituted, the arbitration clause in the        underlying/original contract perishes with it.    15.   Arbitration being a matter of contract, the parties are entitled to fix        boundaries as to confer and limit the jurisdiction and legal authority        of the arbitrator. An arbitration agreement can be comprehensive        and broad to include any dispute or could be confined to specific        disputes. The issue of scope of arbitrator’s jurisdiction invariably        arises when the disputes that are arbitrable are enumerated or the        arbitration agreement provides for exclusions as in case of        ‘excepted matters’. The arbitration agreement may be valid, but        the arbitral tribunal in view of the will of the parties expressed in        the arbitration agreement, may not have jurisdiction to adjudicate                                          16        the dispute. The will of the parties as to the scope of arbitration is a         subjective act and personal to the parties.    16.    Another facet, not highlighted earlier, arises from the dictum in         Sukanya Holdings (P) Ltd. v. Jayesh H. Pandya and Another,14         a decision upholding rejection of an application under Section 8, on         the ground that there is no provision in the Arbitration Act to         bifurcate and divide the causes or parties, that is, the subject         matter of the suit/judicial proceedings, and parties to the arbitration         agreement. The suit should be in respect of a ‘matter’ which the         parties have agreed to refer and which comes within the ambit of         the arbitration agreement. The words ‘a matter’, it was interpreted,         would indicate that the entire subject matter of the suit should be         subject to arbitration agreement. Bifurcation of subject matter or         causes of action in the suit is not permissible and contemplated.         Similarly, the parties to the suit should be bound by the arbitration         agreement, as there is no provision in the Arbitration Act to compel         third persons who have not exercised the option to give up the         right to have access to courts and be bound by the arbitration         clause. This would violate party autonomy and consensual nature   14 (2003) 5 SCC 531                                        17       of arbitration.   Bifurcation in such cases would result in a suit        being divided into two parts, one being decided by the arbitral        tribunal, and the other by the court or judicial authorities. This        would defeat the entire purpose and inevitably delay the        proceedings and increase cost of litigation, cause harassment and        on occasions give rise to conflicting judgments and orders by two        different fora. Cause of action in relation to the subject matter        relates to the scope of the arbitration agreement and whether the        dispute can be resolved by arbitration. Second mandate relating to        common parties exposits the inherent limitation of the arbitration        process which is consensual and mutual, an aspect we would        subsequently examine.   17.   A two Judges’ Bench in Booz Allen & Hamilton Inc., while        interpreting the dictum in Sukanya Holdings (P) Ltd., had drawn a        distinction between ambit and scope of judicial inquiry while        deciding an application under Section 8(1) of the Arbitration Act        which is filed in pending civil suit/judicial proceedings and an        application for reference of the dispute to arbitration under Section        11 of the Arbitration Act. In Booz Allen & Hamilton Inc. it was        observed:                                       18                 “32. The nature and scope of issues arising for                 consideration in an application under Section 11 of                 the Act for appointment of arbitrators, are far narrower                 than those arising in an application under Section 8 of                 the Act, seeking reference of the parties to a suit to                 arbitration. While considering an application under                 Section 11 of the Act, the Chief Justice or his                 designate would not embark upon an examination of                 the issue of “arbitrability” or appropriateness of                 adjudication by a private forum, once he finds that                 there was an arbitration agreement between or                 among the parties, and would leave the issue of                 arbitrability for the decision of the Arbitral Tribunal. If                 the arbitrator wrongly holds that the dispute is                 arbitrable, the aggrieved party will have to challenge                 the award by filing an application under Section 34 of                 the Act, relying upon sub-section (2)(b)(i) of that                 section.”                 However, in SBP & Co. v. Patel Engineering Ltd. and         Another,15 the majority judgment of the Constitution Bench of         seven Judges had noticed the complementary nature of Sections 8         and 11 of the Arbitration Act, and has observed:                  “16. We may at this stage notice the complementary                 nature of Sections 8 and 11. Where there is an                 arbitration agreement between the parties and one of                 the parties, ignoring it, files an action before a judicial                 authority and the other party raises the objection that                 there is an arbitration clause, the judicial authority has                 to consider that objection and if the objection is found                 sustainable to refer the parties to arbitration. The                 expression used in this section is “shall” and this                 Court in P. Anand Gajapathi Raju v. P.V.G. Raju and                 in Hindustan Petroleum Corpn. Ltd. v. Pinkcity                 Midway Petroleums has held that the judicial authority                 is bound to refer the matter to arbitration once the                 existence of a valid arbitration clause is established.                 Thus, the judicial authority is entitled to, has to and is 15 (2005) 8 SCC 618                                           19         bound to decide the jurisdictional issue raised before         it, before making or declining to make a reference.         Section 11 only covers another situation. Where one         of the parties has refused to act in terms of the         arbitration agreement, the other party moves the         Chief Justice under Section 11 of the Act to have an         arbitrator appointed and the first party objects, it         would be incongruous to hold that the Chief Justice         cannot decide the question of his own jurisdiction to         appoint an arbitrator when in a parallel situation, the         judicial authority can do so. Obviously, the highest         judicial authority has to decide that question and his         competence to decide cannot be questioned.

These three reliefs2 are reflected in prayers (a), (b) and (c) of the petition before  the High Court.     1     CR No. 0059 of 2018 2     ?(a)  Issue a writ of habeas corpus and/or any other similar writ, order and direction of like nature, directing           the Respondents to produce the Petitioner who has been illegally arrested and wrongfully detained by           the Respondent No. 2 in relation to FIR, being C.R. No. 0059 of 2018 dated 5 May 2018, registered at           Alibaug Police Station, Raigad, under Sections 306 and 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, despite a           closure report being filed;      (b)  Issue a writ of mandamus and/or any other similar writ, order and direction of like nature, quashing the           FIR, being C.R.

The High Court posted the hearing of the petition for considering the  prayer for quashing of the FIR on 10 December 2020. It declined to accede to the  prayer for the grant of bail, placing reliance on a decision of this Court in State of  Telangana vs Habib Abdullah Jeelani4 (?Habib Jeelani?). The High Court was  of the view that the prayers for interim relief proceeded on the premise that the  appellant had been illegally detained and since he was in judicial custody, it  would not entertain the request for bail or for stay of the investigation in the  exercise of its extra-ordinary jurisdiction. The High Court held that since the  appellant was in judicial custody, it was open to him to avail of the remedy of bail  under Section 439 of the CrPC. The High Court declined prima facie to consider  the submission of the appellant that the allegations in the FIR, read as they  stand, do not disclose the commission of an offence under Section 306 of the  IPC. That is how the case has come to this Court. The appellant is aggrieved by  the denial of his interim prayer for the grant of bail.     3     ?(a) Pending final hearing and disposal of the captioned writ petition, this Hon'ble Court be pleased to grant          bail to the Petitioner in FIR No. 59 of 2018 and direct the Respondents and/or each of them to          immediately release the Petitioner from illegal detention and wrongful custody and/or arrest by the          Respondents in view of detailed submissions made herein above, to meet the ends of justice.    (b)   Pending the final hearing and disposal of the captioned writ petition, this Hon'ble Court be pleased to          stay all further proceedings, including the investigation in FIR No. 59 of 2018, with respect to the          Petitioner.? 4   (2017) 2 SCC 779                                                          4                                                                                PART B  B     The parties, the FIR and ‘A’ Summary    4     The appellant is the Editor-in-Chief of an English television news channel,  Republic TV. He is also the Managing Director of ARG Outlier Media Asianet  News Private Limited which owns and operates a Hindi television news channel  by the name of R Bharat. The appellant anchors shows on both channels.   5     The appellant was arrested on 4 November 2020 in connection with FIR 59  of 2018 which was registered at Alibaug Police Station under Sections 306 and  34 of the IPC.   6     The genesis of the FIR can be traced back to December 2016, when a  company by the name of ARG Outlier Media Private Limited (?ARG?) awarded a  contract for civil and interior work to another company, Concorde Design Private  Limited (?CDPL?) which was owned substantially by Anvay Naik (the  ?deceased?).   7     The FIR was registered on 5 May 2018 on the complaint of Akshyata  Anvay Naik (the ?informant?), the spouse of the deceased who is alleged to have  committed suicide.

Nilesh Sarda the             persons whose names written in said suicide note by my             husband Anvay Madhukar Naik that the abovementioned             amount was due from them and even after continuously             demanding the said amount have not paid the said amount             and therefore my husband was under great pressure             therefore my husband Anvay Naik Age 53 years and my             mother in law Kumud Madhukar Naik died and the information             of such contents was registered and PI Shri Warade is             investigating the said offence.?   The FIR records thus:   (i)   The appellant (who owns the company ARG) had not paid an amount of        Rs. 83 lacs for the Bombay Dyeing Studio project. In addition, there was        an outstanding amount of Rs. 4 crores from Feroz Shaikh and Rs. 55 lacs        from Nitesh Sarda (who are the appellants in the connected Criminal        Appeals);                                                7                                                                            PART B  (ii)    The spouse of the informant had not received payment for the work which          was carried out by him, as a result of which he was under mental pressure          and that he committed suicide by hanging on 5 May 2018;  (iii)   There is a ?suicide note‘ holding the above three individuals responsible;          and  (iv)    The informant was informed on 5 May 2018, when she and her daughter          were at their residence at Mumbai, that her mother-in-law Kumud Naik had          died at their Alibaug residence. On the way to Alibaug, she was informed          that her husband had committed suicide. On reaching the house at          Alibaug, she found the body of her mother-in-law lying on a bed and that          her spouse had committed suicide by hanging.   8       On 6 May 2018, officers from the Alibaug Police Station visited ARG‘s  office in Mumbai and served three notices under Section 91 of the CrPC. On 7  and 8 May 2018, two representatives of ARG visited Alibaug Police Station where  they claim to have handed over the information which was sought by the police in  their notices under Section 91. On 22 May 2018, the appellant submitted a  representation to the notice under Section 91 following which on 30 May 2018  and 28 June 2018, the statements of the Chief Financial Officer and Company  Secretary of ARG were recorded.   9       On 16 April 2019, the SHO at Alibaug Police Station filed a report in the  Court of the Chief Judicial Magistrate (?CJM?) for an ?A‘ summary. The CJM  passed an order accepting the report and granted an ?A‘ summary. The meaning  and import of an ?A‘ summary is reflected in Para 219 (3) of the Bombay Police  Manual, 1959. An ?A‘ Summary indicates a case where an offence has been                                          8                                                                                  PART B  committed but it is undetected, in that there is no clue about the culprits or the  property, or where the accused is known but there is no evidence to justify their  being sent up to the Magistrate for trial. Para 219 (3) of the Bombay Police  Manual reads thus:               ""RULE 219 (3) OF BOMBAY POLICE MANUAL               (3) The final report should be written up carefully by the              officers incharge of the Police Station personally and should              be accompanied by all the case papers numbered and              indexed methodically. If the accused has been released on              bail, the Magistrate should be requested to cancel the bail              bond. He should also be requested to pass orders regarding              the disposal of property attached, unless any of the articles,              e.g., blood stained clothes, are required for further use in true              but undetected cases. A request should also be made to the              Magistrate to classify the case and to issue an appropriate              summary of his order, viz:-              ""A"" True. undetected (where there is no clue whatsoever              about the culprits or property or where the accused in known              but there is no evidence to justify his being sent up to the              Magistrate (for trial).              ""B"" Maliciously false.              ""C"" Neither true nor false, e.g., due to mistake to fact or being              of a civil nature.              ""Non-cognizable"" Police investigation reveals commission of              only non-cognizable offence.""     10    Following the ?A‘ summary, there was an exchange of correspondence  between ARG and the informant. ARG by their letter dated 11 June 2019,  addressed to CDPL, the informant and her daughter, indicated that several  meetings had been held in the past between them during the course of which  ARG had sought indemnities from CDPL against any future claims. In its letter,  ARG stated that it would be transferring a sum of Rs. 39.01 lacs into CDPL‘s last  known bank account against an indemnity for future claims by the creditors or  lenders of CDPL. In response, on 15 June 2019, the informant addressed a                                                 9                                                                            PART C  communication to ARG stating that out of a total billed amount of Rs. 6.45 crores,  an amount of Rs. 5.75 crores had been received from ARG, and after adjustment  of an amount of Rs. 70.39 lacs towards deductions made from the bill, an amount  of Rs. 88.02 lacs was due and payable. On 6 November 2019, ARG addressed  another letter to the informant recording the closure of the police investigation  and reiterating its readiness to pay an amount of Rs.39.01 lacs subject to due  authorisation. The matter appears to have rested there until a flurry of  developments took place in the month of April 2020.     C     Previous proceedings against the appellant    11    During the course of the present proceedings, the appellant has adverted  to proceedings initiated against him previously by the State of Maharashtra, in  order to support his case that the arrest is vitiated by malice in fact.   12    On 16 April 2020, a broadcast took place on Republic TV, followed by a  broadcast on Republic Bharat on 21 April 2020 in relation to an incident which  took place in Gadchinchle village of Palghar district in Maharashtra. During the  course of this incident on 16 April 2020, three persons, including two Sadhus,  were brutally killed by a mob, allegedly in the presence of the police and forest  guard personnel. According to the appellant, on his news show titled ?Poochta hai  Bharat? on 21 April 2020, he had raised issues in relation to the allegedly tardy  investigation of the incident by the police.   13    As this Court noticed in a judgment dated 19 May 2020, the broadcasts led  to the lodging of multiple FIRs and criminal complaints against the appellant in                                           10                                                                                         PART C  the States of Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan,                            Madhya Pradesh,  Telangana and Jharkhand as well as in the Union Territories of Jammu and  Kashmir. The content of the FIRs was similar, almost identical. In the State of  Maharashtra, an FIR was lodged at Police Station Sadar, District Nagpur City,  details of which were as follows:                       ""Maharashtra                      FIR No. 238 of 2020, dated 22 April 2020, registered at Police                      Station Sadar, District Nagpur City, Maharashtra, under                      Sections 153, 153-A, 153-B,295-A, 298, 500, 504(2), 506,                      120-B and 117 of the Indian Penal Code 1860.""    Apart from the above FIR, fourteen other FIRs and complaints were lodged  against the appellant in relation to his broadcasts.   14         The appellant moved this Court in proceedings under Article 32 of the  Constitution5 challenging the registration of these FIRs. By an interim order dated  24 April 2020, the FIR which had been lodged at Police Station Sadar, District  Nagpur City was transferred to NM Joshi Marg Police Station, Mumbai and was  renumbered as FIR 164 of 2020. Another FIR, FIR 137 of 2020, was registered  against the appellant on 2 May 2020 at the Pydhonie Police Station, Mumbai. FIR  137 of 2020 was filed against the appellant due to a telecast which took place on  29 April 2020 on the appellant‘s new channels, in which the appellant referred to  a gathering of migrant workers at the Bandra Railway station during the Covid-19  pandemic, and attempted to connect a place of religious worship with this     5     Writ Petition (Crl.) No. 130 of 2020                                                      11                                                                              PART C  gathering. The appellant filed another petition under Article 32 of the  Constitution6, challenging the registration of FIR 137 of 2020.   15         By its judgment dated 19 May 2020, this Court quashed all the FIRs,  except for the FIR which was transferred from Nagpur to Mumbai, on the ground  that successive FIRs/complaints in respect of the same cause could not be  maintained. The court granted liberty to the appellant to pursue such remedies as  were available in law before the competent forum for quashing FIR 164 of 2020.   16         By an order dated 30 June 2020, a Division Bench of the Bombay High  Court, while entertaining a petition under Articles 226/227 of the Constitution and  Section 482 of the CrPC, suspended all further proceedings in FIR 164 of 2020  before the NM Joshi Marg Police Station and FIR 137 of 2020 before the  Pydhonie Police Station and confirmed its interim order dated 6 June 2020  restraining the State from taking coercive steps against the appellant in relation to  the two FIRs, pending the disposal of the petition.   17         Aside from this incident, the appellant has relied on certain other  developments which have taken place thereafter. These are:   (i)        The arrest on 9 September 2020 by the Maharashtra Police of two             employees of the appellant‘s news channel alleged to be pursuing an             investigative lead in Raigad, Maharashtra and the registration of FIR 142             of 2020 at Khalapur Police Station, Raigad under Sections 452, 448, 323,             504 and 506 read with Section 34 of the IPC;     6     Writ Petition (Crl.) Diary No. 1189 of 2020                                                    12                                                                                   PART C  (ii)        The issuance of a letter by the ?Shiv Cable Sena? to cable operators              across Maharashtra asking them to ban the telecast of the appellant‘s              news channel;  (iii)       An order of the Bombay High Court dated 11 September 2020 in a Writ              Petition under Article 226 holding that the letter of the Shiv Cable Sena did              not have the force of law and the appellant would be at liberty to pursue              the remedies available in law;  (iv)        On 16 September 2020, a notice to show cause was issued to the              appellant for breach of privilege of the legislative assembly, which is the              subject of proceedings instituted in this court;  (v)         A notice to show cause was issued under Section 108(1) of the CrPC to              the appellant by the Special Executive Magistrate, in spite of the order of              the Bombay High Court;  (vi)        The registration of FIR 843 of 2020 on 6 October 2020 at Kandivali Police              Station (later transferred to the Crime Intelligence Unit, Mumbai) on a              complaint by an employee of Hansa Research Group Private Limited in              relation to the ?TRP scam‘;  (vii)       A press conference by the Commissioner of Police Mumbai on 8 October              2020 mentioning the name of the appellant as being allegedly involved in              the ?TRP scam‘;  (viii)      The appellant instituted a Writ Petition under Article 32 of the Constitution7              before this Court seeking reliefs in respect of FIR 843 of 2020. By an order     7     Writ Petition (Crl.) 312 of 2020                                                 13                                                                                PART D         dated 15 October 2020, the Writ Petition was dismissed as withdrawn with         liberty to the appellant to approach the Bombay High Court; and  (ix)   The appellant filed Writ Petition (Crl.) Stamp No. 3143 of 2020 before the         Bombay High Court, in which on 19 October 2020 an order was passed         calling upon the Investigating Officer to submit the investigation paper in a         sealed envelope on 4 November 2020. The High Court noted that the         appellant had as on date not been arrayed as an accused in the FIR and if         the investigating officer proposed to make an enquiry, a summons shall be         issued to him. The appellant agreed to cooperate in the enquiry.    D      Re-opening of investigation and arrest of the appellant   18     On 26 May 2020, the Home Department of the State of Maharashtra  addressed a communication to Deputy Inspector General of Police stating that  the FIR registered as Crime No. 59 of 2020, at Alibaug Police Station under  Sections 306/34 of the IPC, was being transferred to the crime investigation  department ?for the purpose of reinvestigation?. The letter, insofar as is material,  reads thus:                ?In respect of the above mentioned subject, you are hereby               informed that crime no. 59/2020 registered at Alibaug Police               Station under Section 306/34 and Crime no. 114 of 2018               registered at Alibaug Police Station under Section 302 are               being transferred to Crime Investigation Department for the               purposes of reinvestigation. Hence, you are requested to               undertake the necessary steps for handing over the case for               reinvestigation and report in respect of investigation already               been made be submitted to the Government.?                                                  14                                                                              PART D  19    On 15 October 2020, the Local Crime Investigation Branch, Raigad  addressed a communication to the CJM, Alibaug recording the commencement  of further investigation under Section 173(8) of the CrPC in respect of Crime No.  59 of 2018 under Section 306 read with Section 34 of the IPC.   20    On 4 November 2020, the appellant was arrested at about 7:45 am in  connection with FIR 59 of 2018 dated 5 May 2018. At 2:37 pm, the appellant filed  a Writ Petition before the Bombay High Court, invoking the provisions of Articles  226/227 of the Constitution and Section 482 of the CrPC.   21    After the appellant‘s arrest, a remand application was filed before the CJM,  Raigad. By an order dated 4 November 2020, the CJM declined to grant police  custody. Noting that there had been an ?A‘ summary previously, the CJM while  rejecting the plea of police custody, remanded the appellant to judicial custody till  18 November 2020. The State has challenged the order of the CJM declining  police custody in a revision before the Additional Sessions Judge, Raigad.   22    The writ petition filed by the appellant before the Bombay High Court was  heard on 5, 6 and 7 November 2020. On 7 November 2020, the High Court  reserved orders and granted liberty to the appellant to file an application for  regular bail under Section 439 of the CrPC with a direction that it should be heard  expeditiously within four days of the date of filing. Following the above direction,  the appellant moved the Sessions Court, Raigad for bail under Section 439 of the  CrPC. By its impugned judgment and order dated 9 November 2020, the High  Court posted the hearing of the petition filed by the appellant in regard to the  prayer of quashing of the FIR on 10 December 2020. While doing so, the High                                            15                                                                                 PART E  Court denied bail to the appellant on the ground that no case has been made out  for the exercise of the extra-ordinary jurisdiction and that the appellant had an  alternate and efficacious remedy under Section 439 of the CrPC.     E       Submissions of counsel   23      Assailing the order of the High Court denying bail to the appellant, Mr  Harish N Salve, learned Senior Counsel, submitted that:   (i)     The arrest of the appellant is rooted in malice in fact, which is evident from          the manner in which the appellant as the Editor-in-Chief of Republic TV          and R Bharat has been targeted for his news broadcasts criticizing the          Maharashtra government and the Maharashtra police;  (ii)    Following the acceptance of the police report and the issuance of an ?A‘          summary on 16 April 2019, the reinvestigation which has been ordered at          the behest of the Home Minister of the State of Maharashtra is ultra vires.          Further, in the absence of the specific permission of the CJM, it was not          open to the State to conduct a reinvestigation; and  (iii)   The allegations contained in the FIR, read as they stand, do not establish          an offence under Section 306 read with Section 34 of the IPC. To          constitute the offence of abetment there must exist:           i.    A direct or indirect incitement to the commission of a crime;          ii.    An active role of the accused in instigating or doing an act facilitating                 the commission of the crime; and          iii.   The existence of a proximate relationship in time.                                                16                                                                                PART E  In the present case, it was submitted that even if the allegations in the FIR are  accepted as they stand, no case of abetment is established. It has been  submitted that the company of the appellant (ARG) had entrusted a contract for  interior work to the deceased‘s company (CDPL). Further, it is not in dispute that  while an amount of Rs 5.45 crores has been paid, there was a commercial  dispute pending in regard to the remaining payment between the two companies.  The contents of the FIR also reveal that the deceased was suffering from mental  pressure. Furthermore, there is absolutely no allegation that the appellant had  either instigated or committed any act to facilitate the commission of the crime.   24    Mr Salve further submitted that the judgment of this Court in Habib Jeelani  (supra) has been wrongly interpreted by the High Court. It has been submitted  that it was in pursuance of the liberty that "

The petitioners have questioned the provisions inserted by way           of carving out section 18A of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled           Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 (Act of 1989). Section 18 as           well as section 18A, are reproduced hereunder:                              “18. Section 438 of the Code not to apply to persons committing an                             offence under the Act.—Nothing in section 438 of the Code shall                             apply in relation to any case involving the arrest of any person on an                             accusation of having committed an offence under this Act.”                             “Section 18A. (i) For the purpose of this Act,-  Signature Not Verified      (a) preliminary enquiry shall be required for registration of a First Digitally signed by JAYANT KUMAR ARORA Date: 2020.02.10                             Information Report against any person; or 18:13:23 IST Reason:                               (b) the investigating officer shall not require approval for the arrest, if                             necessary, of any person, against whom an accusation of having                             committed an offence under this Act has been made, and no procedure                             other than that provided under this Act or the Code shall apply.                                             2             (ii) The provisions of section 438 of the Code shall not apply to a case          under this Act, notwithstanding any judgment or order or direction of          any Court.”   2.   It is submitted that section 18A has been enacted to nullify the  judgment of this Court in Dr. Subhash Kashinath Mahajan v. The State  of Maharashtra & Anr., (2018) 6 SCC 454, in which following  directions were issued:           “83. Our conclusions are as follows:          (i) Proceedings in the present case are clear abuse of process of court          and are quashed.          (ii) There is no absolute bar against grant of anticipatory bail in cases          under the Atrocities Act if no prima facie case is made out or where on          judicial scrutiny the complaint is found to be prima facie mala fide.          We approve the view taken and approach of the Gujarat High Court in          Pankaj D. Suthar (supra) and Dr. N.T. Desai (supra) and clarify the          judgments of this Court in Balothia (supra) and Manju Devi (supra);          (iii) In view of acknowledged abuse of law of arrest in cases under the          Atrocities Act, arrest of a public servant can only be after approval of          the appointing authority and of a non-public servant after approval by          the S.S.P. which may be granted in appropriate cases if considered          necessary for reasons recorded. Such reasons must be scrutinised by          the Magistrate for permitting further detention.          (iv) To avoid false implication of an innocent, a preliminary enquiry          may be conducted by the DSP concerned to find out whether the          allegations make out a case under the Atrocities Act and that the          allegations are not frivolous or motivated.          (v) Any violation of directions (iii) and (iv) will be actionable by way          of disciplinary action as well as contempt.           The above directions are prospective.”   3.   It has been submitted that this Court has noted in Dr. Subhash  Kashinath (supra) that the provisions of the Act of 1989 are being  misused as such the amendment is arbitrary, unjust, irrational and  violative of Article 21 of the Constitution of India. There could not have  been any curtailment of the right to obtain anticipatory bail under                                           3   section 438 Cr.PC. Prior scrutiny and proper investigation are  necessary. Most of the safeguards have been provided under the Act of  1989 to prevent undue harassment. This Court has struck down the  provision of section 66A of the Information Technology Act on the  ground of violation of fundamental rights; on the same anvil, the  provisions of section 18A of the Act of 1989 deserve to be struck down.   4.   It is not disputed at the Bar that the provisions in section 18A in  the Act of 1989 had been enacted because of the judgment passed by  this Court in Dr. Subhash Kashinath's case (supra), mainly because of  direction Nos (iii) to (v) contained in para 83. The Union of India had  filed review petitions, and the same have been allowed, and direction  Nos (iii) to (v) have been recalled. Thus, in view of the judgment passed  in the review petitions, the matter is rendered of academic importance  as we had restored the position as prevailed by various judgments that  were in vogue before the matter of Dr. Subhash Kashinath (supra) was  decided. We are not burdening the decision as facts and reasons have  been assigned in detail while deciding review petitions on 1.10.2019  and only certain clarifications are required in view of the provisions  carved out in section 18A. There can be protective discrimination, not  reverse one. We have dealt with various questions in the review  petitions while deciding the same as under:        “36. In the light of the discussion mentioned above of legal principles,       we advert to directions issued in paragraph 83. Direction Nos. (iii) and                                      4   (iv) and consequential direction No. (v) are sought                to   be reviewed/recalled. Directions contain the following aspects: -  1.    That arrest of a public servant can only be after approval of the appointing authority. 2.    The arrest of a non-public servant after approval by the Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP). 3. The arrest may be in an appropriate case if considered necessary for reasons to be recorded; 4.    Reasons for arrest must be scrutinised by the Magistrate for permitting further detention; 5.    Preliminary enquiry to be conducted by the Dy. S.P. level officers to find out whether the allegations make out a case and that the allegations are not frivolous or motivated. 6. Any violation of the directions mentioned above will be actionable by way of disciplinary action as well as contempt.  37. Before we dilate upon the aforesaid directions, it is necessary to take note of certain aspects. It cannot be disputed that as the members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes have suffered for long; the protective discrimination has been envisaged under Article 15 of the Constitution of India and the provisions of the Act of 1989 to make them equals.  38. All the offences under the Atrocities Act are cognizable. The impugned directions put the riders on the right to arrest. An accused cannot be arrested in atrocities cases without the concurrence of the higher Authorities or appointing authority as the case may be. As per the existing provisions, the appointing authority has no power to grant or withhold sanction to arrest concerning a public servant.  39. The National Commission for Scheduled Castes Annual Report 2015-16, has recommended for prompt registration of FIRs thus: ""The Commission has noted with concern that instances of procedural lapses are frequent while dealing atrocity cases by both police and civil administration. There are delays in the judicial process of the cases. The Commission, therefore, identified lacunae commonly noticed during police investigation, as also preventive/curable actions the civil administration can take. NCSC recommends the correct and timely application of SC/ST (PoA) Amendment Act, 2015 and Amendment Rules of 2016 as well as the following for improvement:      “8.6.1 Registration of FIRs - The Commission has observed that      the police often resort to preliminary investigation upon receiving a      complaint in writing before lodging the actual FIRs. As a result, the      SC victims have to resort to seeking directions from courts for      registration of FIRs u/s 156(3) of Cr.P.C. Hon’ble Supreme Court      has also on more than one occasion emphasized about registration      of FIR first. This Commission again reemphasizes that the State /      UT Governments should enforce prompt registration of FIRs.”                                                      (emphasis supplied)                                       5   40. The learned Attorney General pointed out that the statistics considered by the Court in the judgment under review indicate that 9 to 10 percent cases under the Act were found to be false. The percentage of false cases concerning other general crimes such as forgery is comparable, namely 11.51 percent and for kidnapping and abduction, it is 8.85 percent as per NCRB data for the year 2016. The same can be taken care of by the Courts under Section 482, and in case no prima facie case is made out, the Court can always consider grant of anticipatory bail and power of quashing in appropriate cases. For the low conviction rate, he submitted that same is the reflection of the failure of the criminal justice system and not an abuse of law. The witnesses seldom come to support down-trodden class, biased mindset continues, and they are pressurised in several manners, and the complainant also hardly muster the courage.  41. As to prevailing conditions in various areas of the country, we are compelled to observe that SCs/STs are still making the struggle for equality and for exercising civil rights in various areas of the country. The members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes are still discriminated against in various parts of the country. In spite of reservation, the fruits of development have not reached to them, by and large, they remain unequal and vulnerable section of the society. The classes of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes have been suffering ignominy and abuse, and they have been outcast socially for the centuries. The efforts for their upliftment should have been percolated down to eradicate their sufferings.  42. Though, Article 17 of the Constitution prohibits untouchability, whether untouchability has vanished? We have to find the answer to all these pertinent questions in the present prevailing social scenario in different parts of the country. The clear answer is that untouchability though intended to be abolished, has not vanished in the last 70 years. We are still experimenting with ‘tryst with destiny.' The plight of untouchables is that they are still denied various civil rights; the condition is worse in the villages, remote areas where fruits of development have not percolated down. They cannot enjoy equal civil rights. So far, we have not been able to provide the modern methods of scavenging to Harijans due to lack of resources and proper planning and apathy. Whether he can shake hand with a person of higher class on equal footing? Whether we have been able to reach that level of psyche and human dignity and able to remove discrimination based upon caste? Whether false guise of cleanliness can rescue the situation, how such condition prevails and have not vanished, are we not responsible? The answer can only be found by soul searching. However, one thing is sure that we have not been able to eradicate untouchability in a real sense as envisaged and we have not been able to provide down-trodden class the fundamental civil rights and amenities, frugal comforts of life which make life worth living. More so, for Tribals who are at some places still kept in isolation as we have not been able to provide them even basic amenities, education and frugal comforts of life in spite of spending a considerable amount for the protection, how long this would continue. Whether they have to remain in the status quo and to entertain civilized                                        6   society? Whether under the guise of protection of the culture, they are deprived of fruits of development, and they face a violation of traditional rights?  43. In Khadak Singh vs. State of Himachal Pradesh, AIR 1963 SC 1295, this Court has observed that the right to life is not merely an animal's existence. Under Article 21, the right to life includes the right to live with dignity. Basic human dignity implies that all the persons are treated as equal human in all respects and not treated as an untouchable, downtrodden, and object for exploitation. It also implies that they are not meant to be born for serving the elite class based upon the caste. The caste discrimination had been deep-rooted, so the consistent effort is on to remove it, but still, we have to achieve the real goal. No doubt we have succeeded partially due to individual and collective efforts.  44. The enjoyment of quality life by the people is the essence of guaranteed right under Article 21 of the Constitution, as observed in Hinch Lal Tiwari v. Kamla Devi, (2001) 6 SCC 496. Right to live with human dignity is included in the right to life as observed in Francis Coralie Mullin v. Union Territory Delhi, Administrator, AIR 1981 SC 746, Olga Tellis v. Bombay Corporation, AIR 1986 SC 180. Gender injustice, pollution, environmental degradation, malnutrition, social ostracism of Dalits are instances of human rights violations as observed by this Court in People’s Union for Civil Liberties v. Union of India, (2005) 2 SCC 436:           ""34. The question can also be examined from another angle. The           knowledge or experience of a police officer of human rights           violation represents only one facet of human rights violation and           its protection, namely, arising out of crime. Human rights           violations are of various forms which besides police brutality are           — gender injustice, pollution, environmental degradation,           malnutrition, social ostracism of Dalits, etc. A police officer can           claim to have experience of only one facet. That is not the           requirement of the section.""                   (emphasis supplied)   45. There is right to live with dignity and also right to die with dignity. For violation of human rights under Article 21 grant of compensation is one of the concomitants which has found statutory expression in the provisions of compensation, to be paid in case an offence is committed under the provisions of the Act of 1989. A good reputation is an element of personal security and is protected by the Constitution equally with the right to the enjoyment of life, liberty, and property. Therefore, it has been held to be an essential element of the right to life of a citizen under Article 21 as observed by this Court in Umesh Kumar v. State of Andhra Pradesh, (2013) 10 SCC 591, Kishore Samrite v. State of Uttar Pradesh, (2013) 2 SCC 398 and Subramanian Swamy v. Union of India, (2016) 7 SCC 221. The provisions of the Act of 1989 are, in essence, concomitants covering various facets of Article 21 of the Constitution of India. 46. They do labour, bonded or forced, in agricultural fields, which is not abrogated in spite of efforts. In certain areas, women are not treated                                        7   with dignity and honour and are sexually abused in various forms. We see sewer workers dying in due to poisonous gases in chambers. They are like death traps. We have not been able to provide the masks and oxygen cylinders for entering in sewer chambers, we cannot leave them to die like this and avoid tortious liability concerned with officials/machinery, and they are still discriminated within the society in the matter of enjoying their civil rights and cannot live with human dignity.  47. The Constitution of India provides equality before the law under the provisions contained in Article 14. Article 15(4) of the Constitution carves out an exception for making any special provision for the advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens or SCs. and STs. Further protection is conferred under Article 15(5) concerning their admission to educational institutions, including private educational institutions, whether aided or unaided by the State, other than the minority educational institutions. Historically disadvantageous groups must be given special protection and help so that they can be uplifted from their poverty and low social status as observed in Kailas & Ors. v. State of Maharashtra, 2011 (1) SCC 793. The legislature has to attempt such incumbents be protected under Article 15(4), to deal with them with more rigorous provisions as compared to provisions of general law available to the others would create inequality which is not permissible/envisaged constitutionally. It would be an action to negate mandatory constitutional provisions not supported by the constitutional scheme; rather, it would be against the mandated constitutional protection. It is not open to the legislature to put members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in a disadvantageous position vis-à-vis others and in particular to so-called upper castes/general category. Thus, they cannot be discriminated against more so when we have a peep into the background perspective. What legislature cannot do legitimately, cannot be done by the interpretative process by the courts.  48. The particular law, i.e., Act of 1989, has been enacted and has also been amended in 2016 to make its provisions more effective. Special prosecutors are to be provided for speedy trial of cases. The incentives are also provided for rehabilitation of victims, protection of witnesses and matters connected therewith.  49. There is no presumption that the members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes may misuse the provisions of law as a class and it is not resorted to by the members of the upper Castes or the members of the elite class. For lodging a false report, it cannot be said that the caste of a person is the cause. It is due to the human failing and not due to the caste factor. Caste is not attributable to such an act. On the other hand, members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes due to backwardness hardly muster the courage to lodge even a first information report, much less, a false one. In case it is found to be false/unsubstantiated, it may be due to the faulty investigation or for other various reasons including human failings irrespective of caste                                       8   factor. There may be certain cases which may be false that can be a ground for interference by the Court, but the law cannot be changed due to such misuse. In such a situation, it can be taken care in proceeding under section 482 of the Cr.PC.  50. The data of National Crime Records Bureau, Ministry of Home Affairs, has been pointed out on behalf of Union of India which indicates that more than 47,000 cases were registered in the year 2016 under the Act of 1989. The number is alarming, and it cannot be said that it is due to the outcome of the misuse of the provisions of the Act.  51. As a matter of fact, members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes have suffered for long, hence, if we cannot provide them protective discrimination beneficial to them, we cannot place them at all at a disadvantageous position that may be causing injury to them by widening inequality and against the very spirit of our Constitution. It would be against the basic human dignity to treat all of them as a liar or as a crook person and cannot look at every complaint by such complainant with a doubt. Eyewitnesses do not come up to speak in their favour. They hardly muster the courage to speak against upper caste, that is why provisions have been made by way of amendment for the protection of witnesses and rehabilitation of victims. All humans are equal including in their frailings. To treat SCs. and STs. as persons who are prone to lodge false reports under the provisions of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Act for taking revenge or otherwise as monetary benefits made available to them in the case of their being subjected to such offence, would be against fundamental human equality. It cannot be presumed that a person of such class would inflict injury upon himself and would lodge a false report only to secure monetary benefits or to take revenge. If presumed so, it would mean adding insult to injury, merely by the fact that person may misuse provisions cannot be a ground to treat class with doubt. It is due to human failings, not due to the caste factor. The monetary benefits are provided in the cases of an acid attack, sexual harassment of SC/ST women, rape, murder, etc. In such cases, FIR is required to be registered promptly.  52. It is an unfortunate state of affairs that the caste system still prevails in the country and people remain in slums, more particularly, under skyscrapers, and they serve the inhabitants of such buildings.  53. To treat such incumbents with a rider that a report lodged by an SCs/STs category, would be registered only after a preliminary investigation by Dy. S.P., whereas under Cr.PC a complaint lodged relating to cognizable offence has to be registered forthwith. It would mean a report by upper-caste has to be registered immediately and arrest can be made forthwith, whereas, in case of an offence under the Act of 1989, it would be conditioned one. It would be opposed to the protective discrimination meted out to the members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes as envisaged under the Constitution in Articles 15, 17 and 21 and would tantamount to treating them as unequal, somewhat                                       9   supportive action as per the mandate of Constitution is required to make them equals. It does not prima facie appear permissible to look them down in any manner. It would also be contrary to the procedure prescribed under the Cr.PC and contrary to the law laid down by this Court in Lalita Kumari (supra).  54. The guidelines in (iii) and (iv) appear to have been issued in view of the provisions contained in Section 18 of the Act of 1989; whereas adequate safeguards have been provided by a purposive interpretation by this Court in the case of State of M.P. v. R.K. Balothia, (1995) 3 SCC 221. The consistent view of this Court that if prima facie case has not been made out attracting the provisions of SC/ST Act of 1989, in that case, the bar created under section 18 on the grant of anticipatory bail is not attracted. Thus, misuse of the provisions of the Act is intended to be taken care of by the decision above. In Kartar Singh (supra), a Constitution Bench of this Court has laid down that taking away the said right of anticipatory bail would not amount to a violation of Article 21 of the Constitution of India. Thus, prima facie it appears that in the case of misuse of provisions, adequate safeguards are provided in the decision mentioned above.  55. That apart directions (iii) and (iv) issued may delay the investigation of cases. As per the amendment made in the Rules in the year 2016, a charge sheet has to be filed to enable timely commencement of the prosecution. The directions issued are likely to delay the timely scheme framed under the Act/Rules.  In re: sanction of the appointing authority :  56. Concerning public servants, the provisions contained in Section 197, Cr.PC provide protection by prohibiting cognizance of the offence without the sanction of the appointing authority and the provision cannot be applied at the stage of the arrest. That would run against the spirit of Section 197, Cr.PC. Section 41, Cr.PC authorises every police officer to carry out an arrest in case of a cognizable offence and the very definition of a cognizable offence in terms of Section 2(c) of Cr.PC is one for which police officer may arrest without warrant.  57. In case any person apprehends that he may be arrested, harassed and implicated falsely, he can approach the High Court for quashing the FIR under Section 482 as observed in State of Orissa v. Debendra Nath Padhi, (2005) 1 SCC 568.  58. While issuing guidelines mentioned above approval of appointing authority has been made imperative for the arrest of a public servant under the provisions of the Act in case, he is an accused of having committed an offence under the Act of 1989. Permission of the appointing authority to arrest a public servant is not at all statutorily envisaged; it is encroaching on a field which is reserved for the legislature. The direction amounts to a mandate having legislative colour which is a field not earmarked for the Courts.                                      10     59. The direction is discriminatory and would cause several legal complications. On what basis the appointing authority would grant permission to arrest a public servant? When the investigation is not complete, how it can determine whether public servant is to be arrested or not? Whether it would be appropriate for appointing authority to look into case diary in a case where its sanction for prosecution may not be required in an offence which has not happened in the discharge of official duty. Approaching appointing authority for approval of arrest of a public servant in every case under the Act of 1989 is likely to consume sufficient time. The appointing authority is not supposed to know the ground realities of the offence that has been committed, and arrest sometimes becomes necessary forthwith to ensure further progress of the investigation itself. Often the investigation cannot be completed without the arrest. There may not be any material before the appointing authority for deciding the question of approval. To decide whether a public servant should be arrested or not is not a function of appointing authority, it is wholly extra-statutory. In case appointing authority holds that a public servant is not to be arrested and declines approval, what would happen, as there is no provision for grant of anticipatory bail. It would tantamount to take away functions of Court. To decide whether an accused is entitled to bail under Section 438 in case no prima facie case is made out or under Section 439 is the function of the Court. The direction of appointing authority not to arrest may create conflict with the provisions of Act of 1989 and is without statutory basis.  60. By the guidelines issued, the anomalous situation may crop up in several cases. In case the appointing authority forms a view that as there is no prima facie case the incumbent is not to be arrested, several complications may arise. For the arrest of an offender, maybe a public servant, it is not the provision of the general law of Cr.PC that permission of the appointing authority is necessary. No such statutory protection provided to a public servant in the matter of arrest under the IPC and the Cr.PC as such it would be discriminatory to impose such rider in the cases under the Act of 1989. Only in the case of discharge of official duties, some offence appears to have been committed, in that case, sanction to prosecute may be required and not otherwise. In case the act is outside the purview of the official discharge of duty, no such sanction is required.  61. The appointing authority cannot sit over an FIR in case of cognizable, non-bailable offense and investigation made by the Police Officer; this function cannot be conferred upon the appointing authority as it is not envisaged either in the Cr.P.C. or the Act of 1989. Thus, this rider cannot be imposed in respect of the cases under the Act of 1989, may be that provisions of the Act are sometimes misused, exercise of power of approval of arrest by appointing authority is wholly impermissible, impractical besides it encroaches upon the field reserved for the legislature and is repugnant to the provisions of general law as no such rider is envisaged under the general law.                                       11     62. Assuming it is permissible to obtain the permission of appointing authority to arrest accused, would be further worsening the position of the members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. If they are not to be given special protection, they are not to be further put in a disadvantageous position. The implementation of the condition may discourage and desist them even to approach the Police and would cast a shadow of doubt on all members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes which cannot be said to be constitutionally envisaged. Other castes can misuse the provisions of law; also, it cannot be said that misuse of law takes place by the provisions of Act of 1989. In case the direction is permitted to prevail, days are not far away when writ petition may have to be filed to direct the appointing authority to consider whether accused can be arrested or not and as to the reasons recorded by the appointing authority to permit or deny the arrest. It is not the function of the appointing authority to intermeddle with a criminal investigation. If at the threshold, approval of appointing authority is made necessary for arrest, the very purpose of the Act is likely to be frustrated. Various complications may arise. Investigation cannot be completed within the specified time, nor trial can be completed as envisaged. Act of 1989 delay would be adding to the further plight of the downtrodden class.  In ref: approval of arrest by the SSP in the case of a non-public servant:  63. Inter alia for the reasons as mentioned earlier, we are of the considered opinion that requiring the approval of SSP before an arrest is not warranted in such a case as that would be discriminatory and against the protective discrimination envisaged under the Act. Apart from that, no such guidelines can prevail, which are legislative. When there is no provision for anticipatory bail, obviously arrest has to be made. Without doubting bona fides of any officer, it cannot be left at the sweet discretion of the incumbent howsoever high. The approval would mean that it can also be ordered that the person is not to be arrested then how the investigation can be completed when the arrest of an incumbent, is necessary, is not understandable. For an arrest of accused such a condition of approval of SSP could not have been made a sine qua non, it may delay the matter in the cases under the Act of 1989.  Requiring the Magistrate to scrutinise the reasons for permitting further detention:  64. As per guidelines issued by this Court, the public servant can be arrested after approval by appointing authority and that of a non-public servant after the approval of SSP. The reasons so recorded have to be considered by the Magistrate for permitting further detention. In case of approval has not been granted, this exercise has not been undertaken. When the offence is registered under the Act of 1989, the law should take its course no additional fetter sare called for on arrest whether in case of a public servant or non-public servant. Even otherwise, as we have not approved the approval of arrest by appointing authority/S.S.P., the                                            12         direction to record reasons and scrutiny by Magistrate consequently       stands nullified.        65. The direction has also been issued that the Dy. S.P. should conduct       a preliminary inquir"

Having noted that there is a clear conflict between the two  decisions of this Court, one in the case of Ch. Tika Ramji &  Others, Etc. vs. The State of Uttar Pradesh & Others [AIR  1956 SC 676 = 1956 SCR 393 = 1956 SCJ 625] and another  subsequent decision in the case of U.P. Cooperative Cane  Unions Federations vs. West U.P. Sugar Mills Association  and Others [(2004)5 SCC 430], a three Judge Bench of this                                                                    3     Court has referred the matter to a larger Bench proposing the  following questions of law to be considered by the larger Bench,  preferably of a Bench consisting of seven Judges of this Court:         (1)   Whether by virtue of Article 246 read with            Schedule VII List III Entry 33 of the Constitution            the field is occupied by the Central legislation and            hence the Central Government has the exclusive            power to fix the price of sugarcane?       (2)   Whether Section 16 or any other provision of the            U.P. Sugarcane (Regulation of Supply and            Purchase) Act, 1953 confers any power upon the            State Government to fix the price at which            sugarcane can be bought or sold?       (3)   If the answer to this question is in the affirmative,            then whether Section 16 or the said provision of            the U.P. Sugarcane (Regulation of Supply and            Purchase) Act, 1953 is repugnant to Section 3(2)(c)            of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 and            Clause 3 of the Sugarcane (Control) Order, 1966            [hereinafter referred to as “1966 Order”]? And if so,            the provisions of the Central enactments will            prevail over the provisions of the State enactment            and the State enactment to that extent would be            void under Article 254 of the Constitution of India.       (4)   Whether the SAP fixed by the State Government in            exercise of powers under Section 16 of the U.P.            Sugarcane (Regulation of Supply and Purchase)            Act, 1953 is arbitrary, without any application of            mind or rational basis and is therefore, invalid and            illegal?                                                                        4          (5)      Does the State Advised Price (for short “SAP”)               constitute a statutory fixation of price? If so, is it               within the legislative competence of the State?       (6)      Whether the power to fix the price of sugarcane is               without any guidelines and suffers from               conferment of arbitrary and uncanalised power               which is violative of Articles 14 and 19(1)(g) of the               Constitution of India?  2.   The core issue is whether the State of U.P. has the  authority to fix the State Advised Price (SAP) [hereinafter referred  to as “SAP”], which is required to be paid over and above the  minimum price fixed by the Central Government?   3.   At the outset it is required to be noted that in Tika Ramji case (supra), a Bench of five Judges of this Court held as under:          (i)     That, section 16 of the U.P. Sugarcane (Regulation of               Supply and Purchase) Act, 1953 [hereinafter referred               to as “1953 U.P. Act”] does not include the power to               fix a price;        (ii)    That, the price of cane fixed by the U.P. Government               only mean the price fixed by the appropriate               Government      which     would    be   the   Central               Government, under Clause 3 of the Sugarcane               (Control) Order, 1955 [hereinafter referred to as               “1955 Order”];         (iii)   That, even the provisions in behalf of the agreement                                                                  5                 contained in Clauses 3 and 4 of the U.P. Sugarcane             (Regulation of Supply and Purchase) Order, 1954             [hereinafter referred to as “1954 U.P. Order”] provided             that the price was to be the minimum price to be             notified by the Government subject to such             deduction, if any, as may be notified by the             Government from time to time, meaning thereby the             Central Government, the State Government not             having made any provision in that behalf at any time             whatsoever;       (iv)   That, there is no power to fix a price for sugarcane             under the U.P. Sugarcane Act or Rules and the             Orders made thereunder;        It is to be noted that in Tika Ramji case(supra), this  Court did not comment on whether a power which the State  Government exercised under Section 16 of the 1953 U.P. Act  would be repugnant to the Central legislation, since this Court  found no such power exercised by the State Government.   4.   However, subsequently, another five Judges Bench of this  Court in the case of U.P. Coop. Cane Unions Federations  (Supra) has specifically gone into the question of repugnancy  and held that the inconsistency or repugnancy will rise if the  State Government fixes a price which is lower than that fixed by  the Central Government. But, if the price fixed by the State                                                                      6     Government     is   higher   than   that   fixed   by   the   Central  Government, there will be no occasion for any inconsistency or  repugnancy as it is possible for both the orders to operate  simultaneously and to comply with both of them. A higher price  fixed by the State Government would automatically comply with  the provisions of clause 3(2) of 1966 Order. Therefore, any price  fixed by the State Government which is higher than that fixed by  the Central Government cannot lead to any kind of repugnancy.       In the case of U.P. Coop. Cane Unions Federations (Supra),  this Court held that the State Government has power to fix the  price which may be higher than the minimum price fixed by the  Central Government.       This Court in the reference order observed that to the  aforesaid extent there is a difference of opinion and/or conflict.   5.   We have called upon the learned Counsel appearing on  behalf of the respective parties to first address on whether in fact  there is any conflict between the decisions of this Court in the  case of Tika Ramji (Supra) and U.P. Coop. Cane Unions  Federations (Supra) or not and whether there is a need to refer                                                                   7     the matter to a larger Bench of seven Judges?  6.    Shri Jayant Bhushan, learned Senior Advocate appearing  on behalf of the appellants has submitted that this case raises  the following important issues.         (1)   Whether the State Government / Cane Commissioner             has any power or authority under the 1953 U.P. Act             or the Rules and the Orders made thereunder to fix             the sugarcane price?        (2)   If the State of U.P. had such a power, would such             legislation be repugnant to the Central legislation i.e.             Essential Commodities Act and the 1966 Order?         (3)   Whether there is any conflict between the             Constitution Bench judgment of this Court in the             case of Tika Ramji (Supra) and in the case of U.P.             Coop. Cane Unions Federations (Supra)?   6.1   So far as the question No.1 is concerned, it is submitted  that the power to regulate the distribution, sale or purchase of  cane under Section 16 of the 1953 U.P. Act does not include the  power to fix the price. It is submitted that this aspect has been  comprehensively dealt with in the case of Tika Ramji (Supra)  which analyzed the legislative history of laws relating to sugar  and sugarcane both Central and State and came to the specific                                                                 8     conclusion that the power reserved to the State Government to  fix the minimum price of sugarcane which existed in U.P. Act 1  of 1938 was deleted from the 1953 U.P. Act since that power was  being exercised by the Centre under Clause 3 of Sugar and Gur  Control Order, 1950. Reliance is placed upon paragraph 34 of  decision in the case of Tika Ramji (Supra).  6.1.1 It is submitted that in the aforesaid decision it has  specifically been held that the 1953 U.P. Act or the Rules and the  Orders made thereunder made no provision for fixation of price  of sugarcane whatsoever and therefore, there was no question of  repugnancy with the Central law. It is submitted that in the case  of U.P. Coop. Cane Unions Federations (Supra), this Court did  not quote paragraph 34 and relevant paragraphs of the decision  in the case of Tika Ramji (Supra) and erroneously holds that  Tika Ramji (Supra) only held that the State did not in fact  exercise the power to fix the price.   6.1.2 It is submitted that the argument that Tika Ramji  (Supra) only hold that the State Government did not fix the price                                                                     9     as this was fixed for the first time in 1973, is totally misplaced. It  is submitted that Tika Ramji case has specifically held that there  was no power to fix the price for sugarcane under the 1953 U.P.  Act or the Rules and the Orders made thereunder. It is  submitted that although the judgment in Tika Ramji (Supra)  does not specifically quote section 16 of the 1953 U.P. Act, it is  clear from the judgment that every section and every Rule was  examined to see whether there was any power to fix cane price or  any provision relating to price of cane. It is urged that the only  provision that was found on detailed scrutiny of the 1953 U.P.  Act and the Rules was Rule 94 which provided for a notice  showing the minimum price fixed by the Government, which was  held by the Constitution Bench to mean price fixed by the  Central Government.   6.2   Now, so far as question No.2 is concerned, it is argued that  even if such a power exists under Section 16 of the 1953 U.P.  Act, such power would be totally repugnant to the power of  Central Government to fix the minimum price under Clause 3 of  the 1955 Order and thereafter under 1966 Order. It is submitted                                                                 10     that although Tika Ramji case (supra) has not commented on  whether such a power with the State Government would be  repugnant to the Central Legislation, since it found no such  power exercised by the State Government, the majority in the  later Constitution Bench judgment in the case of U.P. Coop.  Cane Unions Federations (Supra) held that this would not be  repugnant to the Central Legislation. It is argued that basis for  holding that there is no repugnancy is that it is possible for both  the orders to operate simultaneously and to comply with both of  them. It is argued that in the case of U.P. Coop. Cane Unions  Federations (Supra), subsequently it is held that any price fixed  by the State Government which is higher than that fixed by the  Central Government cannot lead to any kind of repugnancy. It is  argued that this conclusion and its use for determining  repugnancy is incorrect and contrary to the earlier Constitution  Bench judgment including in the case of Tika Ramji (Supra). It  is argued that therefore this issue also needs to be referred to a  larger Bench to resolve the conflict. Reliance is placed on some of  the observations in the case of Tika Ramji (Supra); in the case                                                               11     of State of Orissa vs. M.A. Tulloch & Co. [1964 (4) SCR 461]  and in the case of M. Karunanidhi vs. Union of India [(1979)3  SCC 431].    6.2.1 It is argued that therefore there cannot be two minimum  prices, one fixed by the Central Government as minimum price  and other fixed by the State Government as SAP, which is also a  minimum price. It is submitted that once the Centre has fixed a  minimum price, any other price whether minimum price or SAP  would be repugnant to the Centre’s decision and the Centre’s  power and such power of the State Government would therefore  have to yield to the Central legislation under Article 254 of the  Constitution, both legislations being under the Concurrent List.    6.3   It is urged that there is a direct conflict between the  Constitution Bench Judgment of this Court in the case of Tika  Ramji (Supra) on one hand and the later Judgment also of the  Constitution Bench in the case of U.P. Coop. Cane Unions  Federations (Supra), which needs to be referred to the larger                                                              12     Bench of seven Judges.  7.   On the other hand, Shri Krishnan Venugopal, learned  Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the State of U.P. has  vehemently argued that as such there is no apparent conflict  between the two decisions of Constitution Bench of this Court in  the case of Tika Ramji (Supra) and U.P. Coop. Cane Unions  Federations (Supra). In support, he has made the following  submissions.         (1)   That, there is a sea change in the law prevailing and            considered by this Court in the case of Tika Ramji            (Supra) and thereafter in the case of U.P. Coop.            Cane Unions Federations (Supra);        (2)   That, by the time of the challenge to the 1953 U.P.            Act and the 1954 U.P. Order made under Section 16            of the 1953 U.P. Act in the U.P. Coop. Cane Unions            Federations (Supra), there was a fundamental            change in the substratum on which Tika Ramji case            was decided to the extent that the Central            Government had repealed and substituted the 1955            Order by the 1966 Order. The 1966 Order issued            under Section 3 of the Essential Commodities Act,            1955 expressly left room for the State to advise a            price higher than the minimum price fixed by the            Central Government under Clause 3(1) of the 1966            Order at which agreements for cane procurement            could be reached between farmers or cooperative                                                            13           societies, especially in the context of the reservation       of cane­growing areas for exclusive procurement by       sugar factories.   (3)   That, the ratio of Tika Ramji (Supra) is not premised       solely on the complete absence of power under the       1953 U.P. Act to fix prices. It is submitted that if so,       there was no need for this Court to hold premise its       reasoning on the “fact” that the State of U.P. had not       actually fixed the price for sugarcane.  (4)   That, in the case of Tika Ramji (Supra), though       there is a brief mention of section 16 of the impugned       1953 U.P. Act, neither was the issue raised and the       issue No.(iii) was whether section 16 of the Essential       Commodities Act read with clause 7 of 1955 Order       could have purported to repeal Section 16 of the 1953       U.P. Act and the 1954 U.P. Order in light of the       proviso to Article 254(2) of the Constitution of India,       neither was the issue raised nor was there any       argument or discussion on the effect or implications       of section 16 of the 1953 U.P. Act on the fixation of       the “minimum price” under the 1955 Order in the       context of the discussion of repugnancy of 1953 U.P.       Act.  (5)   That, there has been a sea change in the law relating       to repugnancy between Central law and State law in       the context of laws made under the Concurrent List,       List III in the VII Schedule to the Constitution of       India, where both, the Union and the States have       power to make law.  (6)   That, being fully aware of the judgment of this Court       in the case of Tika Ramji (Supra), the Central       Government retreated from the field of fixing “the       price” of sugarcane and only retain the power to fix       “the minimum price” while permitting an agreement                                                                   14                 for fixing higher price for sugarcane. It is submitted             that therefore, the Central Government left it open for             the State to fix the price above the minimum price for             purposes of the agreement to be reached between the             sugarcane growers and sugarcane cooperative             society, on the one hand, and the sugarcane             factories, on the other. It is submitted that therefore             the Central Government expressly indicated its intent             to vacate a particular portion of the field of price             fixation in relation to sugarcane and left it open to the             State, the doctrine of occupied field has no             application whatsoever.        (7)   It is submitted that the reliance placed upon the             decision of this Court in the case of M.A. Tulloch &             Co. (Supra) on the occupied field doctrine shall not             be applicable to the facts of the case on hand as that             case relates to regulation of mines and mineral             development and the regulation which involves the             relationship between the Entry 23 in List II and Entry             54 in List I of the Seventh Schedule, both of which             make it clear that the field of legislation can be taken             over by Parliament by making the declaration to that             effect.   7.1   Shri Venugopal, learned Senior Advocate appearing for the  respondent ­ State of U.P. has made following submissions in  support of his submission that there has been a fundamental  change in the provisions of the 1955 Order to the extent that it  was repealed by the 1966 Order.         (1)   That, Clause 3 of the 1955 Order empowered the             Central Government to fix “the price or the minimum                                                                15                 price” to be paid by a producer of sugar for sugarcane             purchased by him. The 1955 Order has been repealed             by the 1966 Order and clause 3 of the 1966 Order             provides that the Central Government may fix “the             minimum price” of sugarcane to be paid by producers             of sugar.        (2)   That, there is a difference between “the price” which             is a fixed amount and “the minimum price” which             only indicates the lowest­permissible rate. The 1966             Order was further amended in 1976 and 1978 and             clauses 3(3) and 3­A were introduced, which now             contemplated an “agreed price”. In view of the             prohibition in clause 3(2) on transacting below the             minimum price, the “agreed price” necessarily had to             be higher than the “minimum price” fixed under             clause 3(1).        (3)   That, it is evident from the amended provisions of the             1966 Order, as amended in 1976 and again in 1978,             that the Central Government intentionally vacated             space in favour of the State Legislature to regulate             the price at which agreements could be reached             between sugarcane farmers and cooperative societies             of sugarcane farmers for procurement of sugarcane,             especially in the context of reservation of areas for             procurement by sugar factories.        (4)   That, therefore, it is clear that as long as the State             Advised Price fixed by the State Government of Uttar             Pradesh by exercising powers under Section 16 of the             1953 U.P. Act remains over and above the minimum             price fixed by the Central legislature under the 1966             Order, there is no repugnancy to the extent that both             laws can be obeyed without infringing the other.   7.2   It is further argued that in the case of U.P. Coop. Cane                                                                    16     Unions Federations (Supra), this Court has rightly observed  and held that so long both, the Union law and the State law can  be obeyed, the State law does not become repugnant to the  Union law when both the laws can operate in the same field  without conflict. In support, heavy reliance has been placed  upon the decision of this Court in the case of Dr. Preeti  Srivastava vs. State of M.P. [(1999) 7 SCC 120].    7.3     It is further argued that in the case of M. Karunanidhi  (Supra), while examining the issue of repugnancy with respect to  State    enactment    of   Tamil   Nadu    Public   Men     (Criminal  Misconduct) Act, 1973 in light of the Central enactments of  Indian Penal Code, 1860, Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and  the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1952 and after considering  the relevant Entries in List I, List II and Concurrent List – List III  and Article 254 of the Constitution of India, it is held that so far  as Clause (1) of Article 254 is concerned, it clearly lays down that  where there is a direct collision between a provision of a law  made by the State and that made by the Parliament with respect                                                                 17     to one of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent List, then,  subject to the provisions of clause (2), the State law would be  void to the extent of the repugnancy. It is submitted that it is  further held that so far as the Concurrent List is concerned,  both, Parliament and the State Legislatures are entitled to  legislate in regard to any of the Entries appearing therein, but  that is subject to the condition laid down by Article 254(1). It is  submitted that in the aforesaid decision it is held that (1)Where  the provisions of a Central Act and a State Act in the Concurrent  List are fully inconsistent and are absolutely irreconcilable, the  Central Act will prevail and the State Act will become void in view  of the repugnancy; (2) Where, however a law passed by the State  comes into collision with a law passed by the Parliament on an  Entry in the Concurrent List, the State Act shall prevail to the  extent of the repugnancy and the provisions of the Central Act  would become void provided the State Act has been passed in  accordance with clause (2) of Article 254; (3) Where, a law passed  by the State Legislature while being substantially within the  scope of the entries in the State List entrenches upon any of the  Entries in the Central List the constitutionality of the law may be                                                                18     upheld by invoking the doctrine of pith and substance if on an  analysis of the provisions of the Act it appears that by and large  the law falls within the four corners of the State List an  entrenchment, if any, is purely incidental or inconsequential; (4)  Where, however, a law made by the State Legislature on a  subject covered by the Concurrent List is inconsistent with and  repugnant to a previous law made by Parliament, then such a  law can be protected by obtaining the assent of the President  under Article 254(2) of the Constitution. The result of obtaining  the assent of the President would be that so far as the State Act  is concerned, it will prevail in the State and overrule the  provisions of the Central Act in their applicability to the State  only. Such a state of affairs will exist only until Parliament may  at any time make a law adding to, or amending, varying or  repealing the law made by the State Legislature under the  proviso to Article 254.    7.4   It is submitted that therefore applying the law laid down by  this Court in the case of M. Karunanidhi (Supra) to the facts of  the case on hand, it is clear that in the present case, as the                                                                   19     Essential Commodities Act and the 1966 Order, on the one  hand, and 1953 U.P. Act and the 1954 U.P. Order, have both  been enacted under the Concurrent List, and there is no direct  conflict between the fixation of the minimum price by the Central  Government under Clause 3 of the 1955 Order and the fixation  of a higher SAP by the State of U.P., there is no real and  irreconcilable conflict between the provisions of the two Acts to  the extent that both can be obeyed without violating the order.        Therefore, it is submitted that the decision of this Court in  the case of U.P. Coop. Cane Unions Federations (Supra) must  be upheld as there is no conflict with the decision in the case of  Tika Ramji (Supra).   8.   While considering whether there is any apparent conflict  between the decisions of the Constitution Bench of this Court in  the case of Tika Ramji (Supra) and U.P. Coop. Cane Unions  Federations (Supra) and whether the matter requires to be  referred to the larger Bench of seven Judges, the legislative  history as well as the chronology of lists and events which led to                                                                20     the controversy in the case of Tika Ramji (Supra) and U.P.  Coop. Cane Unions Federations (Supra) and the relevant  provisions which fell for consideration before this Court are  required to be referred to, which are noted in U.P. Coop. Cane  Unions Federations (Supra) , as under:         a.   On 8th April, 1932, the Central Legislature, in the           then British India, passed the Sugar Industry           (Protection) Act, 1932 [Act 13 of 1932] to provide for           the fostering and development of Sugar Industry in           India. This led to a large number of farmers taking up           sugarcane cultivation and the establishment of a           number of sugar factories coming up, particularly in           the then Province of U.P. To protect the interest of the           sugarcane­growers', and for the purpose of assuring           them a fair price, the Central Legislature enacted on           1st May, 1934 the Sugarcane Act, 1934, 1934 [Act 15           of 1934] to regulate the price at which sugarcane           intended for manufacture of sugar could be           purchased by or for the factories. Since, sugarcane           was grown in various Provinces and the Sugarcane           Act, 1934 left the declaration of controlled areas and           the fixing of minimum price for the purchase of           sugarcane in any controlled area to the discretion of           the    Provincial     Governments,     the   Provincial           Governments were also empowered to make rules for           the purpose of carrying into effect the objects of the           Act.        b.   As a result of the Government of India Act, 1935,           there was a distribution of legislative powers between                                                            21          the Dominion Legislature and the Provincial      Legislatures. Consequently, the entire subject matter      of Act 15 of 1934 fell within the Provincial Legislative      List. It was felt that Act 15 of 1934 was not      sufficiently comprehensive for dealing with the      problems of the sugar industry. The Governments of      U.P. and Bihar decided to introduce legislation on      similar lines in both the provinces since, between      them, they accounted for nearly 85% of production of      sugar in India.  c.   The U.P. Legislature enacted on 10th February, 1938      the U.P. Sugar Factories Control Act, 1938 [U.P. Act I      of 1938]. This Act provided for (i) licensing of sugar      factories, (ii) regulation of the supply of sugarcane      intended for use in such factories, (iii) the minimum      price for sugarcane, (iv) the establishment of Sugar      Control Board and Advisory Committee, and (v) a tax      on the sale of sugarcane intended for use in factories.      Though this Act was to remain in force initially until      30th June, 1947, its life was extended from time to      time and finally up to 30th June 1952. Parallel      developments during this period were the outbreak of      the Second World War and the legislative measures      taken to meet the situation by the then Government      of India for controlling the production, regulation of      distribution and supply of essential commodities. The      Dominion Legislature acquired the power to make      laws for the Provinces with respect to any of the      matters enumerated in the Provincial Legislative List.      Under the Defence of India Act, sugar was made a      controlled commodity in the year 1942 and its      production and distribution as well as the fixation of      sugar prices were regulated by the Sugar Controller.      The proclamation of emergency was revoked by the      Governor General on 1st April 1946. Simultaneously,      the laws made by the Dominion Legislature in the      field of the Provincial Legislative List were to cease to                                                          22          be effective after 30th September 1946.   d.   On 26th March 1946, the British Parliament enacted      the India (Central Government and Legislature) Act,      1946 [9 & 10 Geo.6, Chapter 39] which provided that,      notwithstanding anything in the Government of India      Act, 1935, the Indian Legislature shall during the      periods specified in Section 4 of the Act have the      power to make laws with respect, inter alia, to      “foodstuffs”. Though the period provided in Section 4      was one year from the expiration of the declaration of      the emergency by the Governor General, this period      was extended from time to time and would have      ended on 31st March 1948. e.   On 18th July 1947, the Indian Independence Act came      to be passed leading to the Indian (Central      Government and Legislature) Act, 1946 which by way      of adaptation provided that the powers of the      Dominion Legislature shall be exercised by the      Constituent Assembly.

The correct interpretation of Section 24 of the Right to Fair  Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation  and Resettlement Act, 2013 (for short, 'the Act of 2013'), is the subject  matter of reference to this five Judge Bench of this Court.   2.    A three Judge Bench of this Court in Pune Municipal Corporation  & Anr v Harakchand Misrimal Solanki & Ors 1, interpreted Section 24 of  the Act of 2013. The order reported as Yogesh Neema & Ors v State of  Madhya Pradesh2, a two-judge Bench, however doubted the decision in  Sree Balaji Nagar Residents Association v State of Tamil Nadu 3 (which  had followed Pune Municipal Corporation (supra) and also held that  Section 24 (2) of the Act of 2013 does not exclude any period during  which the land acquisition proceeding might have remained stayed on  account of stay or injunction granted by any court) and referred the  issue to a larger Bench. Later, in another appeal (arising out of S.L.P.  (C) No.2131 of 2016 (Indore Development Authority v Shailendra (dead)  through Lrs. & Ors.4) the matter was referred to a larger Bench on  7.12.2017; the Court noticed that:             “cases which have been concluded are being revived. In spite of           not accepting the compensation deliberately and statement are           made in the Court that they do not want to receive the           compensation at any cost, and they are agitating the matter time  1  (2014) 3 SCC 183 2 (2016) 6 SCC 387 3 (2015) 3 SCC 353 4 2018 SCC Online SC 100                                          4           and again after having lost the matters and when proceedings          are kept pending by interim orders by filing successive petitions,          the provisions of section 24 cannot be invoked by such          landowners.”  3.   The Court noticed that the reference to a larger Bench was  pending, and had been made in Yogesh Neema (supra). The Court also  felt that several other issues arose which it outlined, but were not  considered in Pune Municipal Corporation (supra). The Court therefore,  stated that the matter should be considered by a larger Bench and  referred the case to Hon’ble the Chief Justice of India for appropriate  orders. Indore Development Authority v Shailendra (hereafter, “IDA v  Shailendra”) a Bench of three Judges was of the view that the judgment  in Pune Municipal Corporation (supra) did not consider several aspects  relating to the interpretation of Section 24 of the Act of 2013. Since Pune  Municipal Corporation (supra) was a judgment by a Bench of coordinate  strength, two learned judges in IDA v Shailendra opined prima facie that  decision appeared to be per incuriam.  4.   Later, in Indore Development Authority v Shyam Verma & Ors (SLP  No. 9798 of 2016) considered it appropriate to refer the matter to  Hon’ble the Chief Justice of India to refer the issues to be resolved by a  larger Bench at the earliest. Yet again in State of Haryana v Maharana  Pratap Charitable Trust (Regd) & Anr (CA No.4835 of 2015) referred the  matter to Hon’ble the Chief Justice of India to constitute an appropriate  Bench for consideration of the larger issue. These batch appeals were  referred to a five Judge Bench, which after hearing counsel, framed the  following questions, which arise for consideration:                                           5           “1. What is the meaning of the expression paid'/tender' in Section          24 of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land          Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 (Act of          2013') and Section 31 of the Land Acquisition Act, LA (Act of          1894')? Whether non-deposit of compensation in court under          section 31(2) of the Act of 1894 results into lapse of acquisition          under section 24(2) of the Act of 2013. What are the consequences          of non- deposit in Court especially when compensation has been          tendered and refused under section 31(1) of the Act of 1894 and          section 24(2) of the Act of 2013? Whether such persons after          refusal can take advantage of their wrong/conduct?           2. Whether the word or' should be read as conjunctive or          disjunctive in Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013?           3. What is the true effect of the proviso, does it form part of sub-          Section (2) or main Section 24 of the Act of 2013?           4. What is mode of taking possession under the Land Acquisition          Act and true meaning of expression the physical possession of          the land has not been taken occurring in Section 24(2) of the Act          of 2013?           5. Whether the period covered by an interim order of a Court          concerning land acquisition proceedings ought to be excluded for          the purpose of applicability of Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013 ?           6. Whether Section 24 of the Act of 2013 revives barred and stale          claims? In addition, question of per incuriam and other incidental          questions also to be gone into.”  5.    Question nos.1 to 3 are interconnected and concern the correct  interpretation of Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013. Following questions  are required to be gone into to interpret the provisions of Section 24(2)  of the Act of 2013:   (i)   Whether the word “or” in Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013 used in  between possession has not been taken or compensation has not been  paid to be read as “and”?  (ii) Whether proviso to Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013 has to be  construed as part thereof or proviso to Section 24(1)(b)?                                       6  (iii)   What meaning is to be given to the word ""paid"" used in Section  24(2) and ""deposited"" used in the proviso to Section 24(2)?  (iv)    What are the consequences of payment not made?  (v)     What are the consequences of the amount not deposited?  (vi)    What is the effect of a person refusing to accept the compensation?   6.      The Act of 2013 repeals and replaces the Land Acquisition Act,  1894, a general law for acquisition of land of public purposes, which  had been in force for almost 120 years, with a view to address certain  inadequacies and/ or shortcomings in the said Act.   7.      The Act of 2013 is prospective and saves proceedings already  initiated under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 before its repeal, subject  to provisions of Section 24 of the Act of 2013, which begins with a non-  obstante clause and overrides all other provisions of the Act of 2013.   8.      On behalf of the Union, the States and various acquiring bodies  and development authorities, Mr. Tushar Mehta, learned Solicitor  General (who led the arguments, hereafter “SG”), Ms. Pinky Anand,  learned Additional Solicitor General (hereafter “ASG”), Mr. Anoop  Chaudhary and Mr. Jayant Muthuraj, learned Senior Counsel, Ms.  Shashi Kiran, Ms. Rachna Srivastava, Mr. R.M. Bhangade and Mr.  Rajesh Mahale, learned counsel, made their submissions.   9.      The learned SG, arguing that this Court should overrule the ratio  in Pune Municipal Corporation (supra) and other judgments which                                       7  followed it, contended that the Court did not consider the various  interpretations of Section 31 of the (repealed) Land Acquisition Act, (“LA  Act” hereafter). He urged that the provisions of the Act of 2013, vis-à-  vis the timelines and consequences that would ensue if the acquisition  proceeding prolongs, were not examined. He highlighted that Section 24  is a transitional provision and such provisions should be given an  interpretation which accords with legislative intent, rather than so as to  impose   hitherto     absent   standards,   upon   past   proceedings,    or  proceedings initiated under the previous regime, but which have not  worked themselves out. He urged that there is a presumption in favour  of restricted retrospective applicability of any provision in an enactment  unless a contrary intention appears. It is submitted that designedly, it  is the stage of passing of award under Section 11 of the LA Act, that  represents the determinative factor in the segregation for the  applicability of the provisions of the Act of 2013 or the LA Act. It is urged  that the opening part of the provision in Section 24(1) is a non-obstante  clause providing for a limited overriding effect of the Land Acquisition  Act, in case of the contingencies mentioned in Section 24 (1) (a) and (b)  of the Act of 2013.   10.   Section 24 (1) (a) contemplates that where no award under Section  11 of the LA Act has been made, but proceedings had been initiated  under said Act, provisions of the Act of 2013 would apply limited to the  determination of compensation. In other words, the entire exercise de                                        8  novo, under the Act of 2013, will not be required to be undertaken.  Therefore, Section 24 (1) (a) contemplates a limited applicability of the  Act of 2013. Section 24 (1) (b) stipulates that where an award under  Section 11 of the LA Act has been made, the entire proceedings would  continue under that law and the provisions of the Act of 2013 would be  inapplicable. Section 24 (1) (b) is the larger umbrella clause under  Section 24, which protects the vested rights of the parties under the LA  Act if the stage of passing of award has been crossed. It is argued that  the umbrella clause Section 24 (1) (b), is followed by Section 24(2) -  which provides for the exclusionary clause. Section 24 (2), the learned  SG highlighted, is the only lapsing clause under the provision which  brings in the rigours of the Act of 2013 in totality by mandating the land  acquisition to be initiated de novo.   11.   It is urged that Section 24 (2) opens with a non obstante clause  carving out an exception only from Section 24 (1). It visualizes that land  acquisition proceedings which had been initiated under the LA Act, an  award under Section 11 of the LA Act had been made. Consequently,  Section 24 (2) has no relation to Section 24 (1) (a) as it does not  contemplate an award under Section 11 of the LA Act at all. It is,  therefore, a limited exception to Section 24 (1) (b). Section 24 (2)  consequently is umbilically related to Section 24 (1) (b) as an exception,  wherein   land   acquisition   proceedings    would   lapse   in   certain                                      9  contingencies even when an award under Section 11 of the LA Act had  been made.   12.   It is submitted that the contingencies for lapsing in Section 24(2),  are subject to an award under Section 11 of the LA Act being made five  years prior to the commencement of the Act of 2013 (which is 1.1.2014).  If the award is so made, two contingencies result in complete lapse -: (a)  Physical possession of the land has not been taken; or (b) compensation  has not been “paid”. The provision for lapse, per Section 24(2) is, by its  nature, a vital provision, inviting serious consequences, in case those  contingencies arise. It is the interpretation of these “contingencies” that  requires further consideration. The “contingencies” ought to be  interpreted in a manner which saves the past transactions to the extent  they can be saved as it is clearly not the intention of the Act of 2013 to  tide over all past transactions.   13.   The learned SG argued that the proviso to Section 24(2) further  carves out an exception to Section 24(2) viz, in case the award has been  made and compensation in respect of majority of landholdings has not  been deposited in the account of the beneficiaries, no lapsing will take  place, but all the beneficiaries specified in the notification for  acquisition shall be entitled to compensation in accordance with the  provisions of the Act of 2013.                                     10  14.   Therefore, if only a minority of the claimants are disbursed with  the compensation, such claimants would get benefit of compensation  under the Act of 2013 to a limited extent without lapsing. Thus, it is  clear that even if the acquisition does not lapse, all the beneficiaries to  whom the compensation is payable would be entitled to compensation  under the Act of 2013.   15.   It is submitted that Section 24(1)(a) and Section 24(2) are  balancing provisions controlling the extent of retrospectivity and  curtailing the effacement of rights. Such balance of protecting  acquisitions under the LA Act in some defined circumstances whilst  providing the enhanced compensation provisions under the Act of 2013  under some defined circumstances is the “middle path” that Parliament  adopted. It is contended that Section 24(2) is, therefore, controlled by  the proviso mandating again a further middle path consciously chosen  by Parliament.   16.   It is argued that while providing for a transitory provision or  situations resulting into “lapsing” of all the steps already taken under  the Act under repeal, the legislature always envisages several  contingencies which emerge out of its day-to-day experience.           The  manner in which section 24[2] and the proviso attached therewith are  drafted clearly discloses that Parliament intended certain inevitable  contingencies which frequently arose in land acquisition proceedings.  It was urged illustratively, that often, land acquired belongs to benami                                      11  owners, who cannot put forward title, or claim compensation or identify  themselves. In such situations, it may not be possible for an acquiring  authority to “pay” [which, as plain language indicates, would mean  setting apart for being taken by the entitled persons as explained  hereafter] to “all” land holders/ entitled persons. However, as is clear  from the proviso to Section 24[2], if it can be shown that the amount is  deposited for majority of share-holding, the acquisition would be saved  and cannot lapse; the only consequence would be the determination of  benefits under the Act of 2013. Parliamentary intent in the proviso  clearly appears to be to ascertain the stage up to which the land  acquisition proceedings under LA Act have reached. If nobody is paid  the compensation or compensation is not taken by everyone though  tendered and/or kept ready, the legislature contemplates such a  situation to be a reversible one and, therefore, provides for lapsing of all  previous stages prior to “non-payment”. However, if it can be  demonstrated that though - (1) compensation was tendered to all; (2)  some of them [for whatever reason] did not take the compensation; and  (3) compensation is deposited in case of majority of the land holdings  [viz. setting apart the share of such persons and making it available for  them to take it], then, neither proceedings would lapse nor the  compensation will be required to be determined under the Act of 2013.  In substance, therefore, the legal situation would be akin to the one  contemplated under Section 24[1][b] for all practical purposes.                                     12  17.   It is submitted that during the drafting of the Bill, the legislative  intent and the apprehensions of the stakeholders in the acquisition  process is clearly depicted in 31st Report of the ‘Standing Committee on  Rural Development’ while discussing the ‘The Land Acquisition,  Rehabilitation and Resettlement Bill, 2011’ which was the precursor to  the Act of 2013. The learned SG relied on extracts of the Standing  Committee Reports, the draft Bill, various comments from government  and public agencies and departments and other stakeholders, the  stage(s) during which amendments were proposed to the draft  provisions (of Section 24) and its culmination into the present form and  structure.   18.   The learned SG argued that the amendments proposed by the  Minister while introducing the Bill - to incorporate an explanation, as  to what constitutes “deposit” was not accepted in the legislative wisdom  of the Lok Sabha and the Bill so passed consciously did not incorporate  the Explanation (in the form of Proviso to Section 24(2)) providing for an  extensive and artificial meaning of the word paid. Further, reference to  “bank” account was also consciously not incorporated thereby leaving  the expression “to pay” and ""to deposit"" with its natural meaning and  leaving it to the discretion of the acquiring authorities to deposit the  compensation amount even in the treasury.         It is possible that the  legislature may have considered the reality of 2012-13 where crores of  people did not have bank accounts. It was also urged that the rejection                                      13  of the amendment is in consonance with the apprehensions expressed  by other stakeholders and ministries at the said time. After the said Bill  was passed in the Lok Sabha, amendments were proposed and accepted  by the Rajya Sabha, giving the provision its final form. Further, it is  clear that the effort at the time was towards the drafting of a balancing  provision which protects the acquisitions from lapsing and at the same  time provides enhanced compensation under the new Act depending  upon the stage up to which the acquisition has progressed. This was  the genesis behind Section 24(1)(a) and proviso to Section 24(2) which  protect    acquisitions   from   lapsing   whilst     providing   for   higher  compensation under the Act of 2013 to the land owners under limited  defined circumstances. It is submitted that it is necessary to read the  proviso to Section 24(2) along with the same provision and not Section  24(1)(b) as the former would be in accord with Parliamentary intent.   19.   It   was   submitted   that   Section   24(2)    intended    a    limited  retrospective operation: yet such retrospectivity operated and has to be  construed narrowly considering the nature and width of Section 24(2)  and the drastic consequences flowing from it. It is submitted that the  field of retrospectivity to be given under Section 24 needs to be  considered in the context of legislative intention manifested from  Section 114 of the Act of 2013 and Section 6 of the General Clauses Act,  1897. Both Section 114 (of the Act of 2013) and Section 6 of the 1897  Act clearly point to a narrow interpretation of Section 24 with the object                                                   14  of saving on-going acquisition proceedings as far as possible.                                 The  learned SG referred to the provisions of UK’s Interpretation Act, 1978;  he also relied on Bennion’s Statutory Interpretation Bennion’s Fifth  Edition, (2012) Indian Reprint, which reads as under:                 “Where, on a weighing of the factors, it seems that some                retrospective effect was intended, the general presumption                against retrospectively indicates that this should be kept to as                narrow a compass as will accord with the legislative intention”   20.       Reliance was placed on Secretary of State for Social Security v  Tunnicliffe5, to the effect that:                 “Parliament is presumed not to have intended to alter the law                applicable to past events and transactions in a manner which is                unfair to those concerned in them, unless a contrary intention                appears”.             The learned SG also referred to the later judgment of the House of  Lords which dealt with the said question. It is submitted that sitting in  a combination of eight judges, in Yamashita-Shinnihon Steamship Co.  Ltd.v L'office Chefifien Des Phosphates & Anr 6, where it was held that  retrospective application of a statute can be made only when it does not   5     [1991] 2 All ER 712 6      [1994] 1 A.C. 486, where it was held that:           ""The rule that a person should not be held liable or punished for conduct not           criminal when committed is fundamental and of long standing. It is reflected in the           maxim nullum crimen nulla poena sine lege. It is protected by article 7 of the           European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental           Freedoms (1953) (Cmd. 8969). The rule also applies, but with less force,           outside the criminal sphere. It is again expressed in maxims, lex prospicit non           respicit and omnis nova constitutio futuris temporibus formam imponere debet non           praeteritis. The French Civil Code provides that “La loi ne dispose que pour l'avenir;           elle n'a point d'effet retroactif:”                                                        …..           But both these passages draw attention to an important point, that the exception only           applies where application of it would not cause unfairness or injustice. This is consistent           with the general rule or presumption which is itself based on considerations of fairness           and justice, as shown by the passage in Maxwell quoted, ante, p. 494C–E, and recently           emphasised by Staughton L.J in Secretary of State for Social Security v. Tunnicliffe           [1991] 2 All E.R 712, 724..”                                      15  visit anyone with unfairness. The learned SG referred to Zile Singh v.  State of Haryana7 where a three-judge Bench held that retrospectivity  should not be presumed to have been given to a provision, unless it says  so clearly, or through necessary implication. The guidance was given to  construe provisions for determining whether such intention is  expressed, in a given case.    21.      It was urged that this Court, after assessing the unintended and  absurd results that an amendment may result in, purposefully  interpreted the provisions to be prospective in operation. It was also  emphasized that Section 24(2) is retrospective in nature and cannot be  held to be prospective; nevertheless, the extent of retrospectivity ought  to be narrowly construed while interpreting, given the harsh  consequences that it results in particularly against projects of public  interest. Reliance was placed on CIT v. Sarkar Builders8.   22.      It is submitted that apart from the above, this Court has  consistently ruled on principles guiding the retrospective operation of  statutes. Though there is no bar against retrospective operation yet this  Court considered the practical realities before analysing the extent of  retrospective operation of the statutes. Reliance in this regard is placed     7   (2004) 8 SCC 01 8     2015 (7) SCC 579                                         16  on Jawaharmal v. State of Rajasthan9 and Rai Ramkrishna v. State of  Bihar10.   23.      The learned SG next submitted that a spate of decisions of this  Court had followed the ratio in Pune Municipal Corporation (supra).  Emphasizing that the overall interpretation of Section 24 of the Act of  2013 has to accord with its scheme, it was stated that the object of that  provision was not only to declare that certain acquisitions lapsed.  Learned counsel, in this context, highlighted that Section 24 (1) (a) in  fact saves acquisition proceedings, where awards were not made before  the advent of the Act of 2013, by declaring that the award would be  made under that Act and compensation payable, in accordance with its  provisions. Section 24 (1) (b) on the other hand contemplates making of  award, under the old (LA) Act, but significantly states that all further  “proceedings” after the award would be taken under the new Act. It was  highlighted        here,   that   Parliament   clearly   intended   that   the  compensation determined under the old Act had to be paid in terms of  the new Act, which is under Section 77. The learned SG submitted that  given these aspects, which are expressed in Section 24 (1), the non  obstante clause and the following provisions of Section 24 (2) have to be  interpreted contextually, and in a purposive manner. It was submitted  that Parliament did not intend that settled matters should be undone,  and whatever had attained finality, in acquisition matters, should not   9    1966 (1) SCR 890 10   1964 (1) SCR 897                                       17  be re-opened. He cited the decisions of this Court reported as Southern  Electricity Supply Co. of Orissa Ltd. v. Sri Seetaram Rice Mill11; Tinsukhia  Electric Supply Company Ltd v. State Of Assam & Ors12; Commissioner  of Income Tax v. Hindustan Bulk Carriers13; D. Saibaba v. Bar Council of  India & Ors14; Balram Kamanat v. Union of India15; New India Assurance  Co. v.

Ajoy Khose & Ors19; H.S Vankani v.  State of Gujarat,20; State of Madhya Pradesh v. Narmada Bachao  Andolan & Ors.21   24.        It was submitted that hitherto, in accord with Pune Municipal  Corporation (supra) and Balaji Nagar Residential Assn. v. State of Tamil  Nadu22 most decisions had accepted that the expression “or”- (occurring  in Section 24 (2)), where an award has been made under the old Act, 5  years before the commencement of the Act of 2013 “but the physical  possession of the land has not been taken or the compensation has not  been paid” – is to be read disjunctively, i.e., that if either condition is    11    (2012) 2 SCC 108 12    (1989) 3 SCC 709 @ para 118-121 13    (2003) 3 SCC 57 @ para 14-21 14    (2003) 6 SCC 186 para 16-18 15      (2003) 7 SCC 628 para 24 16      (2008) 3 SCC 279 @ para 51-54 17    (2008) 4 SCC 720 para 41 & 42 18    (2008) 13 SCC 30 para 132-137 19    (2009) 7 SCC 1 para 54-67 20     (2010) 4 SCC 301 para 43-48 21    (2011) 7 SCC 639 para 78-85 22      2015 (3) SCC 353                                    18  satisfied, the acquisition would lapse. However, submitted the learned  SG, the true and correct interpretation of the term “or” would be that it  ought to be construed as a conjunctive word.   25.   Learned counsel next submitted that the expression “paid” should  be construed reasonably and not in a literal manner, as was done in  Pune Municipal Corporation (supra). Before the Act of 2013 was brought  into force, the modes of payment recognized by the law were: tendering  payment, payment into court in the event no one entitled to alienate the  property received it and payment into court upon disputes about the  entitlement to receive payment. These three situations were visualized  in Section 31 (2) of the old Act. It was emphasized that the consequence  of lapse of acquisition was never contemplated, in the event of refusal  to accept payment, or absence of anyone entitled to receive it, or in the  contingency of a dispute regarding entitlement to receive the amount.  This clearly meant that while payment of compensation was essential  and mandatory, the mode of payment was not mandatory. If, for  instance, the amount was tendered and not received, but instead, the  landowner refused it, the appropriate government could well deposit it  in the treasury, in accordance with prevailing financial rules, to  facilitate disbursement, as and when the landowner or the one entitled  to receive it, came forward and established entitlement. In such event,  the only consequence of non-deposit (in court, under Section 31) meant  that higher interest as mandated by Section 34 was to be paid.                                    19   26.   The context of Section 24, learned counsel urged, is to provide for  a transitory provision viz. to take care of the pending land acquisition  proceedings which are ongoing under the LA Act when the Act of 2013  is brought into force w.e.f. 1.1.2014. The purpose and object of making  this provision is to balance the competing rights of public projects vis-  à-vis holders of the land. The object and purpose was to ensure that  where acquisition proceedings under LA Act have reached an advanced  stage and investment of public money had already been made, firstly,  the lapsing of such ongoing projects should be avoided and secondly as  far as possible, the land owners also can, without disturbing the process  of acquisition, be given the compensation under the Act of 2013.   27.   It was reiterated that the legislature knows about the ground  realities faced in land acquisition proceedings. There are very few cases  where one or two land parcels are acquired in isolation.         Mostly,  acquisitions take place of bigger tracts of land involving more than one  parcel of land and more than one person “entitled to compensation”.  When Parliament provided for a transitory provision in relation to  acquisitions under the old Act, it did not contemplate the possibility of  the entire payment procedure to all being not processed given the  practical situations arising in all such proceedings. Parliament is also  presumed to be aware of the fact that in almost all cases of acquisition,  the proceedings are stiffly opposed and in most of the cases, the tender  of compensation is also opposed under a wrong and misplaced notion                                     20  that the acceptance of the tender may be treated as acquiescence with  the quantum being tendered.   28.   The learned counsel argued that Parliament did not expect the  acquiring authority to perform an impossible task of forcing payment to  the land owners unwilling, for any reason to accept it. The legislature,  therefore, does not use the expression of the land owners having  “accepted” the payment. It merely uses the expression “paid”.          The  legislature clearly tries to balance the rights of land owners only in one  contingency viz. in a post award scenario and the award having been  made five years prior to 1.1.2014, when the amount is not “deposited”  in "

The deceased – Satpal Singh was residing in Doha, Qatar       since 1984. The Employment Contract Form of the deceased       dated 21.08.1984 revealed that he was engaged as a labourer       initially for a period of one year on a salary of 750 Qatari       Riyal p.m., and continued to live in Qatar where he was       employed, till he passed away in a motor vehicle accident in       India in 1998.   2.   Satpal Singh was visiting India in November, 1998. On       18.11.1998, he was riding a scooter, with his wife as the       pillion rider, when he met with an accident with a Maruti car       bearing      No.   CH-01-M-6284   coming   from   the   opposite       direction.           FIR No. 204 dated 18.11.1998 was lodged u/S. 304A,       279, 337, 427 IPC at P.S. Sadar, Rajpura against the driver       and owner of the offending car.           The FIR was lodged on the statement of Satinder Kaur –       widow of the deceased, wherein she had stated that the       accident had occurred due to the rash and negligent driving       of the driver of the Maruti car. It was further stated that the       accident took place while her husband was over-taking a       tractor-trolley, when the Maruti car was coming at a high                                    2      speed from the opposite side. This led to the accident, and       caused the death of Satpal Singh on the spot.              The Claimant No. 1 i.e. wife of the deceased was also       seriously injured. Her right leg and jaw were fractured. The       Claimant No. 1 remained in hospital for over a month. A rod       was inserted in her leg, and remained in plaster for about 7       to 8 months. The accident led to 25% permanent disability,       which is borne out from the Disability Certificate issued by       the Civil Surgeon, Patiala.   3.   Claim Petition bearing M.A.C. Application No. 152 was filed       before the MACT, Patiala (Punjab) on 24.12.1998 u/S. 166 of       the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 by the widow of the deceased,       on     behalf   of   herself   and   her   3   minor   children   for       compensation on the death of her husband. The Claimants       prayed for compensation of Rs. 50 lacs, alongwith Interest       @18% p.a. to be paid jointly and severally by the Insurance       Company, and the driver and owner of the Maruti car.       3.1.    A copy of the FIR was placed before the MACT, as also               the Post Mortem Report which recorded the serious               head injuries caused by the road accident on the               deceased.                                       3 3.2.   The Claimants filed a photocopy of the Employment         Contract Form dated 10.07.1984 certified by the         Indian   Embassy     at   Doha,     which   records      the         engagement of the deceased as a labourer by the firm         Ali Al Fayyad Trading Contracting Est., Doha on a         salary of 750 Qatari Riyal p.m., when he first shifted to         Qatar.  3.3.   The Claimants also placed on record a letter dated         27.06.1997 purported to have been issued by his         employer – the High Speed Group to the Counsellor,         New Zealand Consulate for issuance of a visa. It was         stated that the General Manager of their company, Mr.         Satpal Harbans Singh was intending to spend his         annual vacation during June – August 1997 in New         Zealand, and had been employed by this organization         since 1984, and was now drawing a salary of $ 6,700         p.m.             It is relevant to note that this letter was not         attested by the Indian Embassy at Doha.  3.4.   The Claimants placed on record the Passport of the         deceased,   which   reveals   his    date   of   birth   as                                4             10.08.1958. The deceased was a little over 40 years of              age at the time of the accident.                  The passport entries reveal frequent foreign travel              during the period 1986 till 1998 when he expired.   4.   The MACT vide Award dated 30.03.2001 held that a perusal       of the first statement made by Claimant No. 1 – widow of the       deceased in the FIR, revealed that her husband was over-       taking a tractor–trolley when the accident occurred, because       the Maruti car was coming at a high speed from the opposite       side. Consequently, the MACT held that it was a case of       contributory negligence on the part of the deceased Satpal       Singh, as also on the part of the driver of the Maruti car.       4.1.   The MACT applied the multiplier of 13, since the              deceased was a little over 40 years of age at the time of              his death.       4.2.   With respect to the income of the deceased, the MACT              held that the letter dated 27.06.1997 issued by the              High Speed Group, had not been proved by the              Claimants, nor was it attested by the Indian Embassy              at Doha, and therefore refused to take it into              consideration.                                    5      4.3.   The MACT assumed that the income of the deceased              Satpal Singh should be assessed just as an ordinary              skilled worker, and assessed his income at Rs. 4,000              p.m. The amount of dependency was taken as Rs.              2,500 p.m. x 12 x 13 = Rs. 3.90 lacs. Since it was a              case of contributory negligence, the compensation was              reduced by 50%, which worked out to Rs. 1.80 lacs. An              amount of Rs. 10,000 was awarded towards funeral              expenses.                  The compensation of Rs. 1,90,000 would carry              Interest @9% p.a. from the date of filing the claim, till              the date of payment.       4.4.   The MACT held all three respondents i.e. the driver of              the Maruti car, the owner of the car, and the Insurance              Company liable to pay the compensation awarded,              jointly and severally.   5.   Aggrieved by the aforesaid Judgment, the Claimants filed an       Appeal being F.A.O. No. 2294/2001 before the High Court for       further enhancement.                                          6 5.1.   The High Court vide the impugned Judgment and         Order dated 10.03.2014 upheld the findings of the         MACT regarding contributory negligence.  5.2.   With respect to the income of the deceased, the High         Court proceeded on the basis of the letter dated         27.06.1997 issued by the High Speed Group, , wherein         it was stated that Satpal Singh was working as a         General Manager, and drawing a salary of $ 6,700 p.m.         which would be equivalent to Rs. 2,68,000 p.m. at the         time when the claim was filed.  5.3.   The High Court assessed the compensation on the         basis of the income at Rs. 2,68,000 p.m. and adopted         the multiplier of 12.               The contribution to the family was fixed at 50% of         his    income,   which       would   approximately   be   Rs.         1,34,000 p.m.               Rs. 50,000 was awarded towards loss of estate,         and Rs. 10,000 towards funeral expenses.               On this basis, the total compensation payable to         the Claimants was computed at Rs. 96,78,000 after                                     7              making     a   partial   abatement   of   50%   towards               contributory negligence.                   The High Court held that since 50% of the income               was provided to the wife and children, it was not               necessary to provide for loss of consortium, and loss of               love and affection.       5.4.    The High Court held the Insurance Company to be               liable to pay the compensation, which would be               distributed equally between the widow and children of               the deceased. The enhanced amount of compensation               would carry Interest @7.5% p.a. from the date of filing               the claim, till realization.   6.   The Appellant – Insurance Company filed SLP (Civil) No.       28548/2014 to challenge the impugned Judgment.              The Claimants also filed an SLP bearing SLP (Civil) No.       12520/2015 claiming further enhancement of compensation.   7.   We have perused the pleadings and the documentary       evidence placed on record before the Courts below, and have       considered the oral submissions made by the Counsel for the       parties.                                         8              We are of the view that the judgments of both the MACT          and the High Court are liable to be set aside, and the          compensation is required to be awarded in accordance with          the law expounded by this Court in various decisions.  8.      Relevant principles for assessment of compensation in          cases of death as evolved by judicial dicta.               The criteria which are to be taken into consideration for          assessing compensation in the case of death, are : (i) the age          of the deceased at the time of his death; (ii) the number of          dependants left behind by the deceased; and (iii) the income          of the deceased at the time of his death.               In Sarla Verma & Ors. v. Delhi Transport Corporation &          Anr.,1 this Court held that to arrive at the loss of dependency,          the tribunal ought to take into consideration three factors :–           i) Additions/deductions to be made for arriving at the               income;           ii) The deduction to be made towards the personal living               expenses of the deceased; and           iii) The multiplier to be applied with reference to the age of               the deceased.    1   (2009) 6 SCC 121.                                       9        In order to provide uniformity and consistency in     awarding compensation, the following steps are required to be     followed :–         “Step 1 (Ascertaining the multiplicand)        The income of the deceased per annum should be determined.        Out of the said income a deduction should be made in regard to        the amount which the deceased would have spent on himself        by way of personal and living expenses. The balance, which is        considered to be the contribution to the dependant family,        constitutes the multiplicand.         Step 2 (Ascertaining the multiplier)        Having regard to the age of the deceased and period of active        career, the appropriate multiplier should be selected. This does        not mean ascertaining the number of years he would have lived        or worked but for the accident. Having regard to several        imponderables in life and economic factors, a table of        multipliers with reference to the age has been identified by this        Court. The multiplier should be chosen from the said table with        reference to the age of the deceased.         Step 3 (Actual calculation)        The annual contribution to the family (multiplicand) when        multiplied by such multiplier gives the 'loss of dependency' to        the family. Thereafter, a conventional amount in the range of        Rs. 5,000/- to Rs. 10,000/- may be added as loss of estate.        Where the deceased is survived by his widow, another        conventional amount in the range of 5,000/- to 10,000/- should        be added under the head of loss of consortium. But no amount        is to be awarded under the head of pain, suffering or hardship        caused to the legal heirs of the deceased.        The funeral expenses, cost of transportation of the body (if        incurred) and cost of any medical treatment of the deceased        before death (if incurred) should also added.”                                                    (emphasis supplied)  (a) Deduction for personal and living expenses         The personal and living expenses of the deceased should     be deducted from the income, to arrive at the contribution to     the family. In Sarla Verma (supra) (paras 30, 31 and 32), this                                      10 Court took the view that it was necessary to standardize the  deductions to be made under the head personal and living  expenses of the deceased.      Accordingly, it was held that :      ? where the deceased was married, the deduction         towards personal and living expenses should be 1/3rd         if the number of dependant family members is two to         three;      ? 1/4th if the number of dependant family members is         four to six; and      ? 1/5th if the number of dependant family members         exceeds six.      ? If the deceased was a bachelor, and the claim was         filed by the parents, the deduction would normally be         50% as personal and living expenses of the bachelor.             Subject to evidence to the contrary, the father was         likely to have his own income, and would not be         considered to be a dependant. Hence, the mother         alone will be considered to be a dependant.             In the absence of any evidence to the contrary,         brothers and sisters of the deceased bachelor would                               11                  not be considered to be dependants, because they                   would usually either be independent and earning, or                   married, or dependant on the father.                         Thus, even if the deceased was survived by                   parents and siblings, only the mother would be                   considered to be a dependant. The deduction towards                   personal expenses of a bachelor would be 50%, and                   50% would be the contribution to the family.                ? However, in a case where the family of the bachelor                   was large and dependant on the income of the                   deceased, as in a case where he had a widowed                   mother, and a large number of younger non-earning                   sisters or brothers, his personal and living expenses                   could be restricted to 1/3rd, and contribution to the                   family be taken as 2/3rd.                A three-judge bench in Reshma Kumari & Ors. v. Madan          Mohan & Anr.,2 affirmed the standards fixed in Sarla Verma          (supra) with respect to the deduction for personal and living          expenses, and held that these standards must ordinarily be     2   (2013) 9 SCC 65.                                       12        followed, unless a case for departure is made out. The Court         held :               “41. The above does provide guidance for the appropriate              deduction for personal and living expenses. One must bear in              mind that the proportion of a man’s net earnings that he saves              or spends exclusively for the maintenance of others does not              form part of his living expenses but what he spends exclusively              on himself does. The percentage of deduction on account of              personal and living expenses may vary with reference to the              number of dependant members in the family and the personal              living expenses of the deceased need not exactly correspond to              the number of dependants.               42. In our view, the standards fixed by this Court in Sarla              Verma 2009 (6) SCC 121 on the aspect of deduction for              personal living expenses in paragraphs 30, 31 and 32 must              ordinarily be followed unless a case for departure in the              circumstances noted in the preceding para is made out.”               43. In what we have discussed above, we sum up our              conclusions as follows:              …              43.6. Insofar as deduction for personal and living expenses is              concerned, it is directed that the Tribunals shall ordinarily              follow the standards prescribed in paragraphs 30, 31 and 32 of              the judgment in Sarla Verma 2009 (6) SCC 121 subject to the              observations made by us in para 38 above. …”                                                         (emphasis supplied)                 A Constitution Bench of this Court in National Insurance         Co. Ltd. v. Pranay Sethi & Ors.,3 held that the standards fixed         in    Sarla       Verma   (supra)    would   provide     guidance       for         appropriate deduction towards personal and living expenses,         and affirmed the conclusion in para 43.6 of Reshma Kumari         (supra).   3   (2017) 16 SCC 680.                                             13 (b) Determination of Multiplier               With respect to the multiplier, the Court in Sarla Verma         (supra), prepared a chart for fixing the applicable multiplier         in accordance with the age of the deceased, after considering         the     judgments     in   General     Manager,      Kerala    S.R.T.C.,         Trivandrum v. Susamma Thomas & Ors.,4 U.P.S.R.T.C. & Ors.         v. Trilok Chandra & Ors.,5 and New India Assurance Co. Ltd.         v. Charlie & Ors.6               The relevant extract from the said chart i.e. Column 4         has been set out hereinbelow for ready reference :–                Age of the deceased                Multiplier (Column 4)               Upto 15 years                      -               15 to 20 years                     18               21 to 25 years                     18               26 to 30 years                     17               31 to 35 years                     16               36 to 40 years                     15               41 to 45 years                     14               46 to 50 years                     13               51 to 55 years                     11               56 to 60 years                     9               61 to 65 years                     7               Above 65 years                     5         The Court in Sarla Verma (supra) held :–               “42. We therefore hold that the multiplier to be used should be              as mentioned in column (4) of the Table above (prepared by              applying Susamma Thomas, Trilok Chandra and Charlie), 4   (1994) 2 SCC 176. 5   (1996) 4 SCC 362. 6   (2005) 10 SCC 720.                                          14        which starts with an operative multiplier of 18 (for the age        groups of 15 to 20 and 21 to 25 years), reduced by one unit for        every five years, that is M-17 for 26 to 30 years, M-16 for 31 to        35 years, M-15 for 36 to 40 years, M-14 for 41 to 45 years, and        M-13 for 46 to 50 years, then reduced by two units for every        five years, that is, M-11 for 51 to 55 years, M-9 for 56 to 60        years, M-7 for 61 to 65 years and M-5 for 66 to 70 years.”                                                     (emphasis supplied)         In Reshma Kumari (supra), this Court affirmed Column 4     of the chart prepared in Sarla Verma (supra), and held that     this would provide uniformity and consistency in determining     the multiplier to be applied. The Constitution Bench in     Pranay Sethi (supra) affirmed the chart fixing the multiplier     as expounded in Sarla Verma (supra), and held :–         “44. At this stage, we must immediately say that insofar as the        aforesaid multiplicand/multiplier is concerned, it has to be        accepted on the basis of income established by the legal        representatives of the deceased. Future prospects are to be        added to the sum on the percentage basis and “income” means        actual income less than the tax paid. The multiplier has already        been fixed in Sarla Verma which has been approved in Reshma        Kumari with which we concur.        …        59.6. The selection of multiplier shall be as indicated in the        Table in Sarla Verma read with paragraph 42 of that        judgment.”                                                   (emphasis supplied)    (c) Age of the deceased must be the basis for determining     the multiplier even in case of a bachelor.         In Sarla Verma (supra), this Court held that the     multiplier should be determined with reference to the age of                                        15      the deceased. This was subsequently affirmed in Reshma       Kumari (supra), and followed in a line of decisions.             A three-judge bench in Munna Lal Jain & Ors. v. Vipin       Kumar Sharma & Ors.,7 held that the issue had been decided       in Reshma Kumari (supra), wherein this Court held that the       multiplier must be with reference to the age of the deceased.       The decision in Munna Lal Jain (supra) was followed by       another three-judge bench of this Court in Sube Singh & Ors.       v. Shyam Singh (dead) & Ors.8             The Constitution Bench in National Insurance Company       Limited v. Pranay Sethi & Ors.,9 affirmed the view taken in       Sarla Verma (supra) and Reshma Kumari (supra), and held       that the age of the deceased should be the basis for applying       the multiplier.             Another three-judge bench in Royal Sundaram Alliance       Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Mandala Yadagari Goud & Ors.,10 traced       out the law on this issue, and held that the compensation is       to be computed based on what the deceased would have       contributed to support the dependants. In the case of the       death of a married person, it is an accepted norm that the 7 (2015) 6 SCC 347. 8 (2018) 3 SCC 18. 9 (2017) 16 SCC 680. 10 (2019) 5 SCC 554.                                    16         age of the deceased would be taken into account. Thus, even          in the case of a bachelor, the same principle must be applied.               The aforesaid legal position has recently been re-affirmed          by this Court in Sunita Tokas and Ors. v. New India          Insurance Co. Ltd. and Ors.11   (d) Future Prospects               In the wake of increased inflation, rising consumer          prices, and general standards of living, future prospects have          to be taken into consideration, not only with respect to the          status or educational qualifications of the deceased, but also          other relevant factors such as higher salaries and perks          which are being offered by private companies these days. The          dearness allowance and perks from which the family would          have derived monthly benefit, are required to be taken into          consideration for determining the loss of dependency.               In Sarla Verma (supra), this Court held :               “24. In Susamma Thomas, this Court increased the income by              nearly 100%, in Sarla Dixit, the income was increased only by              50% and in Abati Bezbaruah the income was increased by a              mere 7%. In view of imponderables and uncertainties, we are in              favour of adopting as a rule of thumb, an addition of 50% of              actual salary to the actual salary income of the deceased              towards future prospects, where the deceased had a              permanent job and was below 40 years. [Where the annual              income is in the taxable range, the words ‘actual salary’ should  11   2019 (11) SCALE 24.                                           17     be read as ‘actual salary less tax’]. The addition should be only     30% if the age of the deceased was 40 to 50 years. There     should be no addition, where the age of deceased is more than     50 years. Though the evidence may indicate a different     percentage of increase, it is necessary to standardize the     addition to avoid different yardsticks being applied or different     methods of calculations being adopted. Where the deceased     was self-employed or was on a fixed salary (without provision     for annual increments etc.), the courts will usually take only the     actual income at the time of death. A departure therefrom     should be made only in rare and exceptional cases involving     special circumstances.”                                                   (emphasis supplied)       In   Pranay      Sethi    (supra),    the    Constitution      Bench  evaluated all the judicial precedents on the issue of future  prospects including Sarla Verma (supra), and devised a fixed  standard for granting future prospects. It was held :      “57. Having bestowed our anxious consideration, we are     disposed to think when we accept the principle of     standardization, there is really no rationale not to apply the     said principle to the self-employed or a person who is on a fixed     salary. To follow the doctrine of actual income at the time of     death and not to add any amount with regard to future     prospects to the income for the purpose of determination of     multiplicand would be unjust. The determination of income     while computing compensation has to include future prospects     so that the method will come within the ambit and sweep of just     compensation as postulated Under Section 168 of the Act. In     case of a deceased who had held a permanent job with inbuilt     grant of annual increment, there is an acceptable certainty. But     to state that the legal representatives of a deceased who was     on a fixed salary would not be entitled to the benefit of future     prospects for the purpose of computation of compensation     would be inapposite. It is because the criterion of distinction     between the two in that event would be certainty on the one     hand and staticness on the other. One may perceive that the     comparative measure is certainty on the one hand and     uncertainty on the other but such a perception is fallacious. It is     because the price rise does affect a self-employed person; and     that apart there is always an incessant effort to enhance one's     income for sustenance. The purchasing capacity of a salaried     person on permanent job when increases because of grant of                                   18 increments and pay revision or for some other change in service conditions, there is always a competing attitude in the private sector to enhance the salary to get better efficiency from the employees. Similarly, a person who is self-employed is bound to garner his resources and raise his charges/fees so that he can live with same facilities. To have the perception that he is likely to remain static and his income to remain stagnant is contrary to the fundamental concept of human attitude which always intends to live with dynamism and move and change with the time. Though it may seem appropriate that there cannot be certainty in addition of future prospects to the existing income unlike in the case of a person having a permanent job, yet the said perception does not really deserve acceptance. We are inclined to think that there can be some degree of difference as regards the percentage that is meant for or applied to in respect of the legal representatives who claim on behalf of the deceased who had a permanent job than a person who is self-employed or on a fixed salary. But not to apply the principle of standardization on the foundation of perceived lack of certainty would tantamount to remaining oblivious to the marrows of ground reality. And, therefore, degree-test is imperative. Unless the degree-test is applied and left to the parties to adduce evidence to establish, it would be unfair and inequitable. The degree-test has to have the inbuilt concept of percentage. Taking into consideration the cumulative factors, namely, passage of time, the changing society, escalation of price, the change in price index, the human attitude to follow a particular pattern of life, etc., an addition of 40% of the established income of the deceased towards future prospects and where the deceased was below 40 years an addition of 25% where the deceased was between the age of 40 to 50 years would be reasonable.  59. The controversy does not end here. The question still remains whether there should be no addition where the age of the deceased is more than 50 years. Sarla Verma thinks it appropriate not to add any amount and the same has been approved in Reshma Kumari. Judicial notice can be taken of the fact that salary does not remain the same. When a person is in a permanent job, there is always an enhancement due to one reason or the other. To lay down as a thumb Rule that there will be no addition after 50 years will be an unacceptable concept. We are disposed to think, there should be an addition of 15% if the deceased is between the age of 50 to 60 years and there should be no addition thereafter. Similarly, in case of self- employed or person on fixed salary, the addition should be 10% between the age of 50 to 60 years. The aforesaid yardstick has been fixed so that there can be consistency in the approach by the tribunals and the courts.                                19           59. In view of the aforesaid analysis, we proceed to record our           conclusions:           …           59.3. While determining the income, an addition of 50%           of actual salary to the income of the deceased towards           future prospects, where the deceased had a permanent           job and was below the age of 40 years, should be made.           The addition should be 30%, if the age of the deceased           was between 40 to 50 years. In case the deceased was           between the age of 50 to 60 years, the addition should be           15%. Actual salary should be read as actual salary less           tax.           59.4. In case the deceased was self-employed or on a           fixed salary, an addition of 40% of the established           income should be the warrant where the deceased was           below the age of 40 years. An addition of 25% where the           deceased was between the age of 40 to 50 years and 10%           where the deceased was between the age of 50 to 60           years should be regarded as the necessary method of           computation. The established income means the income           minus the tax component. …”                                                      (emphasis supplied)   (e) Three Conventional Heads            In Pranay Sethi (supra), the Constitution Bench held that     in death cases, compensation would be awarded only under     three     conventional     heads       viz.   loss    of    estate,     loss   of     consortium and funeral expenses.            The Court held that the conventional and traditional     heads, cannot be determined on percentage basis, because     that     would     not    be    an     acceptable          criterion.

These Appeals and Special Leave Petitions arise by virtue of a Signature Not Verified               reference order of a Division Bench of this Court reported as Tofan Digitally signed by R Natarajan Date: 2020.10.29 18:54:11 IST Reason:                Singh v. State of Tamil Nadu (2013) 16 SCC 31. The facts in that                                                                                  1   appeal have been set out in that judgment in some detail, and need not    be repeated by us. After hearing arguments from both sides, the Court    recorded that the Appellant in Criminal Appeal No.152 of 2013 had    challenged his conviction primarily on three grounds, as follows:         “24.1. The conviction is based solely on the purported        confessional statement recorded under Section 67 of the        NDPS Act which has no evidentiary value inasmuch as:        (a) The statement was given to and recorded by an officer        who is to be treated as “police officer” and is thus, hit by        Section 25 of the Evidence Act.        (b) No such confessional statement could be recorded        under Section 67 of the NDPS Act. This provision        empowers to call for information and not to record such        confessional statements. Thus, the statement recorded        under this provision is akin to the statement under Section        161 CrPC.        (c) In any case, the said statement having been retracted,        it could not have been the basis of conviction and could        be used only to corroborate other evidence.” 2. Under the caption “Evidentiary value of statement under section 67 of    the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, Act, 1985 (“NDPS    Act”)”, the Court noted the decisions of Raj Kumar Karwal v. Union of    India (1990) 2 SCC 409 and Kanhaiyalal v. Union of India (2008) 4    SCC 668, as also certain other judgments, most notably Abdul Rashid    v. State of Bihar (2001) 9 SCC 578 and Noor Aga v. State of Punjab    (2008) 16 SCC 417, and thereafter came to the conclusion that the    NDPS Act, being a penal statute, is in contradistinction to the Customs    Act, 1962 and the Central Excise Act, 1944, whose dominant object is                                                                          2 to protect the revenue of the State, and that therefore, judgments  rendered in the context of those Acts may not be apposite when  considering the NDPS Act – see paragraph 33. After then considering a  number of other judgments, the referral order states that a re-look into  the ratio of Raj Kumar Karwal (supra) and Kanhaiyalal (supra) would  be necessary, and has referred the matter to a larger Bench thus:       “41. For the aforesaid reasons, we are of the view that the      matter needs to be referred to a larger Bench for      reconsideration of the issue as to whether the officer      investigating the matter under the NDPS Act would qualify      as police officer or not.      42. In this context, the other related issue viz. whether the      statement recorded by the investigating officer under      Section 67 of the Act can be treated as confessional      statement or not, even if the officer is not treated as police      officer also needs to be referred to the larger Bench,      inasmuch as it is intermixed with a facet of the 1st issue      as to whether such a statement is to be treated as      statement under Section 161 of the Code or it partakes      the character of statement under Section 164 of the Code.      43. As far as this second related issue is concerned we      would also like to point out that Mr Jain argued that the      provisions of Section 67 of the Act cannot be interpreted      in the manner in which the provisions of Section 108 of      the Customs Act or Section 14 of the Excise Act had been      interpreted by a number of judgments and there is a      qualitative difference between the two sets of provisions.      Insofar as Section 108 of the Customs Act is concerned, it      gives power to the custom officer to summon persons “to      give evidence” and produce documents. Identical power is      conferred upon the Central Excise Officer under Section      14 of the Act. However, the wording to Section 67 of the      NDPS Act is altogether different. This difference has been      pointed out by the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Shahid      Khan v. Director of Revenue Intelligence [2001 Cri LJ      3183 (AP)].”                                                                        3 3. Shri Sushil Kumar Jain, learned Senior Advocate appearing for the    Appellants in Criminal Appeal Nos. 152 of 2013; 836 of 2011; 433 of    2014; 77 of 2015 and 1202 of 2017, outlined six issues before us, which    really boil down to two issues, namely:         “1. Whether an officer “empowered under Section 42 of        the NDPS Act” and/or “the officer empowered under        Section 53 of the NDPS Act” are “Police Officers” and        therefore statements recorded by such officers would be        hit by Section 25 of the Evidence Act; and        2. What is the extent, nature, purpose and scope of the        power conferred under Section 67 of the NDPS Act        available to and exercisable by an officer under section 42        thereof, and whether power under Section 67 is a power        to record confession capable of being used as substantive        evidence to convict an accused?” 4. Shri Jain took us through the provisions of the NDPS Act which,    according to him, is a special Act, and a complete code on the subject it    covers. He referred to how the NDPS Act sometimes overrides the    Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (“CrPC”); sometimes says that it is    applicable; and sometimes states that it is made applicable with    necessary modifications. According to Shri Jain, section 41(2) and    section 42 of the NDPS Act refer to a ‘First Information Report’ being    lodged by the officers referred to therein. As the source of information is    required to be kept a secret under section 68 of the NDPS Act, the    officer receiving information under these provisions is therefore treated    as an informant. The tasks assigned to officers under section 42 of the    NDPS Act are four in number, namely, entry, search, seizure or arrest.                                                                             4 As opposed to this, section 53 of the NDPS Act invests the designated  officers with all the powers of an ‘officer-in-charge of a police station’ for  the process of investigation, which would then begin after information  collected by a section 42 officer is handed over to the officer designated  under section 53, and end with a final report being submitted under  section 173 of the CrPC to the Special Court under section 36A(1)(d) of  the NDPS Act. According to the learned Senior Advocate, section 67 is  to be read only with section 42, and is a power to call for information so  that the “reason to believe” mentioned in section 42 can then be made  out, without proceeding further under the NDPS Act. Thus, “reason to  believe”, which is at a higher threshold than “reason to suspect” – which  phrase has been used in section 49 of the NDPS Act – is a condition  precedent to the officer thereafter moving forward. Shri Jain argued that  the reason to believe must be formed before the officer acts, and that  therefore, section 67 operates at a stage antecedent to the exercise of  the powers of the officer designated under section 42. He then went on  to argue that these provisions must be construed strictly in favour of the  subject, inasmuch as they impinge upon the fundamental right to  privacy, recently recognised by this Court in K.S. Puttaswamy and Anr.  v. Union of India and Ors. (2017) 10 SCC 1. He also argued that the  NDPS Act therefore incorporates a legislative balance between powers  of investigation and the obligation to uphold privacy rights of the                                                                              5 individual. He then went on to argue that the “information” under section  67 of the NDPS Act cannot be equated with “evidence”, which is only  evidence before a court, as per the definition of “evidence” under the  Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (“Evidence Act”). He cited judgments to  show that even witness statements made under section 164 of the  CrPC are not substantive evidence. He then contrasted section 67 of  the NDPS Act with the power of officers under revenue acts to record  evidence, such as section 108 of the Customs Act 1962, and section 14  of the Central Excise Act 1944. He then went on to state that as none of  the safeguards contained in sections 161-164 of the CrPC are  contained in the NDPS Act when the person is examined under section  67, obviously statements made to officers under section 67 cannot  amount to substantive evidence on the basis of which conviction can  then take place. An important argument was that it would be highly  incongruous if an officer of the police department, empowered under  section 42 and exercising the same powers under section 67, records a  confessional statement which would be hit by section 25 of the  Evidence Act, whereas officers exercising the same powers under the  NDPS Act, who are not regular policemen, would be able to record  confessional statements, and bypass all constitutional and statutory  safeguards. Shri Jain contended that as the provisions of the NDPS Act  are extremely stringent, they must be strictly construed, and safeguards                                                                         6 provided must be scrupulously followed. According to him, arbitrary  power conferred under section 67 upon an officer above the rank of  peon, sepoy or constable, but denied to a senior officer under section  53, would be ex facie contrary to Article 14 of the Constitution. On the  other hand, section 53 statutorily confers powers on the named officer  of an officer-in-charge of a police station for the investigation of the  offences under the NDPS Act. This, according to the learned counsel,  would contain the entire gamut of powers contained in sections 160-173  of the CrPC, including the power to then file a charge-sheet before the  Special Court under section 36A(1)(d) of the NDPS Act. The learned  counsel argued that section 53A of the NDPS Act shows that  confessional statements that are made under section 161 of the CrPC,  which are otherwise hit by section 162 of the CrPC, are made relevant  only in the two contingencies mentioned under section 53A of the NDPS  Act, being exceptions to the general rule stated in section 162 of the  CrPC. He contended, therefore, that section 67 of the NDPS Act cannot  be used to bypass section 53A therein and render it otiose. He stressed  the fact that all offences under the NDPS Act are cognizable offences,  unlike under revenue statutes like the Customs Act, 1962 and Central  Excise Act, 1944, and then argued that the “complaint” that is referred  to in section 36A(1)(d) of the NDPS Act has only reference to a  complaint filed under section 59(3) therein. He also pointed out the                                                                        7 anomalies of granting to the concerned officer under section 53 all the  powers of the officer-in-charge of a police station, which, unless it ends  up in the form of a final report, would leave things hanging. Thus, if the  concerned officer finds that there is no sufficient evidence, and that the  accused should be released, section 169 of the CrPC would apply. In  the absence of section 169 of the CrPC, as has been contended by the  other side, there is no procedure for discharge of the accused if  evidence against him is found to be wanting. In a without-prejudice  argument that complaints under the NDPS Act can be made outside of  section 59(3), Shri Jain stressed the fact that there is in reality and  substance no difference between the “complaint” under the NDPS Act  and the charge-sheet under the CrPC, as investigation has already  been carried out even before the complaint under the NDPS Act is  made. He therefore argued that both Raj Kumar Karwal (supra) and  Kanhaiyalal (supra) require to be overruled by us, as they erroneously  applied earlier judgments which concerned themselves with revenue  statutes, and not penal statutes like the NDPS Act. He then referred us  to Article 20(3) of the Constitution, and section 25 of the Evidence Act,  and cited a plethora of case law to drive home the point that in this  country, as coercive methods are used against persons during the  course of investigation, all confessions made to a police officer, whether  made during the course of investigation or even before, cannot be relied                                                                          8   upon as evidence in a trial. He then referred to several judgments of    this Court to state that the expression “police officer” is not defined, and    the functional test therefore must apply, namely, that a person who is    given the same functions as a police officer under the CrPC, particularly    in the course of investigating an offence under the Act, must be    regarded as a police officer for the purpose of section 25 of the    Evidence Act. In the course of his submissions, he referred to a number    of judgments of this Court, and most particularly, the judgments of State    of Punjab v. Barkat Ram (1962) 3 SCR 338; Raja Ram Jaiswal v.    State of Bihar (1964) 2 SCR 752; Badku Joti Savant v. State of    Mysore (1966) 3 SCR 698; Romesh Chandra Mehta v. State of West    Bengal (1969) 2 SCR 461; Illias v. Collector of Customs, Madras    (1969) 2 SCR 613; and Balkishan A. Devidayal v. State of    Maharashtra (1980) 4 SCC 600. He also provided a useful chart of the    difference in the provisions contained in the NDPS Act and the Railway    Property (Unlawful Possession) Act, 1966, the Sea Customs Act, 1878,    the Central Excise Act, 1944, and the Customs Act, 1962.  5. Shri Puneet Jain supplemented these arguments with reference to a    recent judgment of a Constitution Bench of this Court in Mukesh Singh    v. State (Narcotic Branch of Delhi) 2020 SCC OnLine SC 700, and    stated that as some discordant notes are to be found in that judgment, it    may be referred to a larger Bench. In any case, he argued that the                                                                              9  comments made in that judgment about investigation starting from the   section 42 stage itself were only in the context of the complainant and   the investigator being the same, in which case, if prejudice was caused,   the trial may be vitiated in terms of the judgment.  6. Shri Anand Grover, learned Senior Advocate, appearing for the   Appellant in Criminal Appeal No. 90 of 2017, followed in the wake of the   two Jains, père et fils. The learned Senior Advocate stressed the   various provisions of the NDPS Act which showed that it was extremely   stringent, in that it had minimum sentences for even possession of what   is regarded as a “commercial quantity” of a drug or psychotropic   substance, being a minimum sentence of rigorous imprisonment of 10   years, going up to 20 years. This, coupled with various presumptions   raised against the accused, and stringent bail conditions, all made the   NDPS Act a very stringent measure of legislation, which, the more   stringent it is, must contain necessary safeguards against arbitrary   search, seizure and arrest, or else it would fall foul of the fundamental   rights chapter of the Constitution. He argued that the NDPS Act was   penal in nature, and contained regulatory provisions as well, but given   the fact that we are concerned only with the penal provisions, could be   distinguished from the revenue statutes whose dominant object is the   collection of revenue, and not the punishment of crime. He stressed the   fact that the “enquiry” under section 67 of the NDPS Act is not a judicial                                                                          10 enquiry, but only a preliminary fact-finding exercise before a “reason to  believe” is formed under section 42, which could then lead to  investigation of an offence under the Act. He also referred to section 50  of the NDPS Act, and stated that given a higher protection as to  conditions under which a search of person may be conducted, it would  be inconceivable to then conclude that under section 67, confessional  statements can be recorded without more, subject to no safeguards  whatsoever, on which convictions can then be based. He relied strongly  on State of Punjab v. Baldev Singh (1999) 6 SCC 172 and its  aftermath Vijaysinh Chandubha Jadeja v. State of Gujarat (2011) 1  SCC 609 to argue that even after sub-sections (5) and (6) were added  to section 50 of the NDPS Act, they did not dilute what was contained in  section 50(1)-(4), and could only be used in emergent and urgent  situations. He referred to statutes like the Terrorist and Disruptive  Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987 (“TADA”), and stated that where under  certain limited circumstances exceptions were made to section 25 of the  Evidence Act, they were hedged in with a number of safeguards, as  were laid down by this Court in Kartar Singh v. State of Punjab (1994)  3 SCC 569. According to him, therefore, “police officer” needs to be  construed functionally to include special police officers under the NDPS  Act, in the context of confessions made, with reference to section 25 of                                                                          11   the Evidence Act. He joined Shri Jain in asking for an overruling of Raj     Kumar Karwal (supra) and Kanhaiyalal (supra). 7. Shri S. Nagamuthu, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the    Appellant in Criminal Appeal No. 1826 of 2013, referred to sections 41    to 43 of the NDPS Act, and emphasised the fact that no powers to    “investigate” any offences are vested in the officers mentioned in these    sections. He then referred to section 36 of the CrPC, and said that the    scheme followed in the NDPS Act could be assimilated to section 36, in    that, police officers superior in rank to an officer in charge of a police    station may exercise the same powers, throughout the local area to    which they are appointed, as may be exercised by such officer within    the limits of his station. He emphasised the fact that section 25 of the    Evidence Act only applies to confessions made against the maker, as    against statements recorded under section 161 of the CrPC, which are    completely barred from being received in evidence under section 162 of    the CrPC, save and except for purposes of contradiction. He argued    that a confessional statement made to a section 41 or section 42 officer    was also hit by section 25 of the Evidence Act. He added that the    special procedure in section 36A of the NDPS Act applies only qua    offences punishable for a term of more than three years, and where    offences under the Act are punishable for terms up to three years, they    are to be tried by a Magistrate under the CrPC. Obviously, officers                                                                            12  under section 53 of the NDPS Act would investigate an offence under   the Act that is punishable for a term up to three years, and file a police   report, as no complaint procedure, being the procedure under section   36A of the NDPS Act, would then apply. According to him, this would   show that investigation does culminate in a police report for offences   punishable for a term up to three years, as a result of which section   36A(1)(d) has to be read as providing two methods of approaching a   Special Court – one, by way of a police report, and the other, by way of     a complaint to the Special Court. 8. Shri Uday Gupta, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the   Appellant in Criminal Appeal No. 344 of 2013, supplemented the   arguments of his predecessors, and stressed the fact that the “enquiry”   under section 67 of the NDPS Act cannot possibly be governed by the   definition of “inquiry” under section 2(g) of the CrPC, as that “inquiry”   relates only to inquiries conducted by a Magistrate or Court. Hence, the   expression “enquiry” under section 67 must be given its ordinary   meaning, which would indicate that it is only a preliminary fact-finding   enquiry that is referred to. He relied strongly on the Directorate of Law   Enforcement Handbook, in which the Directorate made it clear that   when statements are recorded under section 67 of the NDPS Act by the   police, these would amount to statements under section 161 of the   CrPC. He contended that if this is so, it would be extremely anomalous                                                                           13    to have statements recorded under section 67 by officers other than the     police – mentioned under sections 41 and 42 of the NDPS Act, which     are not statements made under section 161 of the CrPC – being     admissible in evidence, on which a conviction of an accused can then      be based.  9. Shri Gupta was followed by Shri Sanjay Jain, learned Advocate     appearing on behalf of the Appellant in Criminal Appeal No. 1750 of     2009, who supplemented the arguments of his predecessors by     referring to section 53A, and notifications made under section 53, of the     NDPS Act. He reiterated that officers under section 42 and officers     under section 53 of the NDPS Act perform different functions, and that a     section 53 officer, being empowered to “investigate”, most certainly has      the power to file a police report before the Special Court. 10. Shri Aman Lekhi, learned Additional Solicitor General, appearing on     behalf of the Union of India, took us through the NDPS Act, and said,     that read as a whole, it is a balanced statute which protected both the     investigation of crime, as well as the citizen, in that several safeguards     were contained therein. He was at pains to point out that it was not his     case that a confession recorded under section 67 of the NDPS Act,     without more, would be sufficient to convict a person accused of an     offence under the Act. According to him, this could only be done if     section 24 of the Evidence Act was met, and the Court was satisfied     that the confession so recorded was both voluntary and truthful. In any                                                                            14 case, he asserted that the safeguards that have been pointed out in  D.K. Basu v. Union of India (1997) 1 SCC 416 at 435, 436, have now  largely been incorporated in Chapter V of the CrPC, which safeguards  would also operate qua confessions recorded under section 67 of the  NDPS Act. According to him, section 67 on its plain language does not  refer to the “information” spoken of in section 42, as it uses the  expression “require” any person to produce or deliver a document, as  opposed to information “called for” from such persons. He also argued,  based on judgments of this Court, that confessions, if properly  recorded, are the best form of evidence, as these are facts known to the  accused, about which he then voluntarily deposes. He also argued that  section 190 of the CrPC is not completely displaced by section 36A(1)  (d) of the NDPS Act, in that the requirement of the filing of a complaint  and/or a police report contained in section 190 continues to apply, in  support of the decision in Raj Kumar Karwal (supra). He then referred  in detail to Badku Joti Savant (supra), and stated that this judgment  was not considered in the reference order, and that finally, the only test  that is laid down by several Constitution Bench judgments to determine  whether a person is or is not a “police officer” is whether such person is  given the right to file a report under section 173 of the CrPC. He made it  clear that section 53 of the NDPS Act did not deem the officers named  therein to be police officers – they were only given certain powers of                                                                         15 investigation, which did not ultimately lead to filing of a charge-sheet  under section 173 of the CrPC. What was clear was that only a  “complaint” could be filed by such officers under section 36A(1)(d) of the  NDPS Act – the police report being only filed by the police force as  constituted under the Police Act, 1861. He disagreed vehemently with  the submission of Shri Jain that the “complaint” under section 36A(1)(d)  would refer only to the complaint under section 59(3) of the NDPS Act,  and referred to section 2(xxix) of the NDPS Act to refer to the definition  of “complaint” under section 2(d) of the CrPC, which is used in the  same sense as in the CrPC. He then pointed out several provisions in  the NDPS Act, where the word “police” or “police officer” is used in  contrast to the other persons or officers who are part of the narcotics  and other setups. According to him, in any case, section 53A makes an  inroad into section 25 of the Evidence Act. Equally, according to him,  the majority judgment in Raja Ram Jaiswal (supra) is per incuriam,  inasmuch as it does not consider several provisions of the CrPC, and  therefore, arrives at the wrong test to determine as to who can be said  to be a “police officer” within the meaning of section 25 of the Evidence  Act. In any case, he argued that the officers mentioned in sections 41  and 42 of the NDPS Act cannot be tarnished with the same brush as the  regular police, as there is nothing to show that these officers use third-  degree measures to extort confessions. He then referred to the                                                                         16    language of section 67 of the NDPS Act, in which, according to him, the     expression “enquiry” is nothing but an investigation, and the expression     “examine” is the same expression used in section 161 of the CrPC,     which therefore should be accorded evidentiary value, as no safeguards     as provided under section 162 of the CrPC are mentioned qua     statements made under section 67 of the NDPS Act. He also argued     that investigation begins from the stage of collection of material under     section 67, and for this relied strongly upon the recent Constitution     Bench judgment in Mukesh Singh (supra). According to him, therefore,     the reference order itself being flawed, there ought to have been no     reference at all, and that the judgments in Raj Kumar Karwal (supra)     and Kanhaiyalal (supra) do not need reconsideration. Later judgments     such as Noor Aga (supra) ought to be overruled by us, inasmuch as      they are contrary to several Constitution Bench judgments of this Court. 11. Shri Saurabh Mishra, learned Additional Advocate General appearing     on behalf of the State of Madhya Pradesh in SLP (Crl.) 1202 of 2017,     largely reiterated the submissions of learned ASG, adding that when     section 67 of the NDPS Act is used to record the confession of an     accused, section 164 of the CrPC will not apply, but only section 24 of     the Evidence Act makes such confessions relevant, if the conditions laid     down in the section apply. He also reiterated that a statement recorded     under section 67 of the NDPS Act cannot be assimilated to a statement                                                                            17    under section 161 of the CrPC, for the reasons outlined by the learned      ASG. 12. Shri Aniruddha Mayee, learned counsel appearing for the State of     Gujarat in Criminal Appeal No. 2214 of 2009; 344 of 2013; and 1750 of     2009, adopted the submissions of Shri Aman Lekhi, learned ASG.  13. Having heard wide-ranging arguments of counsel on both sides, it is     first necessary to give a Constitutional backdrop to the points that arise     in this case.    FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND THE NDPS ACT  14. The first most important constitutional protection provided in the     fundamental rights chapter so far as these cases are concerned is     provided by Article 20(3), which is the well-known right against self-     incrimination. Article 20(3) reads as follows:           “(3) No person accused of any offence shall be compelled          to be a witness against himself.” 15. In an early judgment of this Court, M.P. Sharma and Ors. v. Satish     Chandra 1954 SCR 1077, an eight-Judge Bench of this Court set out     Article 20(3), and then went into the historical origin of this Article in     English law. In an important passage, the Court held:           “In view of the above background, there is no inherent          reason to construe the ambit of this fundamental right as          comprising a very wide range. Nor would it be legitimate          to confine it to the barely literal meaning of the words          used, since it is a recognised doctrine that when          appropriate a constitutional provision has to be liberally          construed, so as to advance the intendment thereof and                                                                            18 to prevent its circumvention. Analysing the terms in which this right has been declared in our Constitution, it may be said to consist of the following components. (1) It is a right pertaining to a person “accused of an offence”; (2) It is a protection against “compulsion to be a witness”; and (3) It is a protection against such compulsion resulting in his giving evidence “against himself”.”                                             (at page 1086) xxx xxx xxx Broadly stated the guarantee in Article 20(3) is against “testimonial compulsion”. It is suggested that this is confined to the oral evidence of a person standing his trial for an offence when called to the witness-stand. We can see no reason to confine the content of the constitutional guarantee to this barely literal import. So to limit it would be to rob the guarantee of its substantial purpose and to miss the substance for the sound as stated in certain American decisions. The phrase used in Article 20(3) is “to be a witness”. A person can “be a witness” not merely by giving oral evidence but also by producing documents or making intelligible gestures as in the case of a dumb witness (See Section 119 of the Evidence Act) or the like. “To be a witness” is nothing more than “to furnish evidence” and such evidence can be furnished through the lips or by production of a thing or of a document or in other modes. So far as production of"

The Family Court vide a detailed Order dated 24.08.2015         awarded interim maintenance of Rs.15,000 per month to the Respondent No.1-         wife from 01.09.2013; and Rs.5,000 per month as interim maintenance for the         Respondent No.2-son from 01.09.2013 to 31.08.2015; and @ Rs. 10,000 per         month from 01.09.2015 onwards till further orders were passed in the main         petition. (ii)           The Appellant-husband challenged the Order of the Family Court vide         Criminal Writ Petition No.875/2015 filed before the Bombay High Court,         Nagpur Bench. The High Court dismissed the Writ Petition vide Order dated         14.08.2018, and affirmed the Judgment passed by the Family Court. (iii)          The present appeal has been filed to impugn the Order dated 14.08.2018.         This Court issued notice to the wife and directed the Appellant-husband to file         his Income Tax Returns and Assessment Orders for the period from 2005-2006         till date. He was also directed to place a photocopy of his passport on record. By         a further Order dated 11.09.2019, the Appellant-husband was directed to make         payment of the arrears of Rs.2,00,000 towards interim maintenance to the wife;         and a further amount of Rs.3,00,000, which was due and payable to the wife         towards arrears of maintenance, as per his own admission. By a subsequent         Order dated 14.10.2019, it was recorded that only a part of the arrears had been         paid. A final opportunity was granted to the Appellant-husband to make payment         of the balance amount by 30.11.2019, failing which, the Court would proceed         under the Contempt of Courts Act for wilful disobedience with the Orders passed         by this Court.                                                  2                In the backdrop of the facts of this case, we considered it fit to frame        guidelines on certain aspects pertaining to the payment of maintenance in        matrimonial matters. There are different statutes providing for making an        application for grant of maintenance / interim maintenance, if any person having        sufficient means neglects, or refuses to maintain his wife, children, parents. The        different enactments provide an independent and distinct remedy framed with a        specific object and purpose. Inspite of time frames being prescribed by various        statutes for disposal of interim applications, we have noticed, in practice that in        a vast majority of cases, the applications are not disposed of within the time        frame prescribed. To address various issues which arise for consideration in        applications for grant of maintenance / interim maintenance, it is necessary to        frame guidelines to ensure that there is uniformity and consistency in deciding        the same. To seek assistance on these issues, we have appointed Ms. Anitha        Shenoy and Mr. Gopal Sankaranaryanan, Senior Advocates as Amici Curiae,        who have graciously accepted to assist this Court. (iv)           By a further Order dated 17.12.2019, the Appellant was directed to pay        an amount of Rs.1,45,000 to the Respondent no.1-wife within a period of 45        days.                On the issue of framing guidelines, the National Legal Services Authority        was directed to elicit responses from the State Legal Services Authorities of        various States. (v)            By a subsequent Order dated 05.08.2020, it was recorded that an Affidavit        of Compliance had been filed on 04.08.2020 by the Appellant-husband, wherein        it was stated that arrears of Rs.1,45,000 till 11.09.2019 had been paid by him in        January, 2020. However, he had made no further payment to the wife thereafter.        With respect to the amount of Rs.10,000 p.m. payable for the minor son, the        Order had been complied with till July 2020. A statement was made by the        Counsel for the Appellant that he was not disputing the payment of maintenance        for his son, and would continue to pay the same. A direction was issued by this        Court to pay the entire arrears of maintenance to the wife @ Rs.15,000 p.m. as                                                   3          fixed by the Family Court, and continue to pay the said amount during the          pendency of proceedings. (vi)            By the Order dated 25.08.2020, it was noted that the Appellant had filed          an Affidavit dated 23.08.2020 wherein he had admitted and acknowledged that          an amount of Rs.5,00,000 was pending towards arrears of maintenance to the          Respondent No.1-wife. The Appellant was directed to pay 50% of the arrears          within a period of 4 weeks to the Respondent No.1, failing which, he was          directed to remain present before the Court on the next date of hearing. The          Counsel for the husband placed on record a chart of various proceedings pending          between the parties. Taking note of the aforesaid facts, we considered it          appropriate to refer the matter for mediation by Mr. Shridhar Purohit, Advocate,          a well-known Mediator in Nagpur, to resolve all disputes pending between the          parties, and arrive at an overall settlement. (vii)           On 08.10.2020, we were informed that the mediation had failed. The          husband appeared before the Court, and made an oral statement that he did not          have the financial means to comply with the Order of maintenance payable to          the Respondent No.1-wife, and had to borrow loans from his father to pay the          same. He however stated that he had paid the maintenance awarded to the son,          and would continue to do so without demur. Both parties addressed arguments          and filed their written submissions. (viii)          We have heard the Counsel for the parties, and perused the written          submissions filed on their behalf.                 The husband has inter alia submitted that he was presently unemployed,          and was not in a position to pay maintenance to the Respondent No.1-wife. He          stated that he did not own any immovable property, and had only one operational          bank account. The husband declined to pay any further amount towards the          maintenance of his wife. It was further submitted that the Family Court had          erroneously relied upon the Income Tax Returns of 2006, while determining the          maintenance payable in 2013. He further submitted that he was exploring new          business projects, which would enable him to be in a better position to sustain          his family.                                                    4                 The wife has inter alia submitted that the amount of Rs.10,000 awarded        for the son was granted when he was 2 ½ years old in 2015. The said amount        was now highly inadequate to meet the expenses of a growing child, who is 7 ½        years old, and is a school-going boy. It was further submitted that the admission        fee for the current academic year 2020-2021 had not yet been paid. If the fee        was not paid within time, the school would discontinue sending the link for        online classes. She submitted that she was being over-burdened by the growing        expenses, with no support from the husband.                 With respect to the contention of the husband that he had no income, she        submitted that the husband had made investments in real estate projects, and        other businesses, which he was concealing from the Court, and diverting the        income to his parents. It has also been alleged that the Appellant had retained        illegal possession of her Streedhan, which he was refusing to return. Despite        orders being passed by this Court, and in the proceedings under the D.V. Act, he        was deliberately not complying with the same. In these circumstances, it was        submitted that there was a major trust deficit, and there was no prospect for        reconciliation. (ix)            With respect to the issue of enhancement of maintenance for the son, the        Respondent is at liberty to move the Family Court for the said relief. We cannot        grant this relief in the present appeal, as it has been filed by the husband. (x)             In the facts and circumstances of the case, we order and direct that :        (a)      The Judgment and order dated 24.08.2015 passed by the Family Court,              Nagpur, affirmed by the Bombay High Court, Nagpur Bench vide Order              dated 14.08.2018 for payment of interim maintenance @ Rs.15,000 p.m. to              the Respondent No.1-wife, and Rs.10,000 p.m. to the Respondent No.2-son,              is hereby affirmed by this Court;        (b)      The husband is directed to pay the entire arrears of maintenance @              Rs.15,000 p.m., within a period of 12 weeks’ from the date of this Judgment,              and continue to comply with this Order during the pendency of the              proceedings u/S. 125 Cr.P.C. before the Family Court;                                                     5 (c)      If the Appellant-husband fails to comply with the aforesaid directions of       this Court, it would be open to the respondents to have the Order enforced       u/S.128 Cr.P.C., and take recourse to all other remedies which are available       in accordance with law; (d)      The proceedings for payment of interim maintenance u/S. 125 Cr.P.C.       have been pending between the parties for a period of over 7 years now. We       deem it appropriate that the Family Court decides the substantive application       u/S. 125 Cr.P.C. in Petition No. E-443/ 2013 finally, in light of the directions       / guidelines issued in the present judgment, within a period of 6 months’ from       the date of this judgment.          The Registry is directed to forward a complete copy of the pleadings,       alongwith the written submissions filed by the parties, and the record of the       proceedings in the present Criminal Appeal, to the Family Court, Nagpur.       The present Criminal Appeal is disposed of accordingly.                                                6                                           PART B           Given the backdrop of the facts of the present case, which reveal that the application for interim maintenance under Section 125 Cr.P.C. has remained pending before the Courts for seven years now, and the difficulties encountered in the enforcement of orders passed by the Courts, as the wife was constrained to move successive applications for enforcement from time to time, we deem it appropriate to frame guidelines on the issue of maintenance, which would cover overlapping jurisdiction under different enactments for payment of maintenance, payment of Interim Maintenance, the criteria for determining the quantum of maintenance, the date from which maintenance is to be awarded, and enforcement of orders of maintenance.                        Guidelines / Directions on Maintenance            Maintenance laws have been enacted as a measure of social justice to provide recourse to dependant wives and children for their financial support, so as to prevent them from falling into destitution and vagrancy.           Article 15(3) of the Constitution of India provides that :           “Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from making any special           provision for women and children.”            Article 15 (3) reinforced by Article 39 of the Constitution of India, which envisages a positive role for the State in fostering change towards the empowerment of women, led to the enactment of various legislations from time to time.           Justice Krishna Iyer in his judgment in Captain Ramesh Chander Kaushal v Mrs. Veena Kaushal & Ors.1 held that the object of maintenance laws is :         “9. This provision is a measure of social justice and specially enacted to         protect women and children and falls within the constitutional sweep of         Article 15(3) reinforced by Article 39. We have no doubt that sections of         statutes calling for construction by courts are not petrified print but vibrant         words with social functions to fulfil. The brooding presence of the         constitutional empathy for the weaker sections like women and children         must inform interpretation if it has to have social relevance. So viewed, it is   1     (1978) 4 SCC 70.                                                7               possible to be selective in picking out that interpretation out of two               alternatives which advances the cause — the cause of the derelicts.”                  The legislations which have been framed on the issue of maintenance are       the Special Marriage Act 1954 (“SMA”), Section 125 of the Cr.P.C. 1973; and       the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 (“D.V. Act”) which       provide a statutory remedy to women, irrespective of the religious community       to which they belong, apart from the personal laws applicable to various religious       communities. I                              Issue of Overlapping Jurisdiction                 Maintenance may be claimed under one or more of the afore-mentioned       statutes, since each of these enactments provides an independent and distinct       remedy framed with a specific object and purpose. For instance, a Hindu wife       may claim maintenance under the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act 1956       (“HAMA”), and also in a substantive proceeding for either dissolution of       marriage, or restitution of conjugal rights, etc. under the Hindu Marriage Act,       1955 (“HMA”) by invoking Sections 24 and 25 of the said Act. (i)             In Nanak Chand v Chandra Kishore Aggarwal & Ors. 2 , the Supreme       Court held that there was no inconsistency between the Cr.P.C. and HAMA.       Section 4(b) of HAMA would not repeal or affect the provisions of Section 488       of the old Cr.P.C. It was held that :               “4. Both can stand together. The Maintenance Act is an act to amend and               codify the law relating to adoptions and maintenance among Hindus. The               law was substantially similar before and nobody ever suggested that Hindu               Law, as in force immediately before the commencement of this Act, insofar               as it dealt with the maintenance of children, was in any way inconsistent               with Section 488, Cr.P.C. The scope of the two laws is different. Section 488               provides a summary remedy and is applicable to all persons belonging to               all religions and has no relationship with the personal law of the parties.               Recently the question came before the Allahabad High Court in Ram Singh               v. State: AIR1963All355, before the Calcutta High Court in Mahabir               Agarwalla v. Gita Roy [1962] 2 Cr. L.J.528 and before the Patna High               Court in Nalini Ranjan v. Kiran Rani: AIR1965Pat442. The three High               Courts have, in our view, correctly come to the conclusion that Section 4(b)               of the Maintenance Act does not repeal or affect in any manner the               provisions contained in Section 488, Cr.P.C.”                                                                     (emphasis supplied)       2           (1969) 3 SCC 802.                                                     8           While it is true that a party is not precluded from approaching the Court    under one or more enactments, since the nature and purpose of the relief under    each Act is distinct and independent, it is equally true that the simultaneous    operation of these Acts, would lead to multiplicity of proceedings and conflicting    orders. This would have the inevitable effect of overlapping jurisdiction. This    process requires to be streamlined, so that the respondent / husband is not    obligated to comply with successive orders of maintenance passed under    different enactments.           For instance, if in a previous proceeding under Section 125 Cr.P.C., an     amount is awarded towards maintenance, in the subsequent proceeding filed     for dissolution of marriage under the Hindu Marriage Act, where an application     for maintenance pendente lite is filed under Section 24 of that Act, or for     maintenance under Section 25, the payment awarded in the earlier proceeding     must be taken note of, while deciding the amount awarded under HMA.                   Statutory provisions under various enactments (a) The Special Marriage Act, 1954 (“SMA”)           Section 4 of the Special Marriage Act, 1954 provides that a marriage    between any two persons who are citizens of India may be solemnised under this    Act, notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in    force. It is a secular legislation applicable to all persons who solemnize their    marriage in India.           Section 36 of the Special Marriage Act provides that a wife is entitled to    claim pendente lite maintenance, if she does not have sufficient independent    income to support her and for legal expenses. The maintenance may be granted    on a weekly or monthly basis during the pendency of the matrimonial    proceedings. The Court would determine the quantum of maintenance depending    on the income of the husband, and award such amount as may seem reasonable.       Section 36 reads as:         “S.36. Alimony pendente lite.—Where in any proceeding under Chapter V         or Chapter VI it appears to the district court that the wife has no         independent income sufficient for her support and the necessary expenses                                             9        of the proceeding, it may, on the application of the wife, order the husband        to pay her the expenses of the proceeding, and weekly or monthly during        the proceeding such sum as, having regard to the husband’s income, it may        seem to the court to be reasonable.        Provided that the application for the payment of the expenses of the        proceeding and such weekly or monthly sum during the proceeding under        Chapter V or Chapter VI, shall, as far as possible, be disposed of within        sixty days from the date of service of notice on the husband.”           Section 37 provides for grant of permanent alimony at the time of passing   of the decree, or subsequent thereto. Permanent alimony is the consolidated   payment made by the husband to the wife towards her maintenance for life.   Section 37 reads as:        “S. 37. Permanent alimony and maintenance.—(1) Any court exercising        jurisdiction under Chapter V or Chapter VI may, at the time of passing any        decree or at any time subsequent to the decree, on application made to it        for the purpose, order that the husband shall secure to the wife for her        maintenance and support if necessary, by a charge on the husband’s        property such gross sum or such monthly or periodical payment of money        for a term not exceeding her life, as, having regard to her own property, if        any, her husband’s property and ability, the conduct of the parties and other        circumstances of the case, as it may seem to the court to be just.        (2) If the district court is satisfied that there is a change in the circumstances        of either party at any time after it has made an order under sub-Section (1),        it may, at the instance of either party, vary, modify or rescind any such order        in such manner as it may seem to the court to be just.        (3) If the district court is satisfied that the wife in whose favour an order        has been made under this Section has remarried or is not leading a chaste        life, it may, at the instance of the husband, vary, modify or rescind any such        order and in such manner as the court may deem just.”  (b) The Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 (“HMA”)          The HMA is a complete code which provides for the rights, liabilities and   obligations arising from a marriage between two Hindus. Sections 24 and 25   make provision for maintenance to a party who has no independent income   sufficient for his or her support, and necessary expenses. This is a gender-neutral   provision, where either the wife or the husband may claim maintenance. The pre-   requisite is that the applicant does not have independent income which is   sufficient for her or his support, during the pendency of the lis.                                                10        Section 24 of the HMA provides for maintenance pendente lite, where the Court may direct the respondent to pay the expenses of the proceeding, and pay such reasonable monthly amount, which is considered to be reasonable, having regard to the income of both the parties.        Section 24 reads as:      “24. Maintenance pendente lite and expenses of proceedings.—      Where in any proceeding under this Act it appears to the court that either      the wife or the husband, as the case may be, has no independent income      sufficient for her or his support and the necessary expenses of the      proceeding, it may, on the application of the wife or the husband, order the      respondent to pay to the petitioner the expenses of the proceeding, and      monthly during the proceeding such sum as, having regard to the      petitioner’s own income and the income of the respondent, it may seem to      the court to be reasonable.      Provided that the application for the payment of the expenses of the      proceeding and such monthly sum during the proceeding, shall, as far as      possible, be disposed of within sixty days from the date of service of notice      on the wife or the husband, as the case may be.”                                                               (emphasis supplied)        The proviso to Section 24 providing a time line of 60 days for disposal of the application was inserted vide Act 49 of 2001 w.e.f. 24.09.2001.        Section 25 provides for grant of permanent alimony, which reads as :      “25. Permanent alimony and maintenance —      (1) Any court exercising jurisdiction under this Act may, at the time of      passing any decree or at any time subsequent thereto, on application made      to it for the purpose by either the wife or the husband, as the case may be,      order that the respondent shall pay to the applicant for her or his      maintenance and support such gross sum or such monthly or periodical sum      for a term not exceeding the life of the applicant as, having regard to the      respondent's own income and other property, if any, the income and other      property of the applicant, the conduct of the parties and other      circumstances of the case, it may seem to the court to be just, and any such      payment may be secured, if necessary, by a charge on the immovable      property of the respondent.      (2) If the court is satisfied that there is, a change in the circumstances of      either party at any time after it has made an order under sub-section (1), it      may at the instance of either party, vary, modify or rescind any such order      in such manner as the court may deem just.      (3) If the court is satisfied that the party in whose favour an order has been      made under this section has remarried or, if such party is the wife, that she                                            11        has not remained chaste, or, if such party is the husband, that he has had        sexual intercourse with any woman outside wedlock, it may at the instance        of the other party vary, modify or rescind any such order in such manner as        the court may deem just.”                                                               (emphasis supplied)         Section 26 of the HMA provides that the Court may from time to time pass   interim orders with respect to the custody, maintenance and education of the   minor children.  (c) Hindu Adoptions & Maintenance Act, 1956 (“HAMA”)        HAMA is a special legislation which was enacted to amend and codify the   laws relating to adoption and maintenance amongst Hindus, during the   subsistence of the marriage. Section 18 provides that a Hindu wife shall be   entitled to be maintained by her husband during her lifetime. She is entitled to   make a claim for a separate residence, without forfeiting her right to   maintenance. Section 18 read in conjunction with Section 23 states the factors   required to be considered for deciding the quantum of maintenance to be paid.   Under sub-section (2) of Section 18, the husband has the obligation to maintain   his wife, even though she may be living separately. The right of separate   residence and maintenance would however not be available if the wife has been   unchaste, or has converted to another religion.        Section 18 reads as follows :        “18. Maintenance of wife.—        (1) Subject to the provisions of this section, a Hindu wife, whether married        before or after the commencement of this Act, shall be entitled to be        maintained by her husband during her lifetime.        (2) A Hindu wife shall be entitled to live separately from her husband        without forfeiting her claim to maintenance—        (a) if he is guilty of desertion, that is to say, of abandoning her without        reasonable cause and without her consent or against her wish or willfully        neglecting her;        (b) if he has treated her with such cruelty as to cause a reasonable        apprehension in her mind that it will be harmful or injurious to live with        her husband;        (c) [****]        (d) if he has any other wife living;                                              12         (e) if he keeps a concubine in the same house in which his wife is living or         habitually resides with a concubine elsewhere;         (f) if he has ceased to be a Hindu by conversion to another religion;         (g) if there is any other cause justifying living separately.         (3) A Hindu wife shall not be entitled to separate residency and         maintenance from her husband if she is unchaste or ceases to be a Hindu         by conversion to another religion.”             The distinction between maintenance under HMA and HAMA is that the right under Section 18 of HAMA is available during the subsistence of a marriage, without any matrimonial proceeding pending between the parties. Once there is a divorce, the wife has to seek relief under Section 25 of HMA. 3           Under HMA, either the wife, or the husband, may move for judicial separation, restitution of conjugal rights, dissolution of marriage, payment of interim maintenance under Section 24, and permanent alimony under Section 25 of the Act, whereas under Section 18 of HAMA, only a wife may seek maintenance.           The interplay between the claim for maintenance under HMA and HAMA came up for consideration by the Supreme Court in Chand Dhawan v Jawaharlal Dhawan.4 The Supreme Court, while considering the various laws relating to marriage amongst Hindus, discussed the scope of applications under the HMA and HAMA in the following words :         “23. …Section 18(1) of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956         entitles a Hindu wife to claim maintenance from her husband during her         life-time. Sub-section (2) of Section 18 grants her the right to live         separately, without forfeiting her claim to maintenance, if he is guilty of any         of the misbehaviors enumerated therein or on account of his being in one of         objectionable conditions as mentioned therein. So while sustaining her         marriage and preserving her marital status, the wife is entitled to claim         maintenance from her husband. On the other hand, under the Hindu         Marriage Act, in contrast, her claim for maintenance pendente lite is         durated on the pendency of a litigation of the kind envisaged under Sections         9 to 14 of the Hindu Marriage Act, and her claim to permanent maintenance         or alimony is based on the supposition that either her marital status has         been strained or affected by passing a decree for restitution of conjugal         rights or judicial separation in favour or against her, or her marriage         stands dissolved by a decree of nullity or divorce, with or without her  3      Panditrao Chimaji Kalure v Gayabai (2002) 2 Mah LJ 53. 4     (1993) 3 SCC 406.                                                   13         consent. Thus when her marital status is to be affected or disrupted the court         does so by passing a decree for or against her. On or at the time of the         happening of that event, the court being seized of the matter, invokes its         ancillary or incidental power to grant permanent alimony. Not only that,         the court retains the jurisdiction at subsequent stages to fulfill this         incidental or ancillary obligation when moved by an application on that         behalf by a party entitled to relief. The court further retains the power to         change"" or alter the order in view of the changed circumstances. Thus the         whole exercise is within the gammit of a diseased or a broken marriage.         And in order to avoid conflict of perceptions the legislature while codifying         the Hindu Marriage Act preserved the right of permanent maintenance in         favour of the husband or the wife, as the case may be, dependent on the         court passing a decree of the kind as envisaged under Sections 9 to 14 of         the Act. In other words without the marital status being affected or; disputed         by the matrimonial court under the Hindu Marriage Act the claim of         permanent alimony was not to be valid as ancillary or incidental to such         affectation or disruption. The wife's claim to maintenance necessarily has         then to be agitated under the Hindu Adoptions and"

(MD) No.         11620 of 2009 filed by S. Janaki, the first respondent before us,         directs the Inspector of Police, City Crime Branch, K.K. Nagar,         Trichy to register a case, that is, First Information Report, on the         basis of the complaint dated 18.09.2008 and after investigation file         the final report in accordance with law.   2.     Aggrieved, Mr. M. Subramaniam and Mr. R.V. Prasanna         Venkatesan who were not even made parties to the aforesaid         Criminal O.P. (MD) No. 11620 of 2009 have filed the present         petition under Article 136 of the Constitution of India. By order         dated 12.03.2010, the permission to file Special Leave Petition         was granted and notice was issued. On considering the facts and Criminal Appeal No. 102 of 2011                                   Page 1 of 8        assertions made, it was directed that in the meanwhile operation         of the impugned judgment would be stayed.   3.     In spite of the aforesaid stay, it appears that the Inspector of         Police, City Crime Branch, K.K. Nagar, Trichy on 05.04.2010 had         registered an FIR in Crime No. 7 of 2010 under Sections 403, 406,         408, 418(i), 420, 424 and 465 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860         against the two appellants and three others. During the course of         the hearing before us, the appellants have produced a copy of the         order dated 18.02.2019 passed by the Madurai Bench of Madras         High Court in Criminal O.P. (MD) No. 5195 of 2010 and M.P.(MD)         No. 1 of 2010 filed by the appellants and three others against the         two respondents. By this order, the petition was partly allowed         with the direction that the aforesaid case registered as Crime No.         7 of 2010 will be treated as closed. In the event of this Court         dismissing the present S.L.P., the police would proceed with the         investigation in Crime No. 7 of 2010 and take it to its logical         conclusion by either filing charge-sheet or a final closure report as         the case may be. It stands specifically directed that the police         would not proceed further with the investigation till the decision of         the present S.L.P.   4.     As per the appellants, the first respondent was one of the trustees         in ADS Educational Trust which was founded in 1985 for the Criminal Appeal No. 102 of 2011                                    Page 2 of 8        purposes of giving and promoting education.                The trust had         started Sri Angalamman College of Engineering and Technology         at Trichy in 1987. The first and second appellants before us are         the Chairman and the Vice-Chairman respectively of this College.         The appellants have submitted that the first respondent has no         locus standi to file a criminal complaint and the complaint is         intended only to wreak vengeance in view of the civil dispute,         which is pending between the parties. The first respondent, it is         alleged, was removed from service as she was found guilty of         fraud and forgery.    5.     While it is not possible to accept the contention of the appellants         on the question of locus standi, we are inclined to accept the         contention that the High Court could not have directed the         registration of an FIR with a direction to the police to investigate         and file the final report in view of the judgment of this Court in         Sakiri Vasu v. State Of Uttar Pradesh And Others 1 in which it         has been inter alia held as under:                   “11. In this connection we would like to state that if a                  person has a grievance that the police station is not                  registering his FIR under Section 154 CrPC, then he                  can approach the Superintendent of Police under                  Section 154(3) CrPC by an application in writing. Even                  if that does not yield any satisfactory result in the sense                  that either the FIR is still not registered, or that even                  after registering it no proper investigation is held, it is                  open to the aggrieved person to file an application  1  (2008) 2 SCC 409 Criminal Appeal No. 102 of 2011                                           Page 3 of 8                  under Section 156(3) CrPC before the learned                  Magistrate concerned. If such an application under                  Section 156(3) is filed before the Magistrate, the                  Magistrate can direct the FIR to be registered and also                  can direct a proper investigation to be made, in a case                  where, according to the aggrieved person, no proper                  investigation was made. The Magistrate can also under                  the same provision monitor the investigation to ensure                  a proper investigation.                   12. Thus in Mohd. Yousuf v. Afaq Jahan this Court                  observed: (SCC p. 631, para 11)                      “11. The clear position therefore is that any                     Judicial Magistrate, before taking cognizance of                     the offence, can order investigation under Section                     156(3) of the Code. If he does so, he is not to                     examine the complainant on oath because he                     was not taking cognizance of any offence therein.                     For the purpose of enabling the police to start                     investigation it is open to the Magistrate to direct                     the police to register an FIR. There is nothing                     illegal in doing so. After all registration of an FIR                     involves only the process of entering the                     substance of the information relating to the                     commission of the cognizable offence in a book                     kept by the officer in charge of the police station                     as indicated in Section 154 of the Code. Even if a                     Magistrate does not say in so many words while                     directing investigation under Section 156(3) of the                     Code that an FIR should be registered, it is the                     duty of the officer in charge of the police station to                     register the FIR regarding the cognizable offence                     disclosed by the complainant because that police                     officer could take further steps contemplated in                     Chapter XII of the Code only thereafter.”                   13. The same view was taken by this Court in Dilawar                  Singh v. State of Delhi (JT vide para 17). We would                  further clarify that even if an FIR has been registered                  and even if the police has made the investigation, or is                  actually making the investigation, which the aggrieved                  person feels is not proper, such a person can approach                  the Magistrate under Section 156(3) CrPC, and if the                  Magistrate is satisfied he can order a proper                  investigation and take other suitable steps and pass                  such order(s) as he thinks necessary for ensuring a                  proper investigation. All these powers a Magistrate                  enjoys under Section 156(3) CrPC. Criminal Appeal No. 102 of 2011                                              Page 4 of 8                  14. Section 156(3) states:                      “156. (3) Any Magistrate empowered under                     Section 190 may order such an investigation as                     abovementioned.”                   The words “as abovementioned” obviously refer to                  Section 156(1), which contemplates investigation by                  the officer in charge of the police station.                   15. Section 156(3) provides for a check by the                  Magistrate on the police performing its duties under                  Chapter XII CrPC. In cases where the Magistrate finds                  that the police has not done its duty of investigating the                  case at all, or has not done it satisfactorily, he can                  issue a direction to the police to do the investigation                  properly, and can monitor the same.                   16. The power in the Magistrate to order further                  investigation under Section 156(3) is an independent                  power and does not affect the power of the                  investigating officer to further investigate the case even                  after submission of his report vide Section 173(8).                  Hence the Magistrate can order reopening of the                  investigation even after the police submits the final                  report, vide State of Bihar v. J.A.C. Saldanha (SCC :                  AIR para 19).                   17. In our opinion Section 156(3) CrPC is wide enough                  to include all such powers in a Magistrate which are                  necessary for ensuring a proper investigation, and it                  includes the power to order registration of an FIR and                  of ordering a proper investigation if the Magistrate is                  satisfied that a proper investigation has not been done,                  or is not being done by the police. Section 156(3)                  CrPC, though briefly worded, in our opinion, is very                  wide and it will include all such incidental powers as                  are necessary for ensuring a proper investigation.                   18. It is well settled that when a power is given to an                  authority to do something it includes such incidental or                  implied powers which would ensure the proper doing of                  that thing. In other words, when any power is expressly                  granted by the statute, there is impliedly included in the                  grant, even without special mention, every power and                  every control the denial of which would render the                  grant itself ineffective. Thus where an Act confers                  jurisdiction it impliedly also grants the power of doing Criminal Appeal No. 102 of 2011                                          Page 5 of 8                  all such acts or employ such means as are essentially                  necessary for its execution.”   6.     The said ratio has been followed in Sudhir Bhaskarrao Tambe v.         Hemant Yashwant Dhage and Others2, in which it is observed.                   “2. This Court has held in Sakiri Vasu v. State of U.P.,                  that if a person has a grievance that his FIR has not                  been registered by the police, or having been                  registered, proper investigation is not being done, then                  the remedy of the aggrieved person is not to go to the                  High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of                  India, but to approach the Magistrate concerned under                  Section 156(3) CrPC. If such an application under                  Section 156(3) CrPC is made and the Magistrate is,                  prima facie, satisfied, he can direct the FIR to be                  registered, or if it has already been registered, he can                  direct proper investigation to be done which includes in                  his discretion, if he deems it necessary, recommending                  change of the investigating officer, so that a proper                  investigation is done in the matter. We have said this                  in Sakiri Vasu case because what we have found in                  this country is that the High Courts have been flooded                  with writ petitions praying for registration of the first                  information report or praying for a proper investigation.                   3. We are of the opinion that if the High Courts                  entertain such writ petitions, then they will be flooded                  with such writ petitions and will not be able to do any                  other work except dealing with such writ petitions.                  Hence, we have held that the complainant must avail of                  his alternate remedy to approach the Magistrate                  concerned under Section 156(3) CrPC and if he does                  so, the Magistrate will ensure, if prima facie he is                  satisfied, registration of the first information report and                  also ensure a proper investigation in the matter, and he                  can also monitor the investigation.                   4. In view of the settled position in Sakiri Vasu case,                  the impugned judgment of the High Court cannot be                  sustained and is hereby set aside. The Magistrate                  concerned is directed to ensure proper investigation                  into the alleged offence under Section 156(3) CrPC                  and if he deems it necessary, he can also recommend                  to the SSP/SP concerned a change of the investigating 2  (2016) 6 SCC 277 Criminal Appeal No. 102 of 2011                                           Page 6 of 8                  officer, so that a proper investigation is done. The                  Magistrate can also monitor the investigation, though                  he cannot himself investigate (as investigation is the                  job of the police). Parties may produce any material                  they wish before the Magistrate concerned. The                  learned Magistrate shall be uninfluenced by any                  observation in the impugned order of the High Court.”   7.     We are also surprised and concerned at the registration of the FIR         in Crime No. 7 of 2010, notwithstanding, the stay order passed by         this Court while issuing notice by which the operation of the         impugned judgment was directed to remain stayed.   8.     In these circumstances, we would allow the present appeal and         set aside the direction of the High Court for registration of the FIR         and investigation into the matter by the police. At the same time,         our order would not be an impediment in the way of the first         respondent filing documents and papers with the police pursuant         to the complaint dated 18.09.2008 and the police on being         satisfied that a criminal offence is made out would have liberty to         register an FIR. It is also open to the first respondent to approach         the court of the metropolitan magistrate if deemed appropriate and         necessary. Equally, it will be open to the appellants and others to         take steps to protect their interest.   9.     We would clarify that this Court has not expressed any opinion on         merits and whether or not the complaint discloses any criminal         offence. The only clarification that is required is that a civil dispute Criminal Appeal No. 102 of 2011                                       Page 7 of 8        should not be given the colour of a criminal offence, and at the         same time mere pendency of the civil proceeding is not a good         ground and justification to not register and investigate an FIR if a         criminal offence has been committed.   10.    Recording the aforesaid, the present appeal is partly allowed.                                                     …………………………, J.                                                     (N.V.

State of Punjab (2018) 4 SCC 303, the following questions  are referred for consideration by a larger Bench:       “(1) Whether the protection granted to a person under      Section 438 Cr.P.C. should be limited to a fixed period so      as to enable the person to surrender before the Trial      Court and seek regular bail.      (2)    Whether the life of an anticipatory bail should end      at the time and stage when the accused is summoned by      the court.”   2.    Shri Harin P. Raval, learned Senior Advocate appearing as  Amicus Curiae relying upon the decision of this Court in the case  of Balchand Jain v. State of M.P. (1976) 4 SCC 572 has submitted  that though the expression “anticipatory bail” has not been  defined in the Code, as observed by this Court in the aforesaid  decision, “anticipatory bail” means “bail in anticipation of arrest”.  It is submitted that in the aforesaid decision, this Court has  further observed that the expression “anticipatory bail” is a                                                                    2 misnomer inasmuch as it is not as if bail is presently granted by  the Court in anticipation of arrest. It is submitted that when a  competent court grants “anticipatory bail”, it makes an order that  in the event of arrest, a person shall be released on bail. It is  submitted that there is no question of release on bail unless a  person is arrested and, therefore, it is only on arrest that the  order granting “anticipatory bail” becomes operative.  2.1. Shri Raval, learned Amicus Curiae has taken us to the  historical perspective on the inclusion of Section 438 of the Cr.  P.C.   It is submitted that on the recommendation of the Law  Commission of India in its 41st Report dated 24.09.1969, the  Parliament   introduced    a   new   provision   in   the   form   of  “anticipatory bail” under Section 438 of the Cr.P.C.           It is  submitted that the Law Commission of India in its 41 st Report  stated in paragraph 39.9 the justification for power to grant  “anticipatory bail”.    It is submitted that as per the Law  Commission the necessity for granting “anticipatory bail” arises  mainly because sometimes influential persons try to implicate  their rivals in false cases for the purpose of disgracing them or for  other purposes by getting them detained in jail for some days. It                                                                       3 is submitted that the Law Commission further observed that with  the accentuation of political rivalry, this tendency is showing  signs of steady increase. Apart from false cases, where there are  reasonable grounds for holding that a person accused of an  offence is not likely to abscond, or otherwise misuse his liberty,  while on bail, there seems to be no justification to require him to  first submit to custody, remain in prison for some days, and then  apply for bail.  2.2   It is further submitted that power to grant “anticipatory bail”  vests only in the High Courts or the Courts of Sessions.        It is  submitted that the “anticipatory bail” can be applied at different  stages. It is submitted that even in a case where no FIR is lodged  and a person is apprehending his arrest in case the FIR is lodged,  in that case, he can apply for “anticipatory bail” and after notice  to the Public Prosecutor the Court can grant “anticipatory bail”.  It is submitted that even in a case where the FIR is lodged but the  investigation has not yet begun, i.e., pre investigation stage, the  “anticipatory bail” can be applied.         It is submitted that  “anticipatory bail” can also be applied at post investigation stage.  It is submitted that after exercising the discretion judiciously, the                                                                       4 High Court or the Sessions Court grants “anticipatory bail” and  that too after hearing the Public Prosecutor. It is submitted that  therefore once the bail is granted in anticipation of the arrest,  there is no reason to limit the same till the summon is issued by  the Court and/or there is no reason to limit the period of bail in  anticipation granted.  2.3   Shri Harin P. Raval, learned Senior Advocate appearing as  Amicus Curiae has further submitted that in the case of  Gurbaksh Singh Sibbia (supra), a Constitution Bench of this Court  has observed and held that the facility which Section 438, Cr.  P.C. affords is generally referred to as “anticipatory bail”, an  expression which was used by the Law Commission in its 41 st  Report. Neither the section nor its marginal note so describes it  but, the expression “anticipatory bail” is a convenient mode of  conveying that it is possible to apply for bail in anticipation of  arrest. It is submitted that any order of bail can, of course, be  effective only from the date of arrest because to grant bail as  stated in Wharton’s Law Lexicon, is to “set at liberty a person  arrested   or   imprisoned,   on   security   being   taken   for   his  appearance”. It is submitted that thus, bail is basically release                                                                         5 from restraint, more particularly, release from the custody of the  police.   It is submitted that the act of arrest directly affects  freedom of movement of the person arrested by the police, and  speaking generally, an order of bail gives back to the accused that  freedom on condition that he will appear to take his trial. Taking  a surety, bonds and such other modalities are the means by  which an assurance is secured from the accused that though he  has been released on bail, he will present himself at the trial of  the offence or offences of which he is charged and for which he  was arrested.   It is submitted that the distinction between an  ordinary order of bail and an order of anticipatory bail is that  whereas the former is granted after arrest and therefore means  release from the custody of the police, the latter is granted in  anticipation of arrest and is therefore effective at the very moment  of arrest. It is submitted that in other words, unlike a post­arrest  order of bail, it is a pre­arrest legal process which directs that if  the person in whose favour it is issued is thereafter arrested on  the accusation in respect of which the direction is issued, he shall  be released on bail.                                                                        6 2.4   Shri Harin P. Raval, learned Senior Advocate appearing as  Amicus Curiae has further submitted that however the core  questions before this Court are, (a) what is the life or currency of  an anticipatory bail once the same has been granted by the  competent court?; (b) once an order granting anticipatory bail has  been passed, whether the said anticipatory bail only survives till  the stage of filing of charge sheet/challan/final report or whether  it subsists during the entire duration of trial?.     It is further  submitted by Shri Raval that one another question may arise,  namely, in a case where if new incriminating materials are found  during the course of investigation, whether they could be relied  on by the Court to cancel anticipatory bail which has already  been granted?  2.5   It is submitted that, as such, the aforesaid questions are not  res integra in view of the decision of the Constitution Bench of  this Court in the case of Gurbaksh Singh Sibbia (supra).       It is  submitted that in the case of Gurbaksh Singh Sibbia (supra), a  Constitution Bench of this Court has held that there is no limit to  the currency of an order of anticipatory bail. The Court is vested  with absolute discretion to direct the duration of the trial which                                                                     7 can vary from a few weeks to even such duration until charge  sheet has been filed and which may also extend to the entire  duration of the trial. It is submitted that it is further observed  that the sole consideration must be with a view to balance the  two competing interests, viz., protecting the liberty of the accused  and the sovereign power of the police to conduct a fair  investigation.   Shri Raval, learned Amicus Curiae has heavily  relied upon the observations made by the Constitution Bench of  this Court in paragraphs 42 & 43 of Gurbaksh Singh Sibbia  (supra).   2.6   It is further submitted by Shri Raval that in the subsequent  decision of this Court in the case of Siddharam Satlingappa  Mhetre (supra), this Court has taken the view that the order of  anticipatory bail once granted ordinarily subsists during the  entire duration of the trial.   It is submitted that it is further  observed that by that the power of the Sessions Court or that of  the High Court to re­visit its order granting anticipatory bail is  curtailed, in case circumstances exist or new exigencies arise  which merit interference.       Heavy reliance is placed upon  observations made by this Court in the case of Siddharam                                                                     8 Satlingappa Mhetre (supra) in paragraphs 94, 95, 98, 100, 122  and 123.       It is submitted by Shri Raval that however, the judgment  rendered in Siddharam Satlingappa Mhetre (supra) particularly in  paragraphs   95,   108,     122   and   123   does   not   take   into  consideration the observations of the Constitution Bench in  Gurbaksh Singh Sibbia (supra) in paragraphs 42 & 43, which  clearly cull out that the discretion of the Sessions Court or a High  Court is wide enough to limit as well as specify the duration of  the anticipatory bail taking into account all relevant factors which  may persuade the discretion of the Court. It is submitted that  Siddharam Satlingappa Mhetre (supra) proceeded to hold that the  anticipatory bail shall subsists during the entire currency of the  trial and specifically rejected the notion that anticipatory bail  could be for a limited time as well, on the expiry of which the  accused must surrender and apply for a regular bail.              It is  submitted that in view of the conflicting approach, the decision  rendered in the case of Siddharam Satlingappa Mhetre (supra)  particularly the observations made in paragraphs 95, 108, 122 &  123 need to be revisited.                                                                        9 2.7   It is further submitted by Shri Raval, learned Amicus Curiae  that the discretion of the Sessions Court and the High Court is  absolute, and no limitations whatsoever have been imposed by  the legislature. It is submitted that the discretion therefore can  be exercised to even limit the duration of the anticipatory bail, in  order to ensure that the accused also cooperates with the  investigation, or that relevant discoveries to secure incriminating  material could be made under Section 27 of the Evidence Act, or  in view of new incriminating circumstances which establish  complicity of the accused. It is submitted that therefore the view  taken by this Court in Siddharam Satlingappa Mhetre (supra) that  the anticipatory bail to subsist for the entire duration of the trial,  curtails the discretion of the Sessions Court or the High Court to  limit such duration of anticipatory bail. It is submitted that such  an interpretation is in absolute contravention of the law declared  by the Constitution Bench in the case of Gurbaksh Singh Sibia  (supra).   2.8   Making the above submissions and relying upon the  aforesaid decisions of the Constitution Bench of this Court, Shri  Raval, learned Amicus Curiae has concluded as under:                                                                      10 1)    that the power vested by the Parliament on superior  criminal courts in the order of hierarchy, such as Sessions  Court and High Court, is a power entailing conferment of  absolute discretion in deciding whether an application for  anticipatory bail may be allowed or rejected, and also inheres  in this discretion, the additional power to limit the duration of  anticipatory bail to any point in time, or to any stage as the  Courts may deem fit in the facts and circumstances of the  case, and in view of all the attending circumstances;  2)    that the order granting anticipatory bail will not  interdict the power of the investigating agency to continue  investigation of the case or would prevent the investigating  agency to ask for and be granted, respectively, Police Custody  of the accused for the purposes of the investigation and  where the investigating officer feels that the custody of the  accused is necessary.    Further since police custody can be  granted only in the first 14 days of the arrest, the decision to  restrict the duration of the bail would balance the twin  competing interest, viz., the individual liberty and the  sovereign power of the police to investigate the case;                                                                  11 3)    that the life of the order granting anticipatory bail can  be restricted, which may be at a stage till either the FIR is  filed in cases where such order is granted on an reasonable  apprehension of being arrested in relation to a cognizable  case, where the FIR or Complaint is yet not filed; in cases  where FIR or complaint is filed, it may be restricted to a  period of ten days after arrest (since it leaves a period of 4  days for the investigation agency to get police custody, within  the outer limit of 14 days) and then leave it open for the  accused so released on anticipatory bail to apply for regular  bail under Section 437/439; alternatively such order may  endure till filing of charge sheet which has to be filed within  90 days of the arrest. It may be remembered here that non­  filing of charge sheet within 90 days of arrest entitles the  accused, statutory bail or default bail, as a matter of right, in  view of express stipulation contained in Section 167 of the  Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.      Also, in case where an  accused is released on anticipatory bail, the investigation  authorities may not be subjected to adherence to filing of  charge sheet within 90 days as there would               be no  consequence as the accused is already enlarged on bail. It                                                                12 may therefore be safer to adhere to the earlier practice  evolved by judicial precedents to restrict the operation of life  of the order granting anticipatory bail for 10 days of arrest,  leaving it open to the accused to apply for regular bail under  Section 437/439 of the Code and equally leaving it open for  the Court to consider such an application without in any way  being influenced by the fact of grant of anticipatory bail, as at  that stage the considerations are at a very early stage where  the investigation itself may be in nascent stage or the  materials are yet to be gathered and the accused is yet to be  interrogated; and  4)    that anticipatory bail once granted can also be  cancelled, either in appeal to a superior forum on challenge  being made or by the same court on establishment of well  accepted   and    legally   enshrined   principles   relating   to  cancellation of bail.  3.    Shri K.V. Vishwanathan, learned Senior Advocate who  was also requested to assist us as an Amicus Curiae has  submitted that the exercise of power under Section 438 is  exactly like the exercise of power under Sections 437 and 439                                                                   13 of the Cr.P.C.   It is submitted therefore, the pre­arrest bail  granted in anticipation of arrest under Section 438 ought to  operate like any other order granting bail till an order of  conviction or till an affirmative direction is passed under  Section 439(2) of the Cr.P.C. It is submitted that therefore  the law laid down by this Court in the cases of Gurbaksh  Singh Sibbia (supra) and Siddharam Satlingappa Mhetre  (supra) lay down the correct law.    It is submitted that the  exceptions carved out in Gurbaksh Singh Sibbia (supra)  particularly in paras 19, 42 and 43 are well within the  scheme of the Code.  3.1   It is further submitted by Shri Vishwanathan, learned  Amicus Curiae that the power of arrest of the police is under  Section 41 of the Cr.P.C. It is submitted that this Section has  two essential parts.   One, relating to offences in which the  maximum punishment can extend to imprisonment for seven  years. Second, relating to offences in which the maximum  punishment can extent to imprisonment above seven years or  death penalty. It is submitted that though they have different  conditions and thresholds, in both cases it is clear from a                                                               14 bare reading of the section that the power of arrest cannot be  exercised in every FIR that is registered under Section 154  Cr.P.C. It is submitted that this power is circumscribed by  the conditions laid down in this Section.        Moreover, this  principle that the power of arrest is not required to be  exercised in every case was recognised in the cases of  Joginder Kumar v. State of U.P. (1994) 4 SCC 260 (para 20);  Lalitha Kumari v. State of U.P. (2014) 2 SCC 1 (paras 107­  108); and Arnesh Kumar v. State of Bihar (2014) 8 SCC 273  (paras 5 and 6). It is submitted that, in fact, this Court in the  case of M.C. Abraham v. State of Maharashtra (2003) 2 SCC  649 (para 15) has held that it was not mandatory for the  police to arrest a person only because his/her anticipatory  bail had been rejected.  3.2   It is further submitted by Shri Vishwanathan, learned  Amicus Curiae that the power of arrest is then further  circumscribed by Section 438 Cr.P.C. It is submitted that as  recognized by the Law Commission, there are cases where the  power of arrest is not required or allowed to be exercised. It  is submitted that exercising power of arrest in such cases                                                                 15 would be a grave violation of a person’s right and liberty. It is  submitted that such exercise of power would amount to  misuse of Section 41. It is submitted that the check on the  power of arrest and custody provided by Sections 437 or 439  is limited as the check is only post facto. It is submitted that  by then the person arrested has already suffered the trauma  and humiliation of arrest.  3.3   It is further submitted that to safeguard this situation,  Section 438 was introduced so as to provide for judicial  intervention in necessary cases.     It is submitted that this  judicial intervention is to ensure that the power of arrest is  regulated under the scrutiny of the courts. It is submitted  that to strike a further balance between the power of arrest  and the rights of the accused, this power was specifically  given to the Court of Session and the High Court so as to  ensure that this judicial intervention is done at the  supervisory level and not at the magisterial level.         It is  submitted that it is in this light that the two questions raised  in the present reference need to be addressed.                                                                   16 3.4   Taking us to the recommendations in the 41 st Report of  the Law Commission and the observations made in the  Report of the Committee on Reforms of the Criminal Justice  system, headed by Dr. Justice V.S. Malimath, it is submitted  by Shri Vishwanathan that Section 438 is a check on the  power of arrest of the police. It is submitted that as stated in  the above Law Commission Report, it is a check not only  against false cases, but also in cases where the need to arrest  does not arise.  3.5   It is further submitted that even otherwise a bare  reading of the Section shows that there is nothing in the  language of the Section which goes to show that the pre­  arrest bail granted under Section 438 has to be time­bound.  It is submitted that the position is the same as in Sections  437 and 439. It is submitted that at this stage Section 438(3)  is relevant to be taken into consideration.     It is submitted  that there are two very important aspects in Section 438(3)  Cr.P.C. which are relevant to be considered to understand the  scheme of the Code, viz., (a) a person in whose favour a pre­  arrest bail order has been made under Section 438 has first                                                                 17 to be arrested. Such a person is then released on bail on the  basis of the pre­arrest bail order. For such release the person  has to comply with the requirement of Section 441 of giving a  bond or surety; and (b) where the magistrate taking  cognizance under Section 204 is of the view that a warrant is  required to be issued at the first instance, such magistrate is  only empowered to issue only a bailable warrant and not a  non­bailable warrant.     This curtailment of power of the  magistrate clearly shows the intent of the legislature that a  person who has been granted bail under Section 438 ought  not to be arrested at the stage of cognizance because of the  said pre­arrest bail order.   It is submitted that in light of this  express provision, no other interpretation is possible to be  given to the said section.     It is submitted that the second  question referred herein is squarely covered by this sub­  section.  3.6   It is further submitted by Shri Vishwanathan, learned  Amicus Curiae that the order passed under Section 438,  which is in the nature of a pre­arrest bail order, is however  subject to the power granted to the Court of Session and the                                                                    18 High Court under Section 439(2), Cr.P.C., which gives power  to the Court of Session or the High Court to direct the arrest  of the accused at any time. It is submitted that this ensures  that through judicial intervention the balance between the  two competing principles can again be revisited if the need  arises.   It is submitted that the only difference is that the  power of arrest in these cases is exercised only after judicial  scrutiny. It is submitted that in any case and as observed by  this Court in Gurbaksh Singh Sibbia (supra), the orders once  passed under Section 438 will continue till the trial unless in  exercise of judicial discretion the Sessions Court or the High  Court limits the same, looking to the facts and circumstances  of the case and the stages at which the power under Section  438 Cr.P.C. is exercised.     It is submitted that the Code  presupposes that the order passed under Sections 438 or 439  are not or cannot be temporary time bound. It is submitted  that a person in whose favour an order of pre­arrest bail is  passed can be taken into custody thereafter only when a  specific direction is passed under Section 439(2) of the Code.                                                                 19 3.7   Shri Vishwanathan, learned Amicus Curiae, while  making the aforesaid submissions and relying upon the  aforesaid decisions of this Court, has concluded that the pre­  arrest bail granted under Section 438 of the Code is exactly  like the orders of bail passed under Sections 437 and 439 of  the Code; the Code does not contemplate any power in the  hands of the Courts to pass time­bound orders under Section  438 for good reason; on the other hand, the investigating  agency can approach the Court under Section 439(2) and in  the event of the police making out a case, the Court has all  the powers to direct the accused to be taken into custody.  4.    Shri Tushar Mehta, learned Solicitor General of India  has heavily relied upon paras 42 and 43 of Gurbaksh Singh  Sibbia (supra) and has submitted that as observed and held  by the Constitution Bench of this Court that the Court can in  a given case and for justifiable reasons limit the period of  anticipatory bail. It is submitted that this Court in the case  of   Siddharam Satlingappa Mhetre (supra) has misread the  judgment in Gurbaksh Singh Sibbia (supra) to a limited                                                                20 extent.   It is submitted that to the extent Siddharam  Satlingappa Mhetre (supra) states that “in view of the clear  declaration of the law by the Constitution Bench, the life of  the order under Section 438 Cr.P.C. granting bail cannot be  curtailed”, may not be correct law in light of the observations  made in para 42 by the Constitution Bench in Gurbaksh  Singh Sibbia (supra).   It is submitted that the Constitution  Bench in Gurbaksh Singh Sibbia (supra) has not categorically  barred anticipatory bail order for limited time period, and at  the same time, merely stated that “normal rule” should be not  to limit the time period.   It is submitted that at the same  time, the decision of this Court in the case of Salauddin  Abdulsamad Shaikh (supra), to the extent it states that the  order of the anticipatory bail has to be necessarily limited in  time frame is against the decision of the Constitution Bench  in Gurbaksh Singh Sibbia (supra), which specifically states  that the “normal rule” to not limit the order of anticipatory  bail. It is submitted that therefore the extreme views on both  side in Siddharam Satlingappa Mhetre (supra) and Salauddin  Abdulsamad Shaikh (supra), to that limited extent, do not                                                               21 consider the observations in Gurbaksh Singh Sibbia (supra),  in the correct light.   It is submitted that in a case, with  justifiable reasons, to be recorded in writing, indicating  reasons to deviate from the “normal rule”, the anticipatory  bail can be granted for a limited time period, the life of which,  would extinguish accordingly.  4.1   It is further submitted by Shri Tushar Mehta, learned  Solicitor General of India that so far as the second reference,  namely, whether the life of an anticipatory bail should end at  the time and stage when the accused is summoned by the  court is concerned, it is submitted that there cannot be a  straightjacket formula. It is submitted that in a case wherein  the anticipatory bail is granted for a limited time period, the  life would extinguish accordingly. It is submitted that in a  case wherein the anticipatory bail is granted without  conditions, the life may terminate upon the circumstances  warranting cancellation of such bail or such interference. It  is submitted that the statute does not contemplate an  automatic cancellation upon filing of charge sheet and  therefore the judgment of this Court in the case of HDFC                                                                  22 Bank Limited (supra), to that extent, may not lay down the  correct law.    It is submitted that, at the same time, the  Hon’ble Courts have deprecated the practice of blanket orders  of bail/anticipatory bail.   It is submitted that there are  eventualities arising in every case may be different and  therefore are required to be dealt with accordingly, in the  facts and circumstances of each case. It is submitted that  even while granting the anticipatory bail, the right of the  investigating agency to seek custodial interrogation cannot be  hampered mechanically.  5.    Relying upon the decisions of this Court in the cases of  HDFC Bank Ltd. (supra) and Satpal Singh (supra), it is  submitted by Shri Vikramjit Banerjee, learned Additional  Solicitor General of India that as held by this Court in the  aforesaid decisions, the purpose of Section 438 is providing  protection only during the process of investigation and the  accused should seek regular bail upon submission of the  charge sheet against him from the court where entire  material is placed. It is submitted that in any case grant of  the pre­arrest bail under Section 438 Cr.P.C. shall not affect                                                               23 the right of the investigating agency to seek custodial  interrogation and in conducting further investigation.  5.1   It is further submitted by Shri Banerjee, learned ASG  that as held by this Court in the case of Uday Mohanlal  Acharya v. State of Maharashtra (2001) 5 SCC 453, that even  when accused is found to be on bail at the stage of committal  proceedings, the committing Magistrate has the power to  cancel the bail and commit him to custody, if he considers it  necessary to do so. It is submitted that as observed and held  by this Court in the aforesaid decisions that an interpretation  that an order of protection from arrest under Section 438 will  remain operational till the end of the trial will effectively make  Section 209 (b) of Cr.P.C. otiose.  5.2   At the end, Shri Banerjee, learned ASG has submitted  that there should necessarily be conditions imposed in  granting a pre­arrest bail order and it cannot be a blanket  order; in terms of the Cr.P.C. under Section 209(b) and  Section 240(2), the accused can be remanded to custody by  the Magistrate during the stage of inquiry, if he considers it  necessary to do so at the stage of the submission of the final                                                                  24 report/ charge sheet or committal proceedings.           It is  submitted that it is imperative therefore that if the accused  takes pre­arrest bail during the earlier state of criminal  investigation, the power of the Magistrate under the said  provisions of Cr.P.C. should be maintained including the  power of the Magistrate to send the accused to the custody.  6.    Shri C.S.N. Mohan Rao, learned Advocate appearing on  behalf of respondent no.2 has vehemently submitted that the  Constitution Bench judgment in Gurbaksh Singh Sibbia  (supra) has dealt with various aspects of anticipatory bail and  preserved the discretionary power granted by the legislature  on the courts while considering application for anticipatory  bail. It is submitted that the Constitution Bench has refused  to impose any limitation or conditions, which are not imposed  by the Parliament.  6.1   It is further submitted by the learned Counsel  appearing on behalf of respondent no.2 that the decision of  the Constitution Bench regarding duration of anticipatory  bail is not called in question by any judgment.           It is  submitted that there is a clear conflict regarding the duration                                                                 25 _x000c"
